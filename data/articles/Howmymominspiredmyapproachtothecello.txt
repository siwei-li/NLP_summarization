(Cello music)(Music ends)On the flight here, I was reminded about my mom. I'm a self taught cellist, I've never had a lesson. I studied double bass, but I just picked up the cello and started playing because I love doing it. But my mom was an inspiration to me. I did not realize she was an inspiration, because she got her music degree through a mail order course, the US School of Music. While raising two kids, she received a lesson a week in the mail, and practiced. And at the end of a couple of years, she put on a recital. And I'll be 50 this month, and it took me that long to realize that she was that big of an inspiration. I'm just going to keep — yeah, thanks, mom.(Applause)She's also one of the most extraordinary people I know, beyond being a wonderful musician. I want to play a little bit for mom and your moms as well, actually.(Cello music)(Music ends)You know, when you normally hear a cello, you think of this.(Plays Bach Cello Suite No.1)We're not going to do that today.(Laughter and applause)(Drums) (Cello)Hey!(Looped samples of onstage sounds)(Cello music and looped samples)(Music ends)(Applause and cheers)
