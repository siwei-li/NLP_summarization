(Banjo plays)(Banjo and guitar play)(Sings) Is this what it's like to be alive?I reached the point of no returnand I don't know if I've been burnedfrom the burned bridges in my life, thinkin' you were wrong and I was right.Maybe I messed up,either way it's too late for us.'Cause baby I'm old with regret,wishin' I could hold you and just forget.Since I can't I'll just be home but homesick,wishin' you were mine and I didn't hurt you like I did.Can't go back to when we had a chance,wishin' I could have a shot at real romance.Now I realize all the things I could have had were in your cold hands.I'm a fool for a dead romance.Gone, gone, gone.I'm a fool for a dead romance.Gone, gone, gone.I'm a fool for a dead romance.Is this what it's like to fantasizeabout a love that never was alive outside my mind or distance?With time I clearly lost my sight,thinkin' I was wrong to ever leave your side.But time's the harshest judge,makes us think we were in love.And now I'm old with regret,wishin' I could hold you and just forget.Since I can't I'll just be home but homesick,wishin' you were mine and I didn't hurt you like I did.Can't go back to when we had a chance,wishin' I could have a shot at real romance.Now I realize all the things I could have had were in your cold hands.I'm a fool for a dead romance.Gone, gone, gone.I'm a fool for a dead romance.(Banjo and guitar play)And baby I'm old with regret,wishin' I could hold you and just forget.Since I can't I'll just be home but homesick,wishin' you were mine and I didn't hurt you like I did.Can't go back to when we had a chance,wishin' I could have a shot at real romance.Now I realize all the things I could have had were in your cold hands.I'm a fool for a dead romance.Gone, gone, gone.I'm a fool for a dead romance.Gone, gone, gone.I'm a fool for a dead romance.Is this what it's like?
