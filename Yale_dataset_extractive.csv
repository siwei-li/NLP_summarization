0,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-10,"The Harlem Renaissance brought together legions of black writers, artists, musicians, and intellectuals who celebrated black culture and romanticized its connections to an African past. In this lecture, Professor Holloway documents some of the expressions of the Harlem Renaissance (also known as the New Negro Renaissance), the political and cultural movement that claimed Harlem as its figurative capital. In fact, thousands of African Americans flocked to Harlem, and it became the center of a rich cultural and political environment–one always fraught with complications, but still understood to represent the best that black America had to offer. As Professor Holloway shows, white enthusiasts of these newly-admired cultural forms visited Harlem to get a taste of black life. Indeed, without the financial support of the white community, whatever cultural efflorescence that did exist in Harlem would have been significantly less grand. Yet the tensions between white patrons and black artists, as well as between black intellectuals and black artists, made the Harlem Renaissance a complex movement.",":  When I lectured on Monday about Marcus Garvey and a little bit about Father Divine, what I was trying to get at–towards the end was the complicated texture of, for the lack of a better phrase, of– pardon me. There is no single leader for this moment that I’m talking about for today, which is, you know, loosely called the Harlem Renaissance. They were in their element, a place of animals. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,So I make an idle boast;Jesus of the twice-turned cheek,Lamb of God, although I speakWith my mouth thus, in my heartDo I play a double part. Ever at Thy glowing altarMust my heart grow sick and falter,Wishing He I served were black,Thinking then it would not lackPrecedent of pain to guide it,Let who would or might deride it;Surely then this flesh would knowYours had bone–borne a kindred woe. Lord, forgive me if my needSometimes shapes a human creed. And that “it” he’s talking about is civilization. And what he’s really bemoaning, I think, is the fact that it took him so long to understand that these Africanist belief systems, this fashioning of many different kinds of dark gods, that he actually saw something desirable in it as well; that he often wished his god, something you can’t see and can’t hear in the reading of it, but you see in the print, with, you know, he’s capitalizing “He” and “You” often, that he wishes his god were a god that looked black, or looked, you know, black African. And one quick caveat here–and I’ve already–in fact, I’ve already done it–I’ll talk about the Harlem Renaissance and the New Negro–New Negro Renaissance. And it’s also a movement of white infatuation. And when you have such an intense change in places like Chicago, or Detroit, or New York City in terms of demographics, there’s a heightened sense of, of, of cultural tension, and that’s what’s really so important about the Renaissance’s connection to the migration, and why Harlem is often thought of as the, as the, as the–referred to as the Harlem Renaissance, because Harlem does become the focal point for so much of these artistic changes, although they are happening everywhere. A few people even say the Renaissance never ended; it just kind of quieted down. It’s expanded and published as a book, edited by Locke, that is recognized as the bible of the Renaissance, and that book is called Now you remember the, the phrase New Negro goes back to Booker T. Washington’s, you know, popularizing of it at the turn of the century. Locke, a philosopher, was convinced that culture, that thing he’s trying to gather up in the book ¸ culture was a political battleground. And to be sure, this is part of the heritage that many Renaissance artists hailed in their work. That Africa was being hailed and celebrated at all was revolutionary. In the first, you have the Negro in an African setting, an exhortation of the culturally vibrant African past, with the ring shout religious tradition being practiced and drums, dances in the state of ecstasy. And you’ll see in these images I’m going to show you here  themes of, well-stylized forms, but also circles and light. Up here, right here, see somebody hung and a lynch rope coming down. I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young. :  I don’t think we need to spend much time interpreting this poem, but it is seen as, again, one of these great documents that ties together a lot of the different strands of the Renaissance. Was it for blacks, was it for whites, was it for the wealthy, was it for workers? This is also the era of celebrating blackness, celebrating African forms. But it also, Madam C.J. Walker becomes the most powerful black businesswoman, a multimillionaire, by selling hair straightening products and skin lightening creams, idealizing white beauty."
1,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-11,"The 1930s was a decade filled with economic, legal, political, and social controversy. In this lecture, Professor Holloway looks at the Great Depression and the federal government’s responses to it, including the New Deal’s impact on African Americans, both materially and symbolically. As the federal government openly courted their favor, African Americans organized various political groups to monitor federal activities. In the second portion of the lecture, Professor Holloway examines the achievements of the Black Cabinet, the injustices of the Scottsboro Boys’ case, and the efficacy of the “Don’t Buy Where You Can’t Work” campaigns, led in Washington, D.C., by the New Negro Alliance. As much as the 1930s were about retrenchment for African Americans, they also reflected new political possibilities and new forms of political expression within black America. Thus, as Professor Holloway reveals, the roots of the modern civil rights movement are all part and parcel of New Deal America.",":  For the purpose of this week, we’ll essentially be resting in the 1930s, essentially. So the stock market crashes in October Twenty-Nine. So what we consider the essential work of the federal government is, in our contemporary moment is essentially created during the New Deal. But the economy doesn’t actually turn around until the U.S. begins arming Europe as it heads toward Second World War. On the ground, too many federal programs were left to local administrators to run. Now the reason I was flailing here, because there are certain areas the NRA doesn’t address the minimum wage, and I kept wanting to say those things; That’s why I was fumbling. It does not establish minimum wages for people in agricultural sector. Their job, the job, the things they did were mainly accomplished behind the scenes. But we don’t actually know the literal changes they made. There were one or two brother pairs, but they didn’t know each other, essentially. ”A reference to the fact that, that the mob that wanted to kill the Scottsboro boys did not succeed. And, within two weeks, the boys are indicted, tried, and all but one are sentenced to death. And certainly as the Communists saw this as a way to open up a discussion about Southern racism, NAACP thought that, you know, “You’re, you’re pulling too many things together here, and trying to–basically you’re trying to develop racial insubordination in the South. In 1931, the boys were arrested and convicted. Samuel Leibowitz presents new evidence, but was considered too tough on Victoria Price, thus violating Southern codes of honor. And this actually–This is actually another image from Harlem. New cases in thirty-three, in thirty-three, a coalition in thirty-five. The New Negro Alliance is a local articulation–this is local being Washington D.C.–of a larger national phenomenon, “Don’t buy where you can’t work” campaigns. “ And it speaks to this new sort of form of political organizing that I’m suggesting is there with the Scottsboro boys and the, the Black Cabinet. The hold out is the Sanitary Grocery Company. So they’re trading fliers, pamphlets, media bout–you know media shots for a–for a long time. So the Sanitary Grocery Company ceases doing business under that name, and it becomes Safeway. But this is, I mean it’s a humorous coda for those who know Safeway. This is the potential of the new black politics: high politics, low politics, somewhere in the middle politics, and you’re going to start seeing in tomorrow’s lecture and in the, in the lectures over the next couple of weeks, a new kind of organizing mentality, operating at all levels, that starts to change the landscape of the American scene."
2,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-12,"In this lecture, Professor Holloway continues discussing African American political possibilities in the second half of the 1930s by examining the new mentality at work in black America. He focuses on the National Negro Congress, the Marian Anderson Easter Sunday Concert, and the March on Washington movement. These examples reveal the diverse strategies and organizing methods employed during this era, as the federal government learned that it could not afford to ignore black leaders the way it had since the founding of the Republic. Professor Holloway also examines the radical possibilities of this decade, as black Communists and Socialists advanced democratic visions for the country. For a brief moment, these ideas appeared to have traction. Yet as the Cold War marched on, charges of communism would decimate some African American civil rights groups.",":  In the last lecture I set the terms for the week’s discussion, those being retrenchment and political advancement. The Scottsboro boys reaches back to a past of social control, certainly, but also representing in the Scottsboro boys case, in the way the Communist Party gets involved, that there’s a new mentality at work in black America, and new values in–or being seen–the, the, the accused being seen as commodities on a political battlefield. The most important labor leader in black America, is elected its first president. Again, themes from the Niagara Movement, but in this case with the students, a different type of cultural emphasis. I think a hangover, in a sense, from the Harlem Renaissance. Now the Southern Negro Youth Congress is important because of its Communist involvement, certainly, but also because you can see it as a preface to the civil rights activities that defined Birmingham some twenty years later, and that as we’ll see next week, you start seeing a lot of these kinds of activities in other places throughout the South, through other organizations. I’ll leave that alone there for a moment. Its male leaders go off to fight; its female leaders do not remain youthful. Randolph, A. Phil–A. Philip Randolph, he’s the president, is hearing more whispering about Communist involvement in the National Negro Congress, and he’s not happy about it. Now the DAR maintained a strictly segregated policy. Well, the fact is, that’s what Houston was trying to do the whole time, once he got involved, because this is a great way to break down the color line in the school system, using Marian Anderson as a symbolic vehicle. On the day in question, Ickes steps up to the microphone and introduces Marian Anderson. Now whether that’s true or not is a–well I don’t think we remember this speech, so it didn’t really rival the Gettysburg Address. You start hearing a plane flying overhead there. And in fact, as an aside, it’s–the inauguration of Barack Obama, something, I don’t know if I’ll talk about it or not at the end of the class, but when Aretha Franklin stands up to sing she, I mean, it’s a, culturally a very dense inauguration. They’d been working on the Black Cabinet. You just, here’s just somebody’s back standing in front of an audience. But it really was quite a visual spectacle, and I think offers ways for you to think about how you read images, for instance, perspective being very important. By the mid-twenties,  as a journal is actually not doing that well. Efforts are made to get better working conditions and higher wages from Pullman. In fact, the Pullman porters, the U.S. post, the military, over the course of the twentieth century, are the three great ways for black Americans to transition to middle-class status. But as you know, Randolph is a staunch anti-Communist, and as the National Negro Congress develops further, he realizes there’s no place for him any more in that organization. Please talk to Randolph and tell him to call off this march.” It doesn’t immediately integrate all industries."
3,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-13,"In this lecture, Professor Holloway presents an overview of the civil rights events that took place between the end of World War II and  in 1954. A critical survey of the histories behind such famous events as the desegregation of the Armed Forces, the formation of the Congress on Racial Equality (CORE), the elimination of the all-white primary, and the Supreme Court’s  decision demonstrate how complicated the story of the civil rights movement is. Professor Holloway canvasses events on the high political stage as well as in the legal arena to understand the fundamental shift, taking place in the country on racial issues. An examination of civil rights organizing practices and legal strategies in the 1940s, in particular, helps provide a framework for re-periodizing the movement.",":  I want to start with, I guess for lack of a better word, two vignettes. North Carolina required separate washrooms in its factories. And in, and in Washington DC, the custom had prevailed for nearly ninety years. He didn’t sound at all like anybody I knew. That’s when he started talking about ‘niggers’ wanting to go to school with his children and how he wasn’t going to stand for it. He pulled me down and turned me on my back. I looked up into his face, looming close above me like the monster on a movie screen. I covered my eyes with my hands and waited for him to strike me again. Thus begins her journey towards becoming one of the Little Rock Nine. They have to rely on white patrons to make ends meet, but they could turn to the federal government instead, but the federal government, and I started talking about it with the Black Cabinet through Marian Anderson’s concert on Easter Sunday, 1939, the federal government is now standing in, in complicated ways, certainly, but still standing in and keeping an eye on the quality of black life. It’s the Double V campaign, Double V, two Vs: that there would be victory over fascism abroad and victory over racial discrimination at home. Randolph, as you already know, was an anti-communist. You need to understand this; it’s rather important. Among its proposals, the commission suggested anti-lynching and anti-poll tax laws, a permanent FEPC, and strengthen–strengthening the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. The executive orders that grow out of this array of changes are 9980, nine-nine-eight-zero, establishing fair employment practices in the federal government, and the next one immediately, so you can see he’s going on a tear, Executive Order 9981 establishes the President’s Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Forces, the decree that leads to the desegregation order to the military. The military takes its sweet old time desegregating, but the order’s issued in 1948, growing out of this–Truman’s political move to sort of clarify the mess of the Democratic Party, make it known to African Americans that he was going to support them, the Democratic Party would support them. Okay, that’s 1935.Based on the success of that case, Houston brings Marshall over to the NAACP and they start traveling from southern courthouse to a southern courthouse to southern courthouse, filing law–lawsuits for black students and teachers. In 1938, in the case–these are Supreme Court cases by the way–. Lloyd Gaines is the plaintiff and Canada—who is, I’m missing the first name here, It’s the last name of the registrar of the University of Missouri. Houston and Marshall keep plugging away, filing the lawsuits, poking at the system. I mean, the lawyers were, were claiming, “You cannot build a law school in a few months,” and it really was just done in a few months, “designed to educate blacks in the state and suggest that it’s even near equal to what the University of Oklahoma’s already established law school provides.” Southern states recognize this and feverishly start trying to improve black schools, which were horrible. Someone, jurists, legal, legal historians think it was probably going to go against Brown. Now Warren himself did not have a sterling civil liberties record. So people doing some basic psychoanalysis, armchair psychoanalysis, saying Warren is trying–I mean is horrified in retrospect over what he did in a moment of war, what he felt was right at the time, to deny citizenship rights to so many people, and was trying to sort of cleanse himself."
4,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-14,"Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights movement have become embodied in each other. But in this lecture, Professor Holloway asks: what of the other activists in the struggle? What of the other organizations involved in the struggle? And what of the history of the struggle before King reluctantly emerged on the scene? By uncovering the histories of the Montgomery bus boycott, the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, the death of Emmett Till, the Greensboro student sit-ins, and the formation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, one finds differing responses to violence and multiple approaches to attacking racial bias and discrimination. Professor Holloway also draws attention to the gender dynamics of the civil rights movement by considering the inner-workings of the Women’s Political Council in Montgomery, Alabama, the original motivating force behind the 1955 bus boycott, and the great importance of respectability to the movement. This lecture reveals that there was no single civil rights movement, that there were many activists working in a variety of different ways and with varying degrees of success, and that King was a complicated figure, both inspiring and stifling activism.","Just a reminder that the , Spike Lee’s documentary about the, the, the, the murder of four girls in Birmingham, is going to be screened tonight at eight o’clock in WLH–:  One-nineteen.: Now let’s look at the Montgomery bus boycott. And I want to encourage you to go back and look at it now. The Women’s Political Council with Jo Ann Gibson Robinson’s leadership, she’s one of the key figures in it, has already gone to the black ministers in town and the city government in town about their frustration over the way that blacks were treated on the buses and the way they were treated in stores downtown. “ But if nothing else, metaphorically, it’s actually a very important point. And they knew that they could not make a convincing case if they have someone with such failed standards, such immorality in her system, that she’d be the worst example for these women activists. I already told you about Melba Beals’ experience as she’s about to be raped when she’s twelve years old, but we can see in reactions in other places in the South, systemic reactions, the extent or the ways in which there was a logic that blacks had to behave just right because the stakes were so high. If you were known to be a member of the NAACP and worked in Mississippi, well, you know, the boss might decide you don’t have your job any longer, for some other trumped up reason. There are many different versions of what happens. What happens later is of great consequence. His mother insists on having an open casket at the Chicago funeral and the images shock the country. What are the adults asking the children to do for the sake of the movement? Now one final note about the school year and Little Rock. Only a minority of folks rose to the challenge, and accepted it, and pursued it. King is raised in a tradition of ministers. King, though, these things aren’t widely known at this moment in time, fifty-five, is seen as a real future star, and he gets a job in Montgomery, heading the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, which is, much in the tradition of his father and grandfather, the most elite, sort of upstanding and politically conservative, quiescent church, in that particular city. King as a minister is automatically in that group. He fought, fought, fought, but he couldn’t say no. If we are wrong, the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong. If we are wrong, justice is a lie, love has no meaning. And we are determined here in Montgomery to work and fight until justice runs down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream. And by the way, Rustin and Baker are finally getting the attention that they deserve from, from amazing histories that have been written about five or six years ago. But Rustin sees in the success and the violence as a catalytic, catalytic moment of possibility, and that the question becomes not so much, “How great was this moment?” She’s expecting sort of a modest turnout. And out of that organization grows the Southern Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, otherwise known as SNCC."
5,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-15,"In this lecture, Professor Holloway offers a richer portrait of Martin Luther King, Jr. than his “I Have a Dream Speech” speech provides. Though King’s message and delivery are precious moments in this nation’s history, and excerpts are familiar to virtually all American school children, King’s opinion of society and its remedy have been frozen in time and reduced to a few moments of his famous speech. Professor Holloway frees King from his magnificent yet soothing speech in order to appreciate the real world political and social battles that defined his life and the lives of those who fought beside him in the struggle for freedom and equality. By shedding light on moments that have been dropped out of the “master narrative” of the civil rights movement, Professor Holloway demonstrates that the movement was far from reaching a moment of transcendence at the 1963 March on Washington.",":  The song that, I imagine, for many of you needs no introduction, but for a few of you who may not be familiar with it, that’s one of the great anthems of the Civil Rights Movement, “We Shall Overcome.” ”Gary Cooper, for those who don’t know, it’s a different generation, great cinematic hero, often played the good guy, you know cowboys and Indians. Birmingham had already been the witness or home to all kinds of violence. I’m being extremely politic in saying this. Not going nearly fast enough for African Americans and white activists. Meanwhile, marches are being organized in Birmingham, organized from the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, to try to call attention to the general plight that African Americans face in Birmingham, the injustice, injustice of the situation. And by raising the stakes, that means using children. Robert F. Kennedy, he was leading a civil rights agenda for his brother, John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy is beside himself. This is what he was doing, there’s no doubt about it, that King is trying to antagonize the situation and horrify the nation by revealing what Bull Connor would actually do, and Bull Connor took the bait. While all of this is going on, to speak of the sort of the heightened tension around various hotspots in the South and local and states’ rights versus federal rights, James Meredith, a few months earlier, inspired by Kennedy’s election and inauguration, applies for and is accepted at Old Miss, the flagship school in Mississippi, where Mississippi’s elite get trained. The march happens at the very end of August 1963, August twenty-eighth. John Lewis, currently representative of Congress, then the new head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, John Lewis has a chance to go to the microphone, he prepares a speech, the original version of which is in your text. And in many people’s opinions, even if they agreed with Lewis, they’re saying, “There’s no way that you can actually say this, cause you will antagonize to the point, we will, this will kill the civil rights bill.” I’m thinking of other cardinals in the news for other reasons, the last few years–a, a cardinal says, “I’ll leave the podium if you say this.” When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. But Du Bois was talking about “returning, returning from fighting, returning fighting” and King is saying the same thing, “We can never be satisfied,” as long as you can’t vote in Mississippi and as long as there’s no reason to vote in New York. Their death says to us that we must work passionately and unrelentingly for the realization of the American dream. I’m going to play, you know, a portion of it."
6,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-16,"In this lecture, Professor Holloway revisits Malcolm X’s life in order to offer a more nuanced interpretation of the black leader than is traditionally taught. Professor Holloway links Malcolm X to a tradition of black intellectuals and political activists like Booker T. Washington, Marcus Garvey, and Robert Williams, and he explores the philosophy of the Nation of Islam (NOI), the organization for which Malcolm X is the national spokesman before his split with Elijah Muhammad in 1964. In the final year of his life, prior to his assassination by NOI members in 1965, Malcolm X makes a religious journey to Mecca, rejects his prior views on race, starts the Organization of Afro-American Unity, and adopts the name El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. In the remainder of the lecture, Professor Holloway backtracks to explore some of the other historical events that frame the civil rights movement, including Freedom Summer, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, and the 1964 Civil Rights Act.",":  Alright, why don’t we go ahead and get started. The first is from Bullet and the second is from  This is why I say it’s the ballot or the bullet. Is this what makes Malcolm X so different from Martin Luther King and other famous African American leaders? Okay now the Niagara Movement wasn’t calling for violence upon violence, in, in response to violence, self-defense, not that way. We’ll be coming back next to King next week and you’ll–I’ll flesh out that statement more completely. But Malcolm X is older than Martin Luther King by four years. Fard disappears under curious circumstances. Now the Nation of Islam is a very unorthodox version of traditional Islam. Teaching self discipline and self help, being those things that are most desperately needed, often, by those who are in prison, after all. And the rhetorical flair of Malcolm, I’m sorry of Martin Luther King’s speeches–this is also the period of King’s greatest triumphs–aren’t doing anything to change the daily quality, quality of life for most blacks, particularly those living outside of the South. Malcolm X’s rhetoric isn’t necessarily putting food on the table, but when you marry the rhetoric with the establishment of these temples and stores, Nation of Islam stores, and laundries–if you think back to Marcus Garvey’s UNIA, black owned, entrepreneurial opportunities, serving a black community–that’s what the Nation of Islam is doing as well. Elijah Muhammad saw this as an opportunity, as it turns out. All of these are views that he espoused while in the Nation of Islam. In the end, Malcolm X acknowledged that his political views are rapidly evolving, embodied in the fact that he no longer goes by Malcolm X. El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz is the name he adopts during this last conversion. And on July 2nd, in 1964, Lyndon Johnson, Lyndon Johnson succeeds. It provides for full access in places of public accommodation, establishes a permanent Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Despite all the work of the Mississippi Freedom Summer activists, and their success at establishing the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, essentially an alternative to the Democratic Party in Mississippi, the fact is, the chance for blacks to actually vote through, quote, normal channels, official channels, is essentially nonexistent. Democrats are heading towards a convention in August for the Democratic Party. Eventually, six put on–into jail for violating federal civil rights laws, are given three to six years."
7,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-17,"In this lecture, Professor Holloway focuses on the events between 1964 and 1966 that contribute to a fundamental shift in the tone and tactics of the civil rights movement. By examining the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party’s quest to seat alternate delegates at the Democratic National Convention in 1964; “Bloody Sunday” and the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery; the signing of the 1965 Voting Rights Act; and the riots that summer in Watts, a poor neighborhood in Los Angeles, Professor Holloway reveals that people were struggling with the new tactical change in the movement. The militancy seen in Watts was becoming more recognizable and more frequent, partially due to rhetoric but also do to the increasing U.S. military occupation in Vietnam. Impatience was growing not just in urban or northern areas, but all over the country. In the final portion of the lecture, Professor Holloway offers a preview of the first Black Panther Party, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, founded in Lowndes County, Mississippi, and the shifting racial philosophy of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, led by Stokely Carmichael.",":  What I’d like to do today is go back very briefly so we’re all on the same page, moving from events in 1964 through 1966 actually. In my opinion, as I stand here, I not only blame the people who pulled the trigger or did the beating or dug the hole with the shovel, I bury the peace, but not up there with God. From the standpoint of tactics, it’s clear to Johnson and to others–Lyndon Johnson and to others–that by signing in the Civil Rights Act, he was kissing away the Democratic Party in the South. Well, while Hamer is giving this testimony to the credentials committee, Lyndon Johnson, still in Washington, D.C., at the White House, hears about it, knows it’s going out live and is furious, and immediately calls a press conference trying– Bless you–trying to simply distract the media from what’s now airing over the country. Civil Rights Act does not address voting. Thank you, Bull Connor–much like Bull Connor. In this case, the cameras were already there. King asks, asks his followers to kneel and pray along with him and then, in a complete shock to those SNCC leaders who are still beaten and bloody from two days earlier, King tells them to go back to their churches. They were going to press forward and do this all over again. Their struggle is our struggle and we shall overcome.” In June of the same year, sixty-five, at Howard University’s graduate–graduation ceremony, Howard being the most important, largest historically black college and university, essentially mostly funded by the federal government, Johnson at the graduation ceremony says the following:“You do not– excuse me—You do not wipe away the scars of centuries by saying, ‘Now you are free to go where you want, do as you desire, and choose the leaders you please.’ I’m like, “Dad, you know better than this.” Meanwhile, a crowd arrives of citizens and residents of the area. Thirty-five thousand adults are deemed, quote, active rioters. So a lot of people were active as rioters who never, you know, see justice, according to the police, because they’re the ones shooting from windows the police can never get to, for instance. Certainly something tactical by going after those institutions that the residents thought were keeping them down. For white America, all of this happens completely out of the blue. But what is clear is that just as people are struggling with this new tactical change in the movement, got to pursue the black vote, people are clearly struggling with a shift in tone. Oh, that’s my–I have something happening soon, I guess, my computer telling me I have to go. As Carmichael digs a little deeper in Lowndes, he finds, finds a different current though, and he just discovers that trying to register black Lowndes County citizens to vote in the Democratic Party is something he’s really not going to have much success doing. And the LCFO chooses as its mascot the black panther. And this group, as we’ll see next week, becomes the inspiration for the famous Black Panther Party. In January of 1966, Samuel Young, a twenty year-old Navy vet, African American, recruited by SNCC to be an organizer in Tuskegee, he’s killed for using a white bathroom."
8,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-18,"Just as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X have been mythologized in American history, organizations and individuals affiliated with the Black Power call have also been romanticized as well as demonized in such a way that the truth behind their image has been lost. In this lecture, Professor Holloway uncovers the history of black radicalism in the sixties, most famously embodied by the Black Panther Party, and reveals how black power encompassed a call for race pride, the development of black-run organizations dedicated to saving black communities, and also a fascination with an image–one conferred upon black radicals by whites as well as consciously cultivated by African Americans. At the same time, this hyper-masculine, cool, soulful, and dangerous aesthetic obscured some of the important work that the black militants tried to accomplish. In the second half of this lecture, Professor Holloway reveals how groups like the Black Panthers created their own community social welfare programming and maintained links between their cause and that of oppressed people around the world.","<>:  I think maybe I just wanted to be a DJ in another life. I mean, I’m not saying that he didn’t mean these things certainly, but, but the, the scope of what’s actually going to happen, the violence and the rhetoric, is palpable and we are certainly past that moment of the beloved community, with Martin Luther King and his dream in 1963. Stokely Carmichael gets out of jail and tells an assembly out on the lawns, “The only way”–excuse me. It’s not about, you know, trying to get in the front door of a bus or the front door of a restaurant. My notes seem to be all over the place today. It creates incredible friction, and creates a crisis at the state capital. I want to play to you–for you a clip of that circus. Statement of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. All of these efforts have been answered by more repression, deceit, and hypocrisy. Looking at a city like Oakland, with essentially a ravaged social services system, the Panthers saw the need for after-school programs for black children and for hot breakfast programs, things that they just weren’t getting through the school system. You also see, not just in Oakland, but in places throughout the country, with a ranges of success, Panther health clinics opening up. Now Eldridge Cleaver had a particularly important role in cultivating support for the Panther Party and does a lot through , the book I’ve asked you to read this week, or read most of this week. He is, to be as polite as possible, rather homophobic. Now, taking back to the very beginning of this course, when I talked about the ironies of John Jack’s existence. And they offer Carmichael the position of Prime Minister of the Black Panther Party. He is being seen by many people across the political spectrum as the heir apparent of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, although of a different kind of politics, but the heir apparent. And, as it turns out, because the Panthers were so open about courting white support–through cocktail parties, where Eldridge Cleaver would come up and tell, you know, all the whites in attendance about how bad they are, essentially–because the Panthers courted white support, SNCC militants said, “We have–We’ve left whites behind. So these are a number of the events that take us through the late 1960s and into, into the early seventies. They were not cherished by the society and therefore they would feel that they should, well, spit in the face of the establishment."
9,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-19,"As the movement moved out of the South and away from a largely Christian orientation, it became clear that people were prepared to enlarge the struggle so that it became linked to international issues including the war in Vietnam, the spread of capitalism, and the exploitation of developing countries. Yet for every moment of great promise, there was a moment of great confusion and despair. In this lecture, Professor Holloway traces the competing lines of activism, change, struggle, frustration, and political brinksmanship that occurred in the late sixties. He focuses on SNCC’s trajectory, Martin Luther King’s poverty campaign in Chicago, his views on Vietnam, the riots that followed his 1968 assassination, and the Poor People’s Campaign. The remainder of the lecture focuses on the national and international events of 1968 that contributed to this feeling of unrest sweeping the country. As the movement grew beyond its traditional boundaries, the moral and psychological hold it had on America began to lose its strength. As Professor Holloway explains, by the end of the 1960s, it seemed that Americans cared little for the larger and more complicated truths pointed to by black radicals’ political, social, economic, and cultural critique.",":  You’ll remember from last lecture, Gwendolyn Brooks’–what I think at least, is a haunting poem–We real cool. Written in 1966, but really stands in for, in so many ways, this fundamental shift that I’ve been talking about the last couple of lectures, and sort of the mentality from mid-1960s, heading into the end of the 1960s. The cracks start to appear as it struggled to find its own voice, feeling smothered by King’s presence. In the leadership void left behind by Carmichael, you have a cadre of different leaders battling it out, who’s going to be  person representing SNCC.Meanwhile, the organization is infiltrated by the FBI. However, at this moment, sixty-six, partly out of result of searching for the next great agenda for the movement, partly out of the shifting logics of how the U.S. economy is functioning on a global scale, partly out of the radicalism and the internationalist radicalism that starts being articulated more aggressively by SNCC and would soon be articulated by the Black Panther Party, with its Marxist ideology, King really starts to emphasize poverty. This is the next frontier of the movement. So King is in Chicago, setting up shop and by July, the midsummer, things are organized enough and he prepared enough logistically, he organizes a march. So King’s earliest efforts in Chicago are merely symbolic efforts. King organizes a march to call attention like he’s done on so many other occasions to systemic discrimination, and the way it’s been embodied in Chicago, and then at the last minute, tries to cancel it when, when Daley agrees to sign a, a new housing plan. It’s also important–so, so the, the Chicago, the local activists decides, “We’re going to march without King. And his organization and his style just don’t work. I mean LBJ’s no stranger to brinksmanship. This was also not a King that LBJ was going to tolerate. And as you know, Newark is still struggling with the legacy of these, of these, of what happened in the 1960s, the late sixties. In early 1968, a little less than a year after he comes out against the Vietnam War, King issues a call for a massive protest event, called the Poor People’s Campaign. But he would stay put in Memphis until the workers were recognized. But the White House is now closed to him, and since the successes of sixty-three, sixty-four, and sixty-five, King had only been met with a series of setbacks. The change or the restoration of those parts of the city took well over thirty years. If you look at the buildings of the early 1970s, you can tell what’s basically riot architecture: you know, large stone buildings with very small windows that chairs cannot be thrown through. He’s isolated, he’s–I mean essentially not in the Panthers, he’s isolated from SNCC, but people are  thinking that he might be the one to take up King’s mantle. In the wake of King’s assassination, as the riots are cooling down, leaders start to–the other leaders of the civil rights organizations, people in King’s inner-circle are saying, “What are we going to do to honor King? The revolution will be no re-run brothers;  The revolution will be live.: Y’know I jus’ about had my fill  Of Whitey on the moon."
10,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-1,"Professor Holloway offers an introduction to the course. He explains the organization of the course and summarizes some of the key concepts that will be explored over the course of the semester. Professor Holloway uses the African American experience as a prism to understand American history, because, as he notes, the African American experience speaks to the very heart of what it means to be American. He highlights specific examples of the linkage between freedom, citizenship, and the denial of citizenship, including an ex-slave’s epitaph and Confederate scrip. Finally, Professor Holloway shows how the post-emancipation African American experience is a history of political struggle, social protest, social control, cultural celebration, and a history of powerful relevance today for many of its political and cultural symbols.",": “Fellow citizens, pardon me, and allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here today? And am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits, and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us? Anyway, you just need to know that the camera’s there, and really, it shouldn’t be a factor in the course at all. I’ll be talking–I talk often about keywords in lectures. We have two different types of ways to take this class. And I hope that point is frankly very obvious, but one never quite understands or can anticipate all of these things. That stopped after a couple of weeks of college. The story behind this headstone is where I want to start this course, really. I told them about it once I had it on my wall in my apartment at grad school. Somehow these people questing for freedom ignored those people they owned. You could not separate the denial of freedom from the quest of freedom. They may not have wanted to have John Jack be a citizen, but they didn’t want to be like him. Two hundred years later, after John Jack’s attorney produces this epitaph–not quite two hundred  years, let’s say one hundred and eighty or so–Ralph Ellison, one of the great writers of the American past, identifies much of the same phenomenon that John Jack must have identified and that John Jack’s attorney certainly understood. Notions of who belongs, the myths that form our nation states, are all around us. It’s a history of political struggle in this country. I will point out though–I mean actually I don’t know the history of the image, but if you look closely, you’ll see Spanish language up here in the archways. But I will tell you that in this history of cultural celebration, the images that we’ll be seeing are complicated, deeply loaded with many different stories in the same spirit of John Jack’s epitaph. I don’t put any political meaning in that phrase, by the way. I’m not trying to either prop up or push down Barack Obama’s racial affiliations. It found a way to get past its ugly histories and its scars. It is around us, we are subsumed in it, and it is our obligation to learn this history, lest we repeat it."
11,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-20,"The early 1970s marked a moment of social confusion, violence, and cultural excitement carried over from the late 1960s. In this lecture, Professor Holloway canvasses some of the political turmoil of this era and the ways that it was reflected in popular culture. By examining musical achievements like Marvin Gaye’s album, , and some of Stevie Wonder’s songs recorded around this time, it becomes clear that black cultural producers were wrestling with Vietnam, economic despair, ecological despair, poverty, and urban decay. Yet the early 1970s was also a moment of black cultural celebration, and Professor Holloway explores the complicated messages about black sexuality in general, and black masculinity and the role of black women in specific, depicted in blaxploitation films like , , , and .",":  Now you remember from last week that we’re in the moment of phasing out of the 1960s, moving into the 1970s, but of course, human actions, inactions, chronology, is not simply as neat as dates on a, on a calendar as a timeline. The university, under the leadership of Kingman Brewster, the president at the time, does something that people never expected, and actually opened its doors to the Black Panthers. Oh, make me wanna holler The way they do my life. I don’t know what, what is actually happened. And he’s saying that album just brought everything back. And Marvin Gaye really understood the sense of confusion that many people, not just the vets, but certainly in his case, the vets come back trying to figure out what is going on in this country, what do they actually fight for? fluctuates between the international critique and also things happening in U.S. cities, again, this economic despair, I keep coming back to it. You also have, during this moment, this rise of, in, in line with the Black Panther Party, certainly, this rise of a celebration of black masculinity, black virility, and also black cultural celebration. Blaxploitation begins in 1971, begins, you know, all in this moment. It begins with the movie, really an art piece by a man named Melvin, Melvin Van Peebles. There’s a lot of power; but that power has corrupted him. It is a reflection of Black Power militancy, no matter what it’s a counter to white hegemony. There are wrinkles; we’ll get to that in a moment. And again, it’s a, it’s a movie that’s about flight.<Sweet Sweetback’s Badasssss Song plays>>:  It’s actually hard to watch because of the dissonance and the rough film quality. So this is a song celebrating the pusher. Right before this clip, you see the pusherman getting out of bed. He has, as the lyrics in the Curtis Mayfield song, “the baddest bitches in the bed,” getting out of bed with a white woman, which is of course important for all the racial narratives about that kind of coupling possibility, living in a very fancy apartment, and he’s really trying to get out. It’s really quite unclear, but you certainly–I mean in terms of what’s being celebrated here–but you certainly have the lingering part of Blaxploitation, that the man, when it is the white man–not John Shaft of course–the man, usually a person of great authority, structurally in the system, is the cause of degradation in the black community. <>:  And this is the drug kingpin, as it turns out, the person behind Foxy Brown’s boyfriend’s murder, her brother, her brother being set up as well. You watch your mouth or I’ll– No Eddie, later. And then maybe you get to feel what I feel."
12,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-21,"With Martin Luther King’s assassination, the collapse of SNCC, and the self-destruction of the Black Panthers, one would think that all promise had faded in regards to the possibility of black political and social advancement. But in this lecture, Professor Holloway examines moments of hope for black political organization, including Carl Stokes’s 1967 mayoral victory in Cleveland, the formation of the Congressional Black Caucus in 1969, and the 1972 National Black Political Convention in Gary, Indiana. Yet for all of the coalition building taking place, deeper problems revolved around gender. In this lecture, Professor Holloway focuses specifically on the difficulties that black women encountered as they confronted a racist and sexist political system, exemplified by Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s concern over women-headed households in black America. When Shirley Chisholm declared her candidacy for the presidency, and when women on the ground, like Johnnie Tillman, fought for welfare rights or tried to join the modern feminist movement, they faced their “double jeopardy,” that is a second-class status rooted in both racial and gender oppression. Although the early 1970s certainly was not the first time black women began to speak up about their oppression, Professor Holloway reveals that they finally began to be heard, and they formed groups, like the National Black Feminist Organization and the Combahee River Collective, to try to change the national conversation.",":  I just realized a moment ago in looking at my notes that I was caught up in the rapture of this beautiful spring day and left, for the second time in as many weeks, a key set of documents in my office. And they actually coined a phrase, a term for the new economic problems of the mid- and the late-1970s. And it’s been shut down because it was very effective at spreading dismay or anxiety, what the heck we are doing over in Vietnam. However, it is clearly a disadvantage for a minority group to be operating on one principle, while the great majority of the population, and the one with the most advantages to begin with, is operating on another. This is the present situation of the Negro. There is much evidence that a considerable amount–There is much evidence that a considerable number of Negro families have managed to break out of the tangle of pathology and to establish themselves as stable, effective units, living according to patterns of American society in general. Black Americans are outraged by the report and its claim of an almost organic dysfunctionalism. But on the activist front, people are outraged by sort of the blinders on Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s opinions or thoughts or analyses, start forming groups of their own, and one of the key players in this process was a woman named Johnnie Tillman, a black woman, who had been on welfare herself, who helped organize the National Welfare Organization, the NWRO.Tillman becomes one of the galvanizing figures of the NWRO, and really one of its spokespersons. It’s a piece that ran in–that would eventually run in Gloria Steinem’s breakout publication ¸ published in 1972. In this country, if you’re any one of those things, you count less as a human being. He can divorce you, of course, cut you off anytime he wants. On AFDC, you’re not supposed to have any sex at all. If people have motivation, if people only want to work, they can, and they will be able to support themselves and their kids in decency. So as where Moynihan and the, the Moy–the so-called Moynihan report is talking about structures of degradation and such, it is being driven by a moral assessment of women’s role in the black family. Gary, Indiana, just around the bend, in Los Angeles, California, soon enough. It will form like a political action group. And you have the host of the convention, like Gary Hatcher, mayor of–it’s not Gary Hatcher–the Mayor Hatcher of Gary, Indiana, Richard Hatcher, saying, “Look, we’ve got to find a way to bridge the differences,” because  not going to stand on a platform of–and I’m paraphrasing from Baraka’s phone–poem, “Niggers get your guns.” But now these people are elected into office. Shirley Chisholm tapping into this moment, like this will be the moment we can really forge change in this country. And like someone–I mean Chisholm wasn’t running on a  platform, per se; she’s running on, running on a liberal politics platform, but she was seen as unelectable by black elected officials, and also by the women in groups like NOW. As long as the brothers are taken care of, the sisters will be taken care of eventually. It is an organization with an ideologically broad umbrella on feminist issues, broader in its opinion than the National Organization for Women. In the successful rise of the, the feminist movement, black women start telling stories of trying to affiliate with what are essentially white groups. In this era, on the political front, you see a reflection of that commitment to change, where the number of black women who are elected officials skyrockets from fifteen percent of the black elected officials are women in the late sixties, to nearly sixty percent by the end of the 1970s."
13,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-22,"In this lecture, Professor Holloway gives a political biography of Jesse Jackson as a way to help understand the shifting cultural politics of the 1960s, the rise of a different array of politics in the 1970s, and the high politics of the 1980s. Professor Holloway traces Jackson’s ascension into Martin Luther King’s inner-circle, his work in Chicago with Operation Breadbasket and then later with Operation PUSH, his reaction to King’s assassination, his national economic boycotts, and his 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns. In the second half of the lecture, Professor Holloway turns to the national stage, surveying the political and social milieu around President Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan’s administrations, focusing specifically on the latter two. While Jimmy Carter diversified the executive branch of the federal government through White House appointments, Ronald Reagan had a more covert approach to racial politics. By claiming that the federal government was the real problem, and calling for a return to states’ rights, Reagan implicitly supported the centralizing power of racists like Bull Connor and organizations like the KKK. Thus, Professor Holloway explains, as public race baiting fell out of favor, conservatives like Reagan adopted a way of talking about race without ever mentioning it.","Last week we covered the cultural politics of the early 1970s and also the rise of different types of politics in the, in the, sort of the, this–think of a word that actually–in a bowl, a cauldron of politics in the early 1970s, whether it’s grassroots affairs, high politics with the Congressional Black Caucus, and running throughout all of, all of that, the complications imposed by, by a commitment to formal modes of political engagement, while you have someone like Shirley Chisholm coming along. And I mentioned last Monday how that’s actually a harkening to Jesse Jackson’s own politics, and you’ll see this coming out in the middle of today’s lecture. And these are all, you know, concerns that have followed Jackson throughout his entire political career, of course, but they’re starting at that very moment. Jackson is going at the management level. Now you may remember, thinking back to, I don’t know, a month and a half ago in the course, a month ago in the course, that after the success of the Montgomery bus boycott, King was thinking, you know, what, what’s the next thing for him to do, and Bayard Rustin says, “You’ve got to have an organization to capitalize on this energy, and Bayard Rustin wanted it to be called the Southern Leadership Conference, and King changed the name to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Well Jackson splits and forms Operation PUSH, People United to Save Humanity. This is Jackson’s bedrock, his organizing center. I  Minute Maid orange juice, and all of a sudden, it was gone in my house. Now the success of the boycott with Coca-Cola and other corporations inspires Jackson to do something more. He runs in 1984, and it’s largely a symbolic campaign, that is practically scuttled from the start by Jackson’s loose sort of “politics makes strange bedfellows” affiliation with Louis Farrakhan from the Nation of Islam. Now we really know what’s up with this particular individual. And in fact, in eighty-eight, he terrifies the Democratic leadership when he starts beating their people, their likely candidates. You know, blacks, of course, are going to be his strongest base, people working in labor unions, people trying to organize into labor unions, the agricultural workers, reaching out to women, to the poor. And then during this moment of great dawning awareness of the AIDS crisis, HIV and AIDS crisis, he’s reaching out to people suffering from HIV and reaches out to the homosexual community, something that was quite shocking for Jackson. And he sees Reaganomics as quite morally bankrupt. So when we’re talking about putting White House appointees in place, it may sound kind of trivial today, but you need to understand that there has been an erasure of black presence at the federal level, especially from the South–and, and Carter brings up an army of, of southern folks into the White House. Andrew Young, former civil rights activist extraordinaire, he’s a United Nations ambassador, big deal, but meets with Yasser Arafat without authorization. Oh one thing I forgot to mention, part of the economic challenges here is incredible oil crises. The Middle East is rising up in a coherent way that hadn’t been seen before and is crippling the United States over oil. Now it’s important to belabor the point, just in case, just to make sure you don’t miss it. And this is where Reagan’s announcement is so particularly important."
14,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-23,"In this lecture, Professor Holloway discusses the connections between media and high politics during the late 1980s and 1990s and reveals the ways that race was replaced by a series of keywords–such as crime, drugs, and welfare–that acted as racial signifiers in our national discourse. An examination of the political rhetoric from the George H.W. Bush/Michael Dukakis campaign, including the infamous Willie Horton advertisement, as well as racially-infused persons and incidents such as Bernhard Goetz, the “Subway Vigilante;” Charles Stuart; the Central Park jogger case; Senator Jesse Helms’s “Angry Hands” advertisement; the murder of Latasha Harlins by Soon Ja Du, a Korean shopkeeper; the Rodney King beating; and the riots and rebellion in South Central, Los Angeles following the acquittal of the white policemen who beat him all reveal the special coding that linked people’s awareness of race and crime and the ways that the media reinforced the stereotype that crime was the special province of the black male. In the remainder of the lecture, Professor Holloway discusses the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill controversy, essentially a manifestation of the three-ring circus that was racial politics in the 1990s.","On Monday I was talking about looking at the cultural politics and the high politics of the nineteen–well, canvassing from the mid sixites, but really covering the 1970s and into the eighties through Jesse Jackson and his presidential–well, his politics, political rise and his presidential ambitions. So one could, you know–some critics were saying, “Well, he speaks about a Rainbow Coalition, but he’s still talking to black America in a black voice.” And I honestly, I was younger at the time, not paying complete attention, but I honestly don’t recall Reagan saying in public any critical or racist comment that one could say is  racist or  racialist in this kind of critical way, even though quietly, and behind the scenes, Reagan’s racial politics left much to be desired as far as black America was concerned, of course. And he lost because Reagan was able to convince people who were, I mean, you know, moderate Democrat’s that Reagan’s agenda is the one that served them best. These are very real things, but also popularized in our media in very fantastic ways. A year later, he attacks a Maryland couple, raping the woman, flees, is caught in October of eighty-seven. It’s the best version I’ve, I’ve been able to find, actually. It shows the image of Willie Horton, his mug shot. Jesse Helms, senator from North Carolina,  conservative, once a Democrat, had left the Democratic Party to become a Republican, very powerful. You have the white working-class hands holding this paper. I don’t, I confess, I didn’t put it down in my notes, but the swing is something like eight or ten percent between what he goes in as and what people come out as. It’s a moment in which you see a racial codification, codification, a national racial script of “blacks are criminals” and Watts, having been, you know, burned into our minds through a lot of the cultural politics in the 1980s, with the, with gangs going crazy, the Cripps and the Bloods. The fact is, the riot was happening everywhere. A white guy hears that his friends are in trouble, caught near the vortex of the riot. What the script didn’t read is the fact that the people who saved Denny were some older blacks who saw this happening on T.V., knew the intersection, got in the car, ran over to him, saved him, got him in the car, took him to the hospital. But he had lost control over his own virtual projected image. In the grandest theater of politics, high politics, is that revolving around a Supreme Court nomination. He had just, just been elevated to the bench. And I have testified for five full days under oath. I have endured this ordeal for a hundred and three days. Reporters sneaking into my garage to examine books I read. No job is worth what I have been through, no job. Mr. Chairman, (later on in the excerpt) I am a victim of this process and my name has been harmed, my integrity has been harmed, my character has been harmed, my family has been harmed, my friends have been harmed."
15,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-24,"In this lecture, Professor Holloway discusses how race influenced public policy by examining some of the key cultural symbols of the past few decades, all in an effort to answer the question: how is race used in our society? Professor Holloway discusses Bill Clinton’s policies in particular, honing in on his ability to connect with the African American community, the controversy surrounding Lani Guinier’s cabinet appointment, and his National Dialogue on Race. He then turns to California to examine the passage of Propositions 187 and 209, which begin to call into question common notions about civil rights legislation and affirmative action in our nation. In the remainder of the lecture, Professor Holloway talks about four landmark court cases–, , , and –to shed light on the way race began to operate in a legal setting, as well as the general dumbing down of discourse in politics and media about race, in the post-civil rights era.","Last week we spent a lot of time dealing with high electoral politics, canvassing the career of Jesse Jackson, scooting past Ronald Reagan’s and George Bush’s and–presidencies and the campaign, the Bush-Dukakis campaign, for, you know, the Willie Horton ad and the way, and the way in which racial conversations become subverted into something else, although still remaining quite racial in the context of 1990s politics, and something, a process that began decades earlier, certainly, with the civil rights successes or excesses, depending on one’s politics. Now in the last two lectures of the course–I can’t believe we’re already here, but we are–I want to continue with my focus on post-civil rights presidencies and public policies, examining in particular how race affected public policy and how cultural symbols still do so many, so much heavy lifting for a much more complicated real world in which we all live. So it is–it was an embrace of democracy, letting the little person have a, a chance to say something, and it was a process that had been embraced by Republican-nominated or controlled Department of Justice. Now the story’s much more complicated than this, but the, the construction of the image was that the welfare queen was the person responsible for being a real drain on the system. And he comes back from Camp David saying, you know, “I’ve looked at this thing more carefully, and, you know, her views are not in line with the kind of politics that I want to practice.” And it was about addressing a fiscal crisis in healthcare in the state. Affirmative action’s killed in the UC system. They don’t want to be considered racist, after all. And this really is a theme of the American political thought, social and cultural thought, of the last twenty or thirty years, lowest common denominator does a  great job of appearing first. The actual picture is the one on the right. Now you had these town hall meetings across the country to talk about our current conversation about race. And the moment kind of implodes right away when the commission comes together to sort of organize itself and Angela Oh, a Korean attorney in Los Angeles, tremendously strong record when it comes to civil rights law, she clashes immediately with John Hope Franklin. The commission effectively becomes a, a dead letter, had a few conversations. I want to talk about four court cases, three from the 1990s and one from 2003. Most of them are Supreme Court cases, not all of them though. So  starts to chip away at the Voting Rights Act. So it would go from one black neighborhood to another black neighborhood. Compelling interest, strict scrutiny, narrowly tailored. You got a incred–you have to have an incredibly strong case if you’re going to press a, quote, “racial iss–issue,” and hope to have it succeed. Nineteen ninety-six, state of Texas, it’s not a Supreme Court case. But it did say–you know, I’m making up the numbers in the schematic–if one hundred points is what you need to get admitted to the University of Texas law school, if you’re African American, we’re going to give you ten more points. You have friends of the court, petitions being filed by a whole bunch of people, and you have a really fascinating coalition being formed by corporate interests and retired military generals, that if one takes a stereotype in mind, they think, “well these are very conservative populations.” George Bush White House comes out in support of the plaintiffs."
16,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-25,"In this final lecture, Professor Holloway offers a survey of some of the main themes and ideas of the course, including citizenship, uplift and respectability, political radicalism, cultural politics, and racial symbolism. The final two questions he grapples with are 1) what does it mean to be “post-racial” and 2) how is race used in our society? In order to propose answers to these questions, Professor Holloway examines Barack Obama’s election; his 2008 inauguration; and his speech, “A More Perfect Union,” given during the campaign. He also provides some examples of the ways raced is used in the American landscape to distract attention from class and gender; to sell products, including Uncle Ben’s rice and Aunt Jemima’s pancakes; to suggest a progressive commitment to equality; to draw in tourist money; and to heighten emotions, as illustrated by some of the ways that New Orleans’ residents were depicted during Hurricane Katrina. In the end, Professor Holloway argues that race is used in ways that are, whether intentionally or by accident, at best simplistic and at worst destructive, often because we are unwilling to talk or think about these issues in complicated ways. He then leaves the students with one final question: how will you use race?","You know, I always find it shocking that you, you get to spring break, and you come back, and you’re like, “Oh my god, six more weeks. This is a major thing that we’ve been talking about, I’ve been trying to impart to you the last couple of lectures, certainly, but it’s been there throughout the course, the great divide between the rhetoric of our political leaders or our political activists, politically engaged people, and what social reality is. Dealing with issues of leadership of course, and uplift. They had to reflect or embody the kind of values that they felt the nation could understand. This is the scar that really defines the country. And, goodness, I’m forgetting the talking head that said as much, but after Barack Obama’s election, it’s like, “Look, African Americans, basically you’ve got nothing else to complain–I don’t want to hear any more whining.” I actually had a conversation about this the night after Barack Obama was elected. And I’ll argue that it’s more complicated. But from a textual standpoint, and the way in which the inauguration was really quite historically minded, was really quite something, and the way that that history was experienced or acknowledged differently, that many people basically didn’t understand the subtext of Aretha Franklin’s performance, or the subtext of Reverend Lowry’s performance, or even the night when Obama was elected, at Grant Park in Chicago, his invocation of words that are sort of central to the Civil Rights Movement heritage, quotes Martin Luther King, but never references King. I’m not going to talk about it at the beginning of the course. And then, as we are heading towards spring break, that moment of, you know, “Boy, we’re all so tired and we’ve just got to struggle through the last six weeks of the course,” then the news starts to break about Reverend Wright, Obama’s pastor in, in Trinity Church, Rev–Reverend Jeremiah Wright and his racial views, a church that he’d been leading for a long time and Obama had gone to. It was an acknowledgement that everyone had to be more honest about racism, everyone, about the racism they express or feel, and that they had to recognize that race was often used as a veil, as it were, to mask other issues. People didn’t know what to do with it, and certainly didn’t know what to do with it from a, a politician running for something. It allows us to engage in simple coding of behaviors, of people, of types. Race is used in that way, okay, but in this case, thinking about the way that race is the veil that hides other things. And the website, it is, it was really quite a work of art, but in the version five years ago, you could walk around his desk and open up the day planner, and it would talk about him, “wink, wink,”–and I’m very closely paraphrasing–having libations with the southern sen–southern, southern senator. People think that looks like, you know, a very professional Latina. Now this young man, as it turns out–and this was taken at, at, like a student bazaar. Race is used in socially progressive ways, even if sometimes accidentally. This is an image that needs no narration. (This is from,  excuse me, October ninety-eight. If you haven’t used your voice lately, consider this an invitation. ”African Americans gathering together to purchase this advertisement, railing against other African Americans and blacks and whites, of course, on both sides of the line, about who can speak for the race and what that race is going to say. I don’t have time to do that, but I want to show you two images from the moment and talk about the way that race factored into it. I’m not engaging it, but the pictures ran right next to each other, and we are all so hardwired to presume that the person writing this sentence, or the editor putting together, has tripped over a racial fault line, that they can’t see anything but a criminal in this image, and a citizen in the previous one. Black and brown people are talked about refugees, although they were citizens. And I simply want to ask you, how will you use it?"
17,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-2,"In this lecture, Professor Holloway gives a brief summary of what was happening in the decades leading up to the Civil War, including the Missouri Compromise, the Dred Scott decision, and John Brown’s raid at Harpers Ferry. He discusses the Civil War, focusing specifically on the Emancipation Proclamation and the Conscription Acts of 1863. Professor Holloway spends the duration of the lecture focusing on the labor and racial tensions that led to the New York City draft riots and their aftermath. The crucible of the Civil War, he argues, gives a very clear picture of what it means to be a citizen and what it means to be American. Professor Holloway then gives specific examples of how citizenship was linked to freedom, how freedom was linked to race, and how the tensions between these linkages produced extreme violence.",":  Yesterday, Monday’s lecture, we were outlining the expectations of the course conceptually and practically. I ask no , proud and high,To arrest the gaze of the passers-by;All that my yearning  craves,Is bury me not in a land of slaves. Who has greater authority, the federal government or the states? In 1857, we don’t want to lose sight of Dred Scott himself. But she gives him and his family their final freedom. It’s unholy, according to John Brown, and he recognizes–or he believes the way to solve this problem, since the legal process isn’t working, since the process of moral suasion isn’t working, is to get guns. “You’re such an important leader for African Americans. And Douglass says–I mean, I wasn’t there for the conversation, but–“John, you’re crazy.” And during that trial, John Brown becomes seen as a messianic hero to many people. It means, curiously, not much in a practical sense. But what is clear is that at the moment of the Emancipation Proclamation, the Civil War  become about slavery. Now the war is about slavery, at least in this sort of cultural politics of the moment. If you had three hundred dollars, you could buy yourself an exemption. It’s about emancipating these black slaves. In addition to those things I just mentioned, in New York, there are labor tensions. There is a fear adding to this labor tension, has an ethnic and racial aspect to it–there’s a fear now that since January of 1863, since Lincoln freed the slaves, these slaves are going to end up in New York City. On July 11th, a first lottery is held for conscription. The Colored  Orphanage, a very large building there to take care of abandoned children, the crowd sees this place as a site of threat–I guess you’d say it’s threat, but something given to blacks that the Irish didn’t have the benefit of. One story is particularly illustrative, not a happy story of course. Federal troops, who are now coming into the city trying to quell the riot as it moves to different places, federal troops arrive, and they cut down his body. Just as you had William Williams being murdered to chants of “Don’t hire niggers,” inflammatory declaration, in Abraham Franklin’s case, you have chants coming out from the crowd, inflammatory in a different way."
18,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-3,"Between 1865 and 1877, several plans were developed by which the Confederate states could be readmitted to the Union and the residents of the states given full citizenship rights. It was far from clear, however, which plan would do a better job maintaining the social peace and protecting African Americans’ ability to earn a wage, raise a family, own land, and exercise the right to vote. In this lecture, Professor Holloway outlines the contours of the Ten Percent Plan, Presidential Reconstruction, and Radical Reconstruction, and he explains how these plans embraced a variety of approaches to reuniting the disparate states. As Professor Holloway explains, Reconstruction greatly enhanced the rights of African Americans, while also circumscribing their lives by new political, economic, and social initiatives.","The employer must have some sort of punishment. We can see in this quote how politics, labor, and free will are intertwined. Before he dies, however, and after his reelection, he starts working on plans to complete emancipation. At the end of 1865, The Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery is passed. You enter into phase of Presidential Reconstruction followed by Radical Reconstruction. Plan moves forward, and Johnson could not have been more wrong about what would happen. And so Congress, the Republicans in Congress, they now control the Congress, sets about fighting Johnson at every turn. Under this new Reconstruction plan, the South is divided into five military districts. If you’d been a slave, it doesn’t matter. What is even more astonishing, I’ll repeat this fact in about ten weeks or eleven weeks, is that the number of black elected officials in the federal government, House of Representatives and Senate, blossoms during this era, at the end of Reconstruction, which I’ll start talking about in the next lecture, that those numbers start to evaporate, and the numbers do not return as far as federal representation of blacks coming from the Southern states. Now I’m lumping all of these things together here. You clearly should be on that labor contract, and what are you doing here?”Some Black Codes would say that blacks couldn’t steal labor or else they risked a five hundred dollar fine, I mean a ridiculous amount of money. This way they would not be seen in public spaces. This was all for the good of the woman, this is for the black women, they should really be in their natural habitat. So you take all these things together, and again, I’ve lumped many different state’s Black Codes here, it’s clear that while everyone wants the Southern economy back on track, I mean everybody does, there’s no rational way of justifying doing it via the Black Codes. It really begins in earnest in the mid-1860s or the later 1860s, it is still popular in the South through the 1940s. But there were also expectations about land ownership, that they would have land they could work themselves, and there were expectations the federal government would be the entity to help blacks navigate their arrival to full citizenship rights and property ownership. The Field Order, declared in 1865, doesn’t redistribute land, but there is the expectation that the government is going to do so through the likes of violence perhaps, with General Sherman, or through an orderly attempt at giving assistance, and that’s through the Bureau of Freed Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, more often known as the Freedmen’s Bureau. To say that there was an educational system for blacks is ludicrous up to this moment in time. What are we going to do with these blacks? But even though the Klan is wiped out, you can see through this era, 1865 to 1877, rising tides of resentment, chaffing by white Southerners, rising tides of–I guess one might just say impatience by black Americans in “When are we going to have real change?” And if you’re thinking I’m over-reading these things, let me just show this last image that sends a message to Northerners who are coming down to save the South, take over the South, occupy the South–carpetbaggers, people who would load up their things in a bag from the North, come down to the South and set up a government, set up a business and take advantage of Southern resources, certainly a lot of them did."
19,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-4,"After the massive cultural shift that the South endured under Reconstruction, white Southerners were determined to fight back. In this lecture, Professor Holloway discusses the complicated meaning of Redemption as white Southerners rose up, reclaimed, and redeemed that which they thought was theirs. During this era, African Americans experienced extreme forms of violence as whites guaranteed the return of power, including the resurgence of the KKK, as well as gerrymandering and poll taxes to ensure the elimination of blacks as a voting class. In the second half of the lecture, Professor Holloway focuses on the ideas of civilization and manliness, lynchings, and anti-lynching campaigns. Fears of rape and ideas of white womanhood frequently served as the justification for the systematic psychological and economic terrorism of African Americans during the “Rise of Redemption.”","This lecture is taking us from the end of Reconstruction, 1877, canvassing an array of events that actually go up to the, well to the present day in certain ways, but in a recorded way, in an official way, until the 1960s. So any number of nativist and racist hate groups that are being formed in this moment of cultural anxiety, I guess is the most polite way to put it, cultural, economic, social anxiety in the white South and a determination to reclaim it on its own terms. Crops that were owned and tilled by blacks were destroyed. So there is sort of a scorched earth policy by citizens, white citizens of the South to reclaim what was theirs, to get blacks off the land, to destroy their property. But it is sort of always there at some level as a manifestation of cultural and psychological anxiety. And then famously, of course, literacy tests. But a funny thing happens, is that it becomes–it starts becoming successful, and there’s a realization by the political elite: “My god, if these poor whites and poor blacks start  working together, we’re in trouble.” And when you have a set of rules or–not rules–a set of social order being bestowed upon the South by the Klan, that’s preying upon racial anxiety, as well as going against Catholics and Jews, but preying on racial anxiety, you start seeing fissures in the Populist sentiment just as quickly as they appeared. All these other factors certainly are around that helps define who America is, you know, class differences, differences about possibilities related to your gender. By the late 19 century,  leader of the race; there’s no disputing that fact. The statistics on lynching are sketchy at best. Lynching is not a phenomenon you see during an era, during–prior to the Civil War. Talking about legal justice: if we can’t have our criminals be brought to court and tried. Ida B. Wells lives in Memphis, Tennessee, and of course she hears about the scourge of the black male attacking white womanhood and raping women and children. Lynching was, and remains, a horribly violent and grotesque act. Ten years ago–in fact, gosh, exactly ten years ago–small gallery in New York City, the Roth Horowitz Gallery, assembles an exhibit called “Witness: Photographs of Lynchings from the Collection of James Allen,” a white man who collected photographs and postcards of lynching scenes. This is a curious phenomenon, by the way. At these festival lynchings especially, you would have photographers present who would take pictures, not for the historical record, but to sell next to the kneecaps and genitals in the storefront window. This is the same studio from another image."
20,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-5,"In the closing decades of the 1800s, African Americans witnessed the end of Reconstruction, the Redemption of the white South, and increased threats to their political, economic, physical, and psychological well-being. Historians often refer to this era as the “nadir,” the lowest point, in the post-Emancipation black experience. But, as Professor Holloway explains in this lecture, the oppressive realities of black life did not silence the most dedicated black activists. During this time, a new generation of black political and intellectual leaders, including Alexander Crummell, Anna Julia Cooper, and W. E. B. Du Bois, dedicated themselves to “uplifting” blacks politically, economically, and morally. As Professor Holloway reveals, uplift meant different things to different people, acting as both a subversive and conservative ideology.",":  Let me begin the lecture with the keywords for the lecture. Anyway, Crummell does get an education, becomes a minister, and then heads off to Cambridge University in 1848, excuse me, 1845. So he is gone from the country during the great sectional crisis. But by the time Crummell leaves for Liberia, he actually is advocating colonization. Crummell believed that at one time, black Africans were at the top of the civilizational ladder, top of the hierarchy. The Talented Tenth would be the ones to save the race. There were in fact glimmers of hope and activism, even though it grew out of a reality of despair. It’s about doing work more slowly than you possibly can. So they had the leisure time to think about long-term solutions. The American Baptist Publication Society refused their contributions. Serious breach appears in 1895 when a number of blacks come together, Southern blacks, too frustrated any longer to abide by the American Baptist Home Mission Society’s edicts, and forms its own society, the National Baptist Convention. There’s cultural and intellectual societies as well. W. E. B. Du Bois, someone who–a lot of you may see “Du-bwah” when you see the name, it’s “Du-boys,”  that’s the way his family pronounced it–W. E. B. Du Bois, who we’ll hear more about tomorrow, and we’ll hear about intermittently throughout the course, a man of incredible importance in the 20th century African American experience–Du Bois had just received his PhD from Harvard, and is the first vice president of the organization. But that was sort of, I mean I’m simplifying it, but the ANA did not offer much in transactional change for black America, but it’s articulating a vision that the way to save the race was through developing the intellect, civilizing the race with its most educated men. And they also conducted basic agitation for child welfare reform. It was subversive, since it was helping educate and clean up poor and unclean people. Cities and streets literally built on top of filth, of refuse, excrement. But uplift from NACW’s perspective, or it’s–the way it interpreted uplift, was also quite conservative, because NACW membership recognized in itself the express need for them to clean up the race; that the duty–I used the phrase, the word earlier in the lecture–it was the duty of the black middle and upper class, especially the women, to save the race, to clean it up and to get the poor and dirty blacks, Southern blacks, to learn how to behave respectably. Think back to the last lecture, the manliness and civilization, respectability floating through all of that. We can see in this quote the way in which the ideology of the Talented Tenth was driven by commitment to uplift the race and that this commitment to uplift the race was driven by the belief that the black poor, the black unwashed, were a negative drain on all blacks in America. ”Okay, I’ll stop there, and we’ll begin on Wednesday talking about–we’ll focus on Wednesday talking about Du Bois and his great foil, Booker T. Washington, and all of the different competing ideologies that are expressed in this time of incredible change for black America."
21,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-6,"In this lecture, Professor Holloway explains the two major schools of thought that emerged at the end of the century to solve the problems of black social and economic distress. The accommodationists, like Booker T. Washington, believed that the quickest way to improve the quality of black life was to forge a social peace with powerful whites, temporarily accepting the continued separation of the races and advocating vocational education as a pragmatic way for blacks to improve their lives. Opposed to Washington were people like Anna Julia Cooper and W.E.B. Du Bois who embraced assimilation and saw higher education as the cure-all to racialized problems. Du Bois, in particular, is famous for his assertion that it would be the “Talented Tenth” of the race who would lead blacks to a better life.",":  On Monday we talked about uplift and its various ways one can interpret uplift–and I know you had a lot of that information in the Tera Hunter reading, but it’s really one of these sort of foundational issues for this class I wanted to sort of labor over for a while. It wouldn’t make any sense, but understand this timeline. So in this three year window, you have the assertion of religious, organizational, and secular independence with the National Baptist Convention, the death of an icon, Frederick Douglass, the rise of another icon in Booker T. Washington, the formation of a women’s political organizing association and social organization, a  important Supreme Court decision, the founding of one of these elitist attempts to solve race problems, to uplift the race, and in 1898, the death of one of those icons, representing the leaders in the Talented Tenth. From the mast of the unfortunate vessel was seen a signal, “Water, water; we die of thirst!” ran up from the distressed vessel, and was answered, “Cast down your bucket where you are.” To those of my race who depend on bettering their condition in a foreign land or who underestimate the importance of cultivating friendly relations with the southern white man, who is their next-door neighbor, I would say: ‘Cast down your bucket where you are; cast it down in making friends in every manly way of the people of all races by whom we are surrounded. Cast it down in agriculture, mechanics, in commerce, in domestic service, and in the professions. While doing this, you can be sure in the future, as in the past, that you and your families will be surrounded by the most patient, faithful, law-abiding, and unresentful people that the world has ever seen. He’s telling the white industrialists, the agricultural leaders, you know, “You’re trying to import immigrant labor. It is a badge of servitude to force the separation of the races in public accommodations. Would only, you know, only by declaring his race would people realize that he was breaking a law in the first place. So when you take these two moments together, Washington’s speech and Plessy, you can see that for many, this embodies sort of the low point that I referenced in Monday’s lecture, the low point of the post-emancipation African American experience, certainly in the realm of political rights, equal rights, full citizenship rights. Now Hampton and Tuskegee are still around today. Well, the alternative to Washington and his accommodationist politics is embodied in W. E. B. Du Bois. Now it’s important to remember that Anna Julia Cooper joined the debate first, arguing in , published in 1892, that the race would be saved by investing in higher education. But the fact is, for better and for worse, the debate has been crystallized into a Du Bois-Washington debate. ”Manly self respect is the most important thing. Mainly because it reflected a large part of his own life experience, and a glance at his biography makes this much clearer. Again, that idea, sort of that’s where the seat of civilization is. Now it’s the undergraduate curriculum like crazy, and I understand it’s even being taught in some high schools. As Ralph Ellison would mention some forty or fifty years later in his book, the differences that rendered blacks invisible to white America. It’s in the reader, the manifesto, the Niagara Movement’s call to arms."
22,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-7,"In this lecture, Professor Holloway documents the “Great Migration,” beginning in the first decade of the twentieth century and continuing with increasing pace until the mid-1920s. During this time, black Americans relocated from the rural South to the urban North. This general shift in the population marked a moment of self-determination for African Americans, demonstrating that they were prepared to leave behind the lives they had made in the South for better opportunities elsewhere. It is important to see these migrations as a form of social protest against the limited political and economic opportunity in the South, racial violence, and the KKK, which was reborn and flourished in the early 1920s. As Professor Holloway reveals, urban life in the North was frequently cruel and often difficult, but it was also a life forged of free will and absent a regional and cultural history of forced bondage. The remainder of the lecture focuses on how whites’ racial anxieties were manifested in the cultural realm, using D.W. Griffith’s popular film ",":  I want to start with a poem, play the audio of it for you. They got the judges They got the lawyers They got the jury-rolls They got the law They don’t come by ones They got the sheriffs They got the deputies They don’t come by twosThey got the shotguns They got the rope We git the justice In the end And they come by tens. So we think of–of the forces in the South that, or the  reality, the daily lived reality on the ground in the South, you can see that just the determination to leave, to get out, was a response to the political and economic situation. We can finally get the so called negro problem”–this was a popular phrase of the age–“the negro problem would leave once blacks left town.” A little pest that comes up from Mexico, sweeps across Texas and into southeastern US. This job scarcity in the South is also an economic–and the South is essentially an economic colony of the North, and then the North has a decreasing supply of immigrant labor, as you move forward into the twentieth century, as a result of state conflict in European theaters, heading towards World War I. Just take these things together, there’s a decreasing reason to stay in the South and the lure of jobs in the North. Bags of the  would be bundled up, thrown on trains, and they would appear in say Montgomery or Huntsville or, you know, other southern towns. And the numbers are really quite striking. Just between–this is just to get a sense of things. So radical changes in just a ten year period of time. This is the era when Harlem becomes known as a black enclave. I mean pestilence, horrible sights, horrible locations. It’s a job, certainly, as long as the labor union stays on strike. Now one thing I–I also want to make clear before moving into the next phase of the lecture is thinking about, as we’re trying to unpack what migration really was, it’s important to realize that migration wasn’t just blacks working on the southern farms, all of a sudden, you know, in a week’s time, they’re working in a mill in Chicago. It’s important to understand there are other things that were developing within white America–white southern America that complicated the nature of black-white relations in the South, and that–the most important force is the Klan, the KKK.Now the Klan, you’ll remember, was destroyed at the national level during Reconstruction. The fact that it’s happening at the same time blacks are trying to leave the South, in a real outflow, is no coincidence. The book as well as the movie, and I’ll only be talking about the movie, is a depiction of Reconstruction, but from a point of view that was entirely sympathetic to the southern community, southern mentality. Now the basic storyline tracks the rise and fall of the South, as told through the experiences of two different families. These are divisions that–these are parts of the country that should love each other. It depicts blacks’ social and political intransigence and the systematic disenfranchisement of southern whites. But there are some representatives, and you can see them there, sitting there quietly."
23,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-8,"In this lecture, Professor Holloway expands our understanding of “The Great Migration” by looking at what happens when African Americans settled in Northern and Midwestern cities. He examines the 1917 East St. Louis race riot, the 1919 Chicago race riot, and the NAACP’s Silent Protest Parade from New York City’s Fifth Avenue to Harlem. The second portion of the lecture is on African American soldiers’ experiences abroad during World War, their rising expectations for citizenship rights when they return, the new militancy that they espoused, and the racial backlash against them by whites. Black soldiers, returning to the U.S. after risking their lives in war, were lynched in uniform. Responding to this backlash, Professor Holloway shows how civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois and poet Claude McKay foreshadowed the new political climate in which African Americans would assert their rights.",":  So you remember that I began the last lecture playing a poem by Sterling Brown called , documenting the kinds of local social trauma and challenges that African Americans had to face in a sharecropping South. So he’s talking about World War I. The U.S. is not yet involved. That which the German power represents today spells death to the aspirations of Negroes and all darker races for equality,  freedom and democracy. You know, there’s the political intransigence of the South, of course, the terror and lynch law, but jobs were really one of the animating–core animating features. The striking workers were furious, of course. When the dust settles down, we know that nine whites and at least forty blacks died in the riots in East St. Louis. Some of the violence happens in the South. He strays over some unmarked line separating the races in the water. When these white gangs start moving into territories beyond their own turf, like the South Side of Chicago, it was not uncommon during these riots for blacks to set upon them, to defend their turf. They weren’t worried so much about black soldiers, say from Chicago, being trained down in a base in Alabama, as long as they were on the base. They’d be reorganized overseas into their proper military structure, but they also–and they–these are black troops I’m talking about here–weren’t always fighting under the U.S. flag. I’m not going to categorize all blacks and all whites working a certain way. It is of the utmost importance that every effort be made to avoid profoundly estranging American opinion. They felt they had the right to socialize with whomever they wanted to. We sing: This country of ours, despite all its better souls have done and dreamed, is yet a shameful land. They had difficulty securing jobs or decent housing. I can’t write like him, but I can read the–I can read the poem with a more–a more appropriate voice, I’ll say. McKay and others, you know these people who traveled to Russia and then the Soviet Union, trying to find answers, you actually have–and I’m glad you asked it, because I won’t be talking about it so much in this class, I don’t think–you have throughout the 1920s, thirties, and into the forties, mostly in the 1930s, certainly the rise of pop–the popular rise of Communism amongst black Americans. You know, these were the middle-class in many ways."
24,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-9,"In this lecture, Professor Holloway discusses the New Negro mentality, a new black consciousness forged out of political and economic frustration and the cultural shocks of the Great Migration. The New Negro ideology was articulated on a wide scale after World War I, when the promises of democracy at home went unfulfilled. Marcus Garvey best articulated this new consciousness through his Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), the first organized grassroots mass protest movement in African American history. Garvey advocated black pride and autonomy, worked to build a great steam line so blacks could partake in nation-building, and helped dispirited blacks dream of an eventual return to Africa. Garvey’s ability to realize his dreams was limited by his own organizational ineptitude and by the federal government’s systematic attempts to infiltrate and then destroy the UNIA. The lecture ends with an examination of Garvey’s relationships to other black leaders, including Father Divine and his Peace Mission Movement.","Let me begin with a quote by Marcus Garvey from his Declara–Declaration of Rights for the Negro Peoples of the World. Apparently while in London, he learned his lessons well. Garvey’s family had a background in typesetting and printing, and he gets his own training in publishing, and quickly produces a magazine or paper, called , a journal that serves as the mouthpiece for his nationalist philosophy of racial–race pride and race unity. In short order, when he moves his operation to New York City,  would have the second largest circulation of black periodicals in the country, second only to the So it’s sort of out of the blue, Garvey steps into the fray and becomes incredibly popular, as does his periodical. Garvey would claim, soon, up to six million followers. Now Garvey’s aware that there’s a growing desire for self determination by oppressed people around the world, especially after World War I. And Garvey, aside from just having these stores and these parades, marries this desire for self determination with a call for blacks to return to Africa and to build their own country. They would be the means for blacks to get to Africa. Garvey drastically overpaid for each of the three ships. The captain, as it turns out, was taking kickbacks. And the third ship blew a boiler on its maiden voyage and killed a man. We can’t forget Hoover through all of this. The first thing Hoover does is hire four black agents and assign them to infiltrate the UNIA. It’s really remarkable, the Garvey Papers, it’s a massive collection. A. Philip Randolph, a powerful labor leader that we’ll be talking about next week, referred to Garvey–whose, whose, who is powerful at this moment in time, referred to Garvey as, quote, “the supreme negro Jamaican jackass, or a monumental monkey, who is also an unquestionable fool, an ignoramus.” Do you want to save Africa for Africans or for blacks–black Americans?–to get at some of the answers, it’s useful to–helpful to plumb the depths of Garvey’s own publicly offered philosophies. Hence the pretentious work of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. And if this sounds a bit like the civilizationist rhetoric that I was talking about two weeks or so ago, you’re exactly right. And they can find a way to work together to get them out of each other’s hair. And this cultural exchange is where we’re going to pick up matters on Wednesday."
25,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-10,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock introduces the class to Hemingway’s novel , which originally appeared as a series of short stories in  and  magazines. She focuses on Hemingway’s designation of taxanomic groups (“types”) by race, class, and sexuality, arguing that Hemingway’s switch of narrative perspectives throughout the course of the novel casts every character, even protagonist Harry Morgan, as a classifiable kind of human being. In her treatment of types, she shows how Hemingway draws thematic parallels between seemingly disparate racial types, complicating the dualism of “to have” and “have not” that appears in the title.","This novel was written in a fairly haphazard fashion. We can think of those as in dialogue in really interesting ways. And we can see just how huge the marlin is. So it is in many ways the spring in Harry Morgan’s life. All of a sudden, we see Harry Morgan from the outside as if we knew nothing about him. We see it in the very title of the novel. As we can see and as you guys know, the story, the novel, is about a solitary Cuban fisherman, Santiago, and his decision to go out alone. Is he able to break away occasionally from that landscape? The other question– and that’s something that we’ve already seen in Faulkner, the play of pronouns, and that is highlighted, dramatized, by Hemingway’s choice of narrative technique– is whether he is an “I” or whether he is a “he. Just as in Faulkner, there’s an external view and not very pretty view of Dilsey in the fourth section of .And finally, going back to the title of the novel, whether he is a have or have-not. Toni Morrison, known primarily as an author of novels. ”Very, very strong objections to the novel. ”So we might object to the violence of the scene, but what is clear in this passage is the tremendous admiration that Hemingway has for this black character. We can attach any number of adjectives to Mr. Johnson. We can see right away that this is Hemingway’s way of both paying tribute to a generic type–in this case, a rich man– even his name is generic, Mr. Johnson. And this is actually the beginning of the bodily injuries sustained by Harry. It is not a great experience to be bitten by anyone, and this seems to be a very bad bite. I encourage you to talk about this issue in section. When he had been telling the story, he doesn’t refer to himself as Harry Morgan. Part two is in many ways a part of the story in which we see Harry as someone who should be reported to the authorities, someone who is the recipient of complaint, of ill will, of anger, of a grudge, at the very least, from Wesley, and who’s also someone that an outsider would want to report to the authorities. That is the tie between this black character and this white character. And here, this is a chapter that is told by Albert, the very marginal character. Losing one’s arm is quite different from losing lots of other things, to say the least. To what extent is the symmetry between Harry and Mr. Sing going to extend? Then after a minute, he says, ‘I got those other two still.’”"
26,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-11,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of  by showing how, in the context of the Cuban Revolutions and the Great Depression, characters devolve into those who “Have” and those who “Have Not.” While protagonist Harry Morgan may look like a political and economic “Have Not”–he neither supports the revolution nor possesses enough money to extract himself from its seedier operations–his ability to bring happiness to his wife Marie makes him a social “Have” in a more profound sense. Dimock casts Harry as a “mediated Have,” someone who, through the eyes of others, might be said to be in possession of something vital, denied to others with material and political satisfactions.","Let’s start by talking a little bit about the film. We realize that the film was very different from the book. There are passages and passages in which the old icy brilliance comes through with the slippery rhythm, the virtual assonance, the artful grade of phrases fused with such laborious cleverness that the click-clack of the beat is like a hiss … (but also) an unusual awkwardness, for this is a Hemingway who is rather less sure of himself than usual, but a good deal more intense. I would like to take that as a starting point to as whether or not  is a political novel. And he is channeled through Marie both because of the way she thinks about him, and also through the way he looks at her, and he is contrasted with Richard Gordon, contrasted with the way Richard looks at Marie, and contrasted with the way Richard Gordon talks to his own wife, Helen. We want to end slavery of the guajiros, you know, the peasants. He doesn’t have the second nature that is second nature to Emilio, and as a consequence, that’s how he talks:“I want a drink, Harry was thinking. What the hell do I care about his revolution, f-word his revolution. I think that Hemingway is not leaving a lot of doubt about that. So this is about the most acute case study of the Great Depression that we’ll get in American literature, except that Hemingway is not really talking about the Great Depression in a frontal way. All we know is that he had been law abiding for quite a while, as an owner of a charter boat, and now he’s doing something that is illegal because of the Great Depression. But he is not in a position to make any other choices at that point. So it’s at this moment, this is the absolute low point, I would say, for Harry. And now I want to go to a slightly different trajectory. What I like to suggest is actually the beginning of an outward trajectory. But the passage right here is a description, and I think that it maybe is a challenge from Hemingway– although I wouldn’t want to push this too much– a challenge to us to think about what it means to die, and what exactly do we have at the moment of death. So she’s had lots of men in her professional capacity. The contrast of that comes out in that previous passage. He has admirers, as we see, who are thrilled to meet him. This is when Marie knows that Harry is dead, and that was why her eyes are tear-reddened. ”What kind of a person Richard Gordon is can only be registered in the full by someone who is by his side all the time. I guess you find out, let you find out out how it feels to lose your husband. I’ve got a good thought if that’s what you have to do. Tremendous admiration for, Gertrude Stein. He really does sound like Gertrude Stein."
27,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-12,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock demonstrates how four of Fitzgerald’s most famous short stories–“The Rich Boy,” “Babylon Revisited,” “The Diamond as Big as the Ritz,” and “Bernice Bobs Her Hair”–represent “social types,” generic identities that Fitzgerald explores as forms of social reality.  She reads the dramatic tension in each of those stories as determined by the protagaonist’s conformity to or deviation from their idealized social type. ","I’m going to get started on the Fitzgerald stories. So it’s also in that story that he lays out his theory about fiction and especially the way that characters are to be described in fiction. Begin with a type, and you find that you have created– nothing. He’s turning a rich boy into a social type and generalizing about this entire social type. Let’s look at another kind of thinking about types. And as we can see from this very sober-looking, no-thrills, no-nonsense look of the treatise, this is a very highly respected sociological treatise by Burgess, E. W. Burgess, and RobertEzraParkcalled .And it turns out that social types, the notion of social types, is crucial to the birth of sociology. We need to be able to generalize from individual cases in order to create a system of classification. Now he’s going there because he doesn’t have anything else. From being a plus in his life– something that he has on his resume, that he’s such an important figure at the Yale Club– from being a plus on his resume, it becomes not exactly a minus, but a sign that things are just starting not to go well for him or that we’re beginning to see that some things are beginning to go wrong. There wasn’t much he could do now except send Honoria some things. And what is also interesting is it enables him to think about his wife, Helen, who died in very difficult circumstances when they were reconciled, but not really. There’s not going to be a dramatic change in his life. But neither of those stories, would I say, neither is really dramatic. And they were originally brought from the South, and they had always been in the possession of the family. It’s going to be contaminated by the living English language. We almost know that some catastrophe is going to happen at the end of the story. And if the word “flapper,” if that doesn’t ring a bell right away, this is an image of the very famous flappers of the 1920s, people who bobbed their hair and wear short skirts, show their legs, and so on. So cutting off somebody’s braids is not like the end of the world, as it is in “The Diamond as Big as the Ritz.” It goes all the way back to the nineteenth century, eighteenth century. And yes, when we look at human faces, there really are different human types, clearly undeniable. And here he is dressed up or not dressed up at all as a Native American and proving that, yes, a Caucasian can look like a Native American. And it turns out that Fitzgerald has actually prepared us for that development. So the language, of course, is mock-heroic. I can’t think of anybody more inventive or having more to bring to that kind of permutation."
28,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-13,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock begins her discussion of Faulkner’s  by orienting the novel to the Great Depression in the South, as focalized through such famous texts as . Once this macro history is established, she reads the narrative techniques of  through two analytic lenses. First, she draws on Bakhtin’s notion of social dialects to underscore the language that indexes poor whites as a Southern type. Second, she marshals Frank Kermode’s idea of narrative secrecy to show how two secrets in Dewey Dell’s illegitimate pregnancy and Jewel’s illegitimate birth–are gradually revealed to the reader through Faulkner’s multiple narrators, each a speaker of a socially codified dialect, and each a practitioner of narrative secrecy in his or her own right.  ","We’re going to get started on  and, as with , there’s a very long genealogy behind the title of the novel. But there’s a long story behind that, the reason that Clytemnestra–and I went to remember that name, because Clytemnestra will come up again in . And what generates those internal fractures is that there are multiple languages in the novel. ”We all know that novels actually do register passing fashions quite well. Although novels can also choose to be historic novels, in which case, they would be trying to mimic the language of the eighteenth century, or whatever, as Pynchon sometimes does, and is a master at doing that. And Kermode, basically, is interested in the Bible as his reading of the Gospel of St. Mark. Let’s think about how his idea could be incorporated or combined with Bakhtin’s theory of social dialects to think about the basic linguistic paradigm in .What I’d like to suggest is that we can very schematically classify speech in  under two headings. Obviously we need to keep in mind how poor whites would use the English language. Quite often we’re denied access to those meanings. So I saved out the eggs and baked yesterday. What we can say about this world is that this is a world in which moral responsibility is tightly encapsulated within the compass of the speaking voice. Miss Lawington is mentioned, is alluded to, but no blame is attached to her. And we can see one other instance of that. “ Riches is nothing in the face of the Lord, for He can see into the heart. ‘ One is very short term, and I think that you guys know what I’m talking about, Dewey Dell’s secret. And that’s why I can talk to him with knowing with hating because he knows. And we know exactly what it is that Darl knows, that Dewey Dell is going to town because she’s in such a condition that she desperately needs to do something about herself. surprising that she would hate Darl so much because of that. And it appears that he wants to throw stones at the rest of his family. And that Cash seems to be taking his time making the coffin, but not maliciously, we would think. We don’t know the long history, the long, emotional history behind all those people. They’re really basically all stuck in the same place. Dewey Dell is nothing like Caddy, but it’s almost as if Faulkner is showing us that, yes, he can certainly capture a young girl’s point of view, and maybe this is what comes out. The little bit of observation about Cash is interesting. This is one instance of language that is also completely incomprehensible to us, coming from a child, from Vardaman."
29,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-14,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock traces Faulkner’s appropriation of the epic genre through two conventions: the blurring of boundaries between humans and non-humans and the resurrection of the dead. She first reads Faulkner’s minor character Tull and his relation to both mules and buzzards to draw out the “nature of manhood in poor whites.” From Tull, she shifts focus to Jewel and suggests that his kinship with the snake and the horse foregrounds the narrative secrecy of Jewel’s genealogy. As Addie Bundren’s monologue reveals, Jewel’s illegitimate father, the Reverend Whitfield, is similarly identified with both the horse, as the animal he rides, and the snake, whose Edenic behavior he parallels in his affair with Addie. ","Just want to go back very briefly to the title of g. As you guys know, the title is taken from , Book XI. Just give you a couple more images of the cyclops. So he’s counting all his sheep as they go out, as they leave his cave, even though he can’t really see them. And I would say that this is actually one of the most important innovations in , in many ways more interesting than the epic journey itself, is that humans are rarely identified with just one kind of animal. So the two characters that I would like to talk about in that context is first of all Tull and then Jewel. It is counterintuitive to use minor characters as the main subject of your papers, but actually I promise you, especially in the case of Faulkner, you can get wonderful papers by focusing on someone like Tull or even someone like Cora, a very unobvious entry point. One is the mule, the indispensable animal among poor whites, the mule rather than the horse, and then a creature that also makes a routine appearance in Faulkner, the buzzard. That’s the function, that’s the epic function within , very much associated with a resigned but resilient attitude that we’ve seen in Tull, but in this case, the resignation and the personal bravery, that those two qualities aren’t really adequate to stopping the arrival of a catastrophe. ”A backward gesture to that earlier happy moment when the mules are fully contented and fully capable of doing what they can do within their own environment. And now them others, sitting there, like buzzards. ”We’ve talked about hatred as a very important emotion, as a kind of emotional bond within the family. Buzzards have already appeared in Faulkner. We simply see him as something that is in constant motion. It is a battle between two creatures very important to each other. So we don’t actually know what kind of emotional bonds can come from snakes, but it would seem to have at least some degree of hatred. And that really is what enables the bullfight to go on. We don’t really understand what’s going on. And this time it is a fully dramatized moment, in the sense that not only is the horse there and not only is Jewel there, but everyone else is there. It is completely by way of this detour around Jewel’s horse. We can say that from every single person–the overreaction of Addie, the crying, the sick-looking expression on Jewel’s face, the over-solicitude coming from Cash–all of those things are things that should not be in the script but surprisingly are in the script. This is the very early snake, the snake that is the bearer of knowledge coming to Adam and Eve that is being invoked here. While I waited for him in the woods, waiting for him because he saw me before he saw me, I would think of him as dressed in sin."
30,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-15,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of  with an analysis of its generic form. Using Nathaniel Hawthorne’s  to anchor her discussion of the American literary tradition, she argues that  continually negotiates the comic and the tragic genres as we shift from one perspective to another: one character’s comic gain is often another’s tragic loss. She traces the losses and gains of Cash, Jewel, and Darl throughout the novel, showing how their new “balances” by the end reconstitute the Bundren family and draw lines of kinship around the “haves” and “have nots” among family members.","I just want to go back very briefly to our approach to . Last time we talked about the importance of the epic tradition to the modernist novel, especially the way that the voice of the dead and certain boundaries between the human and the non-human are being reactivated and redeployed in .Today, we’re going to move on to a somewhat different approach. This is a different way to contextualize . The horse is able to cross the river when the mules drown. And it turns out that this predecessor is also a minister who has an affair with a woman. All the light and graceful foliage of her character had been withered up by this red-hot brand, and had long ago fallen away, leaving a bare and harsh outline which might have been repulsive, had she possessed friends or companions to be repelled by it. This is a kind of low point, absolute low point, the most tragic moment for Hester in .I want to turn now from Hester to the comparable figure in Faulkner’s . And we can almost sort of see why she would be so forlorn because the fact that he’s congratulating himself and because he’s counting himself lucky at the moment of her death suggests what kind of a lover he has been. And it comes out in statements like “my mother is a fish.” I think that along with “Call me Ishmael,” “My mother is a fish ” has got to be one of the most famous lines in American literature. ‘It is Cash and Jewel and Vardaman and Dewey Dell, ’ pa says, kind of hangdog and proud too, with his teeth and all, even as he wouldn’t look at it. ‘ But we just know that he’s going to qualify it in some fashion. That one person is no longer kin, no longer in that family. I just want to give you a couple of images why the gramophone would be such a desirable object, just like the telephone. ”In many ways, this is a zero sum game in  that one person gets a lot of stuff at the expense of someone else. If we’re floating the river unconscious, we can look like we’re inanimate matter, which is what Cash is at this moment. Or we can also think about different kind of a kinship that is snapping in place. He lies on the box with a quilt rolled under his head and a piece of wood under his knee. ‘ Vardaman is really rubbing it in that Cash has a broken leg. We talked about that last time that he’s caught between two poles. He’s both a horse, but also there’s something snake-like about his movement. And Jewel has not reacted in any fashion. This is a true turning point or a critical moment when things could have gone either way. And as a result of being blackened in this manner, then all of a sudden, they become brothers. Jewel who has previously been outside of that kinship circle has been admitted. But it is as a destroyer of Gillespie’s property that he will get sent to Jackson. So this is the beginning of the exclusion and the logic for that exclusion of Darl from that family circle."
31,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-16,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock begins her discussion of Hemingway’s  with an overview of the Spanish Civil War, the historical event at the heart of the novel. She introduces the notion of an “involuntary foreigner” to discuss the fate of Hemingway’s American protagonist Robert Jordan, as well as the Spanish guerillas who are turned into “aliens” within their own country due to their print and technological illiteracies. Professor Dimock concludes by connecting one’s status as an involuntary foreigner to the shape of the future, arguing that these characters have a tenuous claim to a Spain dominated by the Fascists, and to a modernity increasingly dominated by technology.","As is often the case with Hemingway, the title comes from a very well known classic, in this case John Donne’s poem, which is included in our edition of . If a clod be washed away by the sea,Europeis the less. Today, though, that wouldn’t be the focus. In this novel, Hemingway does not refer to the Nationalists as the Nationalists. Here is another picture by Robert Capa, again 1936, at the very beginning of the war. It was a very important link between the First World War and the Second World War. And we know that the alliances in the Spanish Civil War, Germany and Italy, would go on to become the Axis Powers in the Second World War– so an important link between those two great world wars. But the Americans were there in full force, and this is the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. It quickly stopping being fun, as we can tell from the novel. He was covering the war with the Republicans here and this rare image of him actually holding a gun. Going back to Donne, but also going back to pretty much all the text that we’ve been talking about all semester – we’ve been talking about this phenomenon of involuntary association in terms of individual and type – I just want to go back very quickly, to refresh your memory. Lots and lots of people are involuntary foreigners in their own country. In any case, it makes us aware of how English actually is not translatable word for word into the Spanish. ’”The Spanish “G” and “J” sounds are pronounced as H. So that’s why it’s especially disconcerting when you have the combination of those, as in Comrade General Golz. There’s just no sound that will reproduce a necessary sound in English. Would there be a functional slot for him in that community? He has a very, very well-defined function. And so we don’t know if this forecast will actually become reality. We don’t actually see a lot of Americans. And actually Robert Jordan is also quite aggressive in making sure that the Spanish can sometimes feel like they don’t quite own their own country. That’s why Pablo’s very sullen, angry response – a completely understandable response– is “No one commands here but me. ”Pablo’s hope—and it is a very interesting hope, that will be tested, and I think to some degree supported in the novel – is that it doesn’t really matter how high up you are on the general military infrastructure. I’m just saying this now as a possibility. In the context of the Spanish Civil War, people who have never seen the Lewis gun, have never handled one, have a different relation to the future. Here is the Italian Fiat and Anselmo is to be forgiven for mistaking the Italian Fiat for the Boeing P32, because actually they are short, and they are kind of clumsy looking. I just want to give you two final images of what happens to the Spanish historically because of the use of bombers in the Spanish Civil War. It just has no relation to reality as you know it."
32,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-17,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock continues her discussion of  by analyzing the contrast Robert Jordan draws between “distant homes” and the on-site environment of the Spanish Civil War. She juxtaposes his invocations of Paris and Missouri to the rooted communities of the guerillas, and reads analogies of racial and ethnic conflict–specifically, the references to the Moors in Spain and persecuted blacks in America–as a point of tension, an ironic commentary on the coexistence of the distant home and the on-site environment. She concludes with a reading of the American Civil War as a temporally distant home which Jordan tries to recuperate in the present moment of European conflict.","We’re going to move on now and follow up on what we talked about last time, which is the sevenfold permutation. He said that he could actually write about Michigan best when he was in Paris. It’s supposed to rot your brain out but I don’t believe it. A lot of this, just like the print illiteracy that he comes upon, that he just discovers without meaning to, this is his actively highlighting the fact that he is much more a man of the world than they are, and there’s no competition. Then we’ll be Mr. and Mrs. Robert Jordan of Sun Valley, Idaho. But that’s just my way of not being too attached, showing some critical distance. So the first part of that is just the kinds of the typical professional irony towards something that you really actually do want to go back to and have some yearning for. So we’re made aware, ahead of time, that Maria was once raped. The gypsies believe the bear to be a brother of man.’ ‘ So also believe the Indians in America,’ Robert Jordan said. ‘ But I have seen much of them and clearly, since the movement, more. It’s that the gypsies are just like the Moors. Once again, the kind of a spilling over, thinking about Native Americans with their own very uneasy history in the United States. And, even to us, the reference to the lynching might seem out of the blue while reading right now. Even though the actual number of lynching had declined at that point. It was highlighted, it was brought to the public consciousness for a number of reasons. Strange fruit hanging from the tops of the trees. So this is a kind of very famous double lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith inIndianain 1930. And it’s because of these very sensational lynchings in the North that the NAACP actually had this regular practice of just hanging out a flag in theNew York Cityoffice announcing that a man was lynched yesterday. We can’t even say that– it would be reassuring to say that it’s just cultural ignorance or the impossibility of cross-cultural understanding that is resulting in the responses from Maria and Pilar. It would be reassuring to be able just to say, it’s because they don’t know anything about theUnited States. The response is never the right response. For a good part of that passage, it is a comedy of cross-cultural error. Just not being able to wrap your mind around the fact that to be a Republican in the United States is a very different thing than being a Republican in Spain. And so those are impossible homes for him at this point."
33,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-18,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock focuses on the themes of dying and not dying that reappear throughout . Marshaling Elaine Scarry’s argument on the aesthetics of killing, she reads the execution of the Fascists as a representation of both aesthetic and ethical “ugliness” in death. She then turns to a discussion of the tragic-comic dimensions of not dying as depicted in the bullfighter Finito’s refusal to die and the smell of death emanating from the old women in the Madrid marketplace. She concludes with a reading of the word –coward–as it is applied to both Robert Jordan’s suicidal father and the indomitable Pablo.","I just want to refresh your memory about some of the things that we’ve been saying about . The other home is a more complicated place in the sense that maybe it’s not even a geographical locale, but a kind of emotional shelter that is given to him– bestowed upon him – by his grandfather’s heroic conduct in the civil war. And he needs that very much because of the non-home that is the twentieth century. We’ll see this tableau repeated by another person in an equally traumatic moment. But here, it seems that Robert really has no parent. And here, the biography of Hemingway really becomes quite important. Hemingway’s own father, Dr. Clarence Hemingway, died by his own hand. Clearly, Hemingway’s talking about something that’s also recognized by other people as, in many ways, the utopian moment of the war when violence is both executed, but not allowed to get out of hand. Drunk with your own sense of momentary power, absolute power over someone. That the sense of proportion, the sense of balance, the sense of symmetry, all those ideas that we associate with beauty should also be concepts that we consider when we think about crime and punishment. That there’s that kind of balance and symmetry. And there was no sound but the splashing of the water in the fountain and I sat there and I thought we have begun badly.” But I think that she has a lot of authority. Even though it’s a dead bull, it doesn’t matter. If this were a mirror image, it ought to have been Finito in his prime of life, when he was a great matador, when he wouldn’t be coughing blood, when he would be able to eat instead of now when he can’t eat anything, because of the damage that has been done to this stomach. This is Pilar talking to Robert about the smell of death. But for Hemingway, it seems to be a kind of a reproach on the old women that they should have this growth on their faces. But the way that this moment of bombing is described three times in this passage is that the earth is rising up and hitting the guerilla band, and every one of them gets killed in this bombing. The Spanish peasants, they live on the earth, they think that the earth is on their side. to have the earth suddenly joining the side of the enemy is about the worst thing that could happen. It was a thing I cannot tell thee…’ ‘For you, Ingles?’ So he’s suddenly hoping for the best, which is that his father would just disappear and that one link would be invalid. Maybe it’s easier just to ease your way into that way of thinking about your father. Because so much goes on inside his head and also through him that we actually don’t see represented in the novel."
34,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-19,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of by reading the novel as a narrative of dispossession and repossession. She argues that the rape of Maria, which takes place in front of a barbershop mirror, enacts one type of disempowerment; the end of Robert Jordan’s life represents another, but with the potential for redemption. She shows how Jordan vacillates between a “have” and a “have not,” depending on how ironically one understands Maria’s question “What hast thou?”","This is the historic end of the Spanish Civil War. Partly it had to do with the fact that the women were so important in the Spanish Civil War as soldiers. Today we’ll be looking at more instances of those kinds of symmetry. Possession and dispossession, have and have not– a paradigm that we’ve been looking at for some time – along with ironic and not ironic. Execution that we saw, the execution of the fascists that we saw last time in Chapter 10. Even though it’s the women who are getting raped, it  is a metaphor for what happens to the losers in the war. But my grief was so great that I had no fear nor any feeling but my grief. But Maria doesn’t talk about the actual rape. In this case, Maria looking at herself in the mirror as the rape is about to happen is the beginning of the trauma. The people who are doing the torturing see only the object of the torture. This process of not recognizing herself would get dramatized in a way that goes back, actually, to the image of the two lines that we had talked about, and that Robert Motherwell also represented in numerous paintings. This is very much the same logic as the earth rising up and hitting the men that it has been nourishing up to this point. “Then the one who had gagged me ran a clipper all over my head; first from the forehead all the way to the back of the neck and then across the top and then all over my head and close behind my ears and they held me so I could see into the glass of the barber’s mirror all the time that they did this and I could not believe it as I saw it done and I cried and cried but I could not look away from the horror that my face made with the mouth open and the braids tied in it and my head coming naked under the clippers.” Hair might not be the most powerful form of shelter, but it is a form of shelter in the sense that without it we really look very naked, naked in a psychological sense. She should always be a subject to herself, in a sense that she would never actually see herself as she’s seeing herself right now. In the case of Maria, because it is strictly a mirror effect, and because it is a strictly visual tableau, and because her mouth is gagged, it is completely soundless. The two opposing arguments: one would be that  is a narrative about dispossession, that what Robert ends up with at the end of the novel is as a “have not.” The other, and I like to end with that, is to argue that it actually is a narrative of repossession. Here, too, the structure is very much similar to the alienating device in .I’ve done everything that I can to make a case for  as a novel of dispossession. He’s lost even a novel that is supposedly his. It is just that most people are not lucky enough ever to have it. They will continue to tell you that you didn’t. It takes some real power to convince himself that he did have it. But Hemingway actually has stepped in and provided one form of authority or intervention that allows us, possibly, to read the novel as affirming something about Robert, so that he’s not totally a loser at the end of the novel."
35,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-1,"Professor Dimock introduces the class to the works of Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and William Faulkner, the premiere writers of American modernism. She orients their novels along three “scales” of interpretation: global geopolitics, experimental narration, and sensory detail. Invoking the writings of critic Paul Fussell, she argues that all three writers are united by a preoccupation with World War I and the implications that the Great War has for irony in narrative representation.","And let me just explain a couple of mechanics about this class. So this is one level at which we can understand Hemingway, is that he really was a player in a very large-scale map of the world. A young white girl is seen in intimate parallel with a young black boy who’s Luster, the black servant who’s taking care of Benjy. But I think that Benjy especially does that. And we’ll be talking about war today, talk about war generally, as the most obvious level, which is large-scale geopolitics. What does it mean to live without any kind of hope for yourself or for the outcomes of war? This is a lifelong habit for Hemingway, and here we in some sense see the origins of that way of writing, very clean, very economical. Usually being blurry is not a narrative advantage, but it could be that under some circumstances, blurriness is actually a cultivated effect and is designed to do something. Both the Turks and the Greeks were equally reprehensible. And I’ll be reading you two passages by Hemingway to think about what irony means for Hemingway. And what’s frustrating about Ataturk to the religious side, Islamic side, is that he turns out not to be a fanatic at all. All he is saying is that this is a war that is driven by economic rationality. This is one side of irony: that things are not lining up. This is really, I think, what Paul Fussell means by saying that there’s really an abridgement of hope in a war like this is that we can’t really go and fight for the Greeks because they are victims of the Turkish aggressors. It is a very, very desolate landscape, emotional as well as moral landscape. Use our ears to listen to Hemingway as we read his words on the page. So he actually does write about World War I, but for the most part he’s not known as someone who writes about World War I. And instead, we can say that there’re shadows of World War I in all his writings about the American Civil War, which is obviously what is appropriate to Faulkner to write about. I think that it’s interesting that Hemingway would not be capable of writing anything like this – even about the Civil War – though he’s idealistic about the Civil War, as well. is a novel that we won’t be reading, but it’s a great novel, so I encourage you to read this on your own if you have a chance after this class. Usually, being interchangeable is not really a good thing for us. And what seems a tragedy on one level can turn into a kind of a comedy of sorts."
36,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-20,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock positions her reading of  alongside F. Scott Fitzgerald’s career as a Hollywood screenwriter. She shows how the novel borrows narrative techniques from film, particularly flashback, “switchability” on a macro and micro scale, and montage. Invoking the theories of Sergei Eisenstein, she reads scenes of wartime death and individual murder to show how love and war are cross-mapped, superimposed onto one another as part of the narrative fabric of . ","Here is Fitzgerald – reciting “Ode to a Nightingale.” What is in the Keats poem that is, once again, is a tolling of a bell, tolling your form self back to you. The novel was supposedly attributed to them. That’s an almost intrinsic question in the way that they were thought of as the golden couple. Here is another book about Fitzgerald in Hollywood. So it is really a very organic part of his career. A grammatical relation, a kind of reversibility of grammatical relation. What effect is achieved by having a narrative that is out of sequence?Today I wanted to concentrate, because we haven’t read so far into the novel, I wanted to concentrate on switchability or reversibility as a relatively small scale phenomenon. Before it was pearls hanging around her neck. This is the persistent question: whether the money is more important than human beings, or vice versa. Once again, this is more than – in fact, more than just a mini narrative, but a kind of global vision of the world, a vision of the relation in between humanity and economy is suggested by the very, very micro detail of the reversible relation between “back” and “pearls.” It’s really the speech pattern and the tone of voice of someone who’s never not been on the top of the world, as she looks down on everyone, and just putting them in the places. But as is the case with Fitzgerald, the word “hard” is not allowed to stand alone, because we can’t forget that in fact, there were three adjectives, “hard,” and “lovely” and “pitiful.” One thing comes after another, the structure of time. So this is a conversation between Rosemary and Tommy Barban who’s a mercenary. You like the Divers,’ she reminded him. ‘ So we have no understanding of what context Tommy Barban is speaking. Right there, this is a snake making its way into this paradise that is the French Riviera. She didn’t know what to do – she wanted to talk to her mother. It’s always mapped against large-scale warfare. In fact, I would also say that this is another one of those mysteries that even at the end of the novel, we might not be able to say exactly what the logic is. And that’s because in his mind there is such a tight knit between love and war that you almost cannot talk about one without talking about the other. But according to this analysis of war, it is middle-class romantic love that is at the back of war. That’s the most usual context for the little running, except it was a dodging little run. Instead, it seems simply to be a meditation on the way the world comes to us refracted, and there are multiple objects to be doing that, and the relation between that and our subconscious, and the relation between that and our memory."
37,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-21,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of  with a biographical sketch of Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald’s mental instability, the inspiration for the character of Nicole Diver. Invoking the schema of “have” and “have not,” she then shows how Fitzgerald borrows techniques from film to quicken the pace of Dick Diver’s narrative of dispossession. Dimock argues that Fitzgerald uses close-up, cross-cutting, and the speeding up of negative resolutions to strip Dick of his professional identity and to render him empty-handed at the end.","I’m coming to Leslie’s section and Merve’s section today. But Nicole refers to him as Captain Diver. This is the picture of her release from Prangins. Even though, obviously, he was the one who was the writer. And I think this is generally thought that this is the person that Rosemary is based on. But she also was tremendously disciplined as an actress. She looked up Geneva in an atlas and found it was in the heart of the Finger Lakes Section and considered a pleasant place. Perhaps, so she liked to think, his career was biding its time, again like Grant’s in Galena; his latest note was post-marked from Hornell, New York, which is some distance from Geneva and a very small town; in any case he is almost certainly in that section of the country, in one town or another. We’ve seen this structure before, and I promise you we’ll see it one more time. All he has is a broken leg, that very ironic reading, which is not to be dismissed. It’s almost as if we’re beginning all over again. We know that the novel is moving very fast. Then we have the very fast motion of the negative resolutions. Let’s look at a couple of instances of close-up. So it’s not surprising that she should know herself to be primarily an actress. But there’s a switch, abrupt switch, to a different sequence of narrative. But he is going to give us echoes of World War I in civilian situations. We can say that what the close-up is doing for Fitzgerald– especially the woman’s face getting bigger and bigger– is the dramatization, the visualization of the woman’s power over the man. When Rosemary’s face is getting so big that she fills the entire visual tableau, that is the point where we see that Rosemary actually knows exactly what kind of a man Dick Diver is. This is outside of her exchange of the letters that she writes to Dick Diver. I’ll have to feel bloated for us both….”I’m not even reading it very well. This is, in many ways, an early paving of the ground for the eventual outcome of the novel that is highlighted by Nicole presenting herself as the victimized party in the marriage. If he had done things right, he would have had absolute control of the marriage before he loses out in the department of knowledge. But now that he’s lost out in the department of knowledge, he’s not going to have power in that marriage as well. It is somebody else’s speed that has dictated the narrative development. I know that we’re almost running out of time, so I’ll give you the final part of that resolution against in fast motion. I was just saying this is a great moment to pair up with the barber scene, the rape scene in .“The mirror in front of Nicole reflected the passage between the men’s side and the women’s, and Nicole started up at the sight of Tommy, Bob and the man she’s going to marry entering and wheeling sharply in the men’s shop. Your friend has worked himself up into a state."
38,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-22,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock focuses her introductory lecture on Faulkner’s on the “pagan quality” of his protagonist Lena. She argues that Faulkner uses Lena to update the classic story of the unwed mother by fusing comedy with the epic road novel. In doing so, he also updates the Greek tradition of the kindness of strangers, drawing attention to it through certain stylistic markers, including the “switchability” between the protagonist and her supporting cast, the use of gerunds as a linguistic safe haven for Lena, and the allegorical naming of Byron and Burden as social types with scripted trajectories.","There’s so many stories to tell about Faulkner, just about the composition of the novel. Maybe the connection is with Lena Grove, who has something of that pagan quality. You see basically it’s like human beings, except, the feet are the hooves of a goat. The satyr actually has an even long history. Here is someone with the ears of a satyr. And another innovation that Faulkner is bringing to bear on the novel– and that really is a serious updating of the classic epic comedy– is the introduction of two allegorical names, Byron and Burden. It has to do with villainous people, but not going all the way to full villainy. With that definition in mind, let’s think about the ways in whichLenais pagan, especially in relation to her sexuality, and way that Faulkner represents this aspect of the human condition. ”The entire story what could have been seen as tragic, traumatic, devastating in person’s life, one whose life’s been ruined, all that is told through Lena’s relation to the window, that she can open it without making a noise, that’s she’s done it a few times, and then she realized she shouldn’t have done it, and then the final time it’s very hard. Delicate equilibrium of periodic filth between two moons balanced. So that at last, as though out of some trivial and unimportant region beyond even distance, the sound of it seems to come slow and terrific and without meaning, as though it were a ghost traveling a half mile ahead of its own shape. It is just an old story being told over and over again and the complete exclusion of anything that is dramatic from this sense of the journey. It turns out that actually even though the protagonist herself too is peaceful for this story to be very dramatic, there will be other people, the supporting cast actually, who supplies the drama. I don’t know of anybody by that name around here. That for me is a measure of how good the marriage is, that you know your companion that well. I know there’s actually that– when I came to this sections last week and I enjoyed them very much, some of you mentioned that Nicole is financially more like a man and so is Rosemary. From the bed, reclining, Armstid watches her gather the remaining coins from among the china fragments and drop them with the others into the sack and knot it and reknot it three or four times with savage finality. And because we’ve just done with Fitzgerald, I want to remind you of a similar instance of switchability in , in the description of Nicole, that her brown back is hanging from the pearls. Basically on a very large macro scale, in terms of the entire narrative structure of . And so there will be two within his seeing before his remembering. It happens on a Saturday afternoon while he’s alone at the mill. It starts out with Byron falling in love, but that romantic side of this story doesn’t even get to control the entire paragraph. Then the rest of the paragraph is taken over by something that has nothing to do with romantic love. All of a sudden we realize that yes, Byron is falling in love at the same time as another unfolding event. These are not the strangers who are kind to other strangers. The allegorical names – how they function in , and how Faulkner’s really updating the old classic story – the story is about the fate of someone called Byron and the fate of someone called Burden."
39,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-23,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock continues her discussion of  by showing how the kindness of strangers turns into malice in the cases of social reformer Joanna Burden and Reverend Hightower. Whereas that malice assumes comedic tones in the depiction of Joanna’s death, it has more complex valences in the case of Reverend Hightower, who is both ethically delicate towards his neighbors and insensitive to his adulterous wife.  Professor Dimock concludes by observing the kinship between the dual narratives of Lena Grove and Joe Christmas as, respectively, the undramatic and dramatic strands of the novel. Drawing on her reading from last lecture, she shows how both Joe and Lena’s consciousness is marked by the gerund form and a passivity of agency that makes them receptacles for the dramatic actions of others.","I’ll be coming to Tao’s section today, but I actually have to teach a class at the same time, so I’ll be a little late coming to your section, I’ll be there at about 1:45. And also the idea of community – thinking about Lena’s relation to the Southern community, Southern hospitality as an updating of the ancient Greek idea of hospitality to strangers. This is one image of how doing good, or the claim to do good, can actually benefit yourself. And he said that what he was scared of happened. And of course, in Dante’s cosmos, this quite severe Christian cosmos, unlike the Greek tradition, human beings are not really supposed to know anything about the future. There’s a kind of a thematic connection, but the tonal connection is different. These two are very important variations to the customary story about Klan violence. It was as though the town realized at last that he would be a part of its life until he died, and that they might as well become reconciled. I would say that this is– I don’t know, I mean, maybe this is too utopian, I’m just reporting to you – but this is what I think Faulkner is doing. And I think it’s because of this – because this is violence within limits. It’s that you can’t really change what people believe about you. And hatred is a very powerful reality for Faulkner. That is the ethical challenge for Hightower. One is that he seems complete fixated on the Civil War. But he was not, and the neighbors would hear her weeping in the parsonage in the afternoons or late at night, and the neighbors knowing that the husband would not know what to do about it because he did not know what was wrong. Hightower is trying to deliver a black baby. Today, we’ll look at part of what he’s trying to do, I think, and look at the contrasting functions of Lena Grove and Joe Christmas in this novel. All the good things about the community come out when we see Lena Grove in action. ”Just to have the name Christmas– and I can’t really think of a name that is less neutral, less innocuous than the name Christmas – even for us,  to hear someone called Christmas, there will be a kind of strange response from most of us. The rest of the story really plays on the consequences, in many ways, of having a name like Christmas. I hope that it makes no sense to you – why Faulkner would want to use this peaceful description for Joe Christmas right before the moment of violence. I will be riding within the hearing of Lucas Burch before his seeing. He didn’t think even then, Something is going to happen. So even the most dramatic action that he’s responsible for is cast as something that is happening to him, almost without his volition. He was looking straight ahead, with a rapt, calm expression like a monk in a picture."
40,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-24,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock focuses on the unresolved problem of race in , focusing her discussion on the variety of reflexive and calculated uses of the word “nigger” as a charged term toward Joe Christmas. She shows how the semantic burden of the word varies – used under duress by Joe Brown and the dietician, deliberately made light of by Hightower and Bobbie, fused with the contrary meanings of Calvinist theology by Joanna Burden, and finally ironized by Joe Christmas himself. Dimock uses these multiple uses of the word “nigger” to meditate on the making of racial identities and our collective input into that process..","I just want to remind you, refresh your memory about what we were talking about before the break. But Hightower, as we also know, is emphatic that – in spite of what happens to him, in spite of the beatings and so on – that he’s actually surrounded by good people. I look at everyone, yeah, quite often I can’t really tell what background, ethnic background people are from. And also when the word is spoken by the person himself. First, let’s look at the way Joe Brown uses that word. So this is one kind of self-contained usage of shameful, and shameful even to the person who is doing it. And this is what Joe sees when she drags him out. This is the thing that you fling at people. He seemed to see ranked tubes of toothpaste like corded wood, endless and terrifying; his whole being coiled in a rich and passionate revulsion. ‘ You nigger bastard!’”This is the evolution of the dietitian, she’s not so vulnerable now. Joe Christmas is really interesting in that way. First, complete vulnerability on the part of the dietitian. Sometimes I think the children have a way of knowing things that grown people of your and my age don’t see. Here, on the other side of the spectrum, is someone who simply cannot have that distance from that word. “His face is at once gaunt at flabby; it is as though there were two faces, one imposed upon the other, looking out from beneath the pale, bald skull surrounded by a fringe of gray hair, from behind the twin motionless glare of his spectacles. His eyes were closed, his hand slow and unceasing. ‘ He doesn’t stop when he makes that confession. Every individual effort to lighten or trivialize that epithet, every attempt to make light of that word  is going to fail. This is the account that Joanna would give of the reason why the two of them are killed. Even though it seems like a strange kind of logic, once you spell it out in that way, actually it is a strange, but nonetheless truthful statement. It’s predicated on the notion, and in some sense, it’s a summary of all that we’ve seen so far, which is that the racial epithet is in fact an epithet that all of us reach for involuntarily when we are under duress. I wouldn’t say that he’s a Calvinist, but he’s certainly very, very interested in this kind of thinking, a curse that is transmitted across time, across generations. We see Addie’s illegitimate son Jewel in . So this is the pendulum swing of Joanna from that incredible sexual license to the other side. But then you also engage in this uncontrollable sexual orgy with them."
41,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-25,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of  and the semester by mapping Faulkner’s theology of Calvinist predestination onto race. Using Nella Larsen’s novel  as an intertext, she shows how Joe Christmas’s decision to self-blacken expresses his tragic sense of being predestined, of always “coming second.” Moving away from tragedy, Dimock reads Hightower’s delivery of Lena’s baby as inhabiting a liminal space between tragedy and comedy, as Faulkner gives Hightower a second chance at meaningful communal agency.  She finishes by reading Lena Grove and Byron Bunch’s courtship as the comic end of .","Last time, on Tuesday, we were talking about the use of the word “nigger” by various people– sometimes trying to be trivializing, sometimes obviously agonized but trying to disguise that fact. Today, we’re turning to the other side of the phenomenon and thinking about what it means to inhabit that adjective, “nigger”– what it means to embrace that as one’s identity. To understand this, I think we need to borrow the terminology from someone who talks about what he calls double-consciousness. Today, I’d like to talk about this kind of redoubled double-consciousness in Faulkner along three lines of inquiry. One:  the importance of the light and shadow, which is epitomized, dramatized in the title. This is George Wilson at the moment when he’s starting out on his quest to kill the killer, the person who he thinks kills his wife, and pointing to this God on the billboard as the authority, invoking that authority to justify the mission that he’s just beginning. The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He becomes an involuntary, strictly passive recipient of sounds that come to him. To those whom He devotes to condemnation, the gate of life is closed by a just irreprehensible, but incomprehensible judgement. But at the same time, if you’re a Calvinist you also have to believe that is irreprehensible. It’s not Joe Christmas who’s doing the walking. This is the outcome of that particular relationship that is completely under the shadow of race. If we were to give primacy to that section, then the symmetry of weapons– the razor and the pistol, both chambers loaded in Joanna’s pistol, she really means for the two of them to die together – is the appropriate end for a tragic narrative. with his hands raised and clenched, his face sweating, his lip lifted upon his clenched and rotting teeth from about which the long sagging of flabby and puttycolored flesh falls away. But that is a moment when his voice is very high as befitting his name, Hightower. So Faulkner, I would say, is quite gentle towards Hightower in terms of the final place given to him in the story, in the novel. And again the two men, both older now, met a door of a one-room cabin, the professional having lost again to the amateur, for as he entered the door, the doctor heard the infant cry. But that’s not the only meaning of “too” or in the variation, “also.” That is why, to my mind, Hightower is such an important midpoint between Joe Christmas and Lena Grove. But it is important to recognize that is a completely accidental development. There’s no reason, no logical reason why the doctor should arrive too late. Just that the halo is not the halo around a single face. That’s the reason why Faulkner can go right back to how he begins – to the kindness of strangers. This kindness of strangers is not even ironized by everything that has happened in between page one of  and the final pages."
42,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-2,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock discusses Hemingway’s first book , a collection of vignettes published in 1925 that launched Hemingway’s career as a leading American modernist. Professor Dimock examines a cluster of three vignettes from  to show how Hemingway’s laconic style naturalizes problems of pain and violence amidst the ethnic tensions of the American Midwest. Drawing on the theoretical writings of critics Elaine Scarry and Susan Sontag, and the artistic representations of painter Edvard Munch, Professor Dimock shows how language probes the empathetic boundaries of communal suffering in “Indian Camp” and “Chapter II.” She concludes with a discussion of “The Doctor and the Doctor’s Wife” that shows how inter-ethnic conflict between Native Americans and whites is neutralized by the primitive impulse of peacekeeping, the opposite of the violence she reads in the two other vignettes in this cluster. ","And , as we’ll find out, many of the titles of the novels are actually from very canonical works, or very ancient works in the case of Faulkner. It doesn’t look like a short story collection. It doesn’t work as a linear, streamline kind of narrative. But because Hemingway is so emphatic about it, let’s just do this little experiment of reading these three–two stories and then one inter-chapter–as if they all belong together as a unit. But, even given that it was initially published in , let’s still group it with the other two – “Chapter II” and then “The Doctor and the Doctor’s Wife.” And you might or might not have read these people, but they are very influential figures, including obviously a great painter writing about pain and injury and so on. What she argues is that there’s a breakdown of language under extreme conditions of pain. This is one end of the spectrum in thinking about pain. And it’s really about pain as a sound, pain coming out as a scream. We see other people suffering and we get some visual pleasure. And I think most people would agree that we can shut our eyes. She can’t help causing pain to her own community. So this is one possible outcome, is that it’s basically a kind of neutralization of the scream. The inter-chapters, at least this particular one, is obviously written as a continuation of a meditation on the pain of childbirth. All of a sudden this detail about it raining–the only connection that I can think of, and it’s a conjecture on my part, is that Hemingway has so far been talking about human phenomena. Rain is truly a natural phenomenon that is without human input, without human agency. So it’s very much a concession in the direction of the naturalness of pain and the unavoidable intensity, and the unavoidable violence that they can do to other people. And this is actually what I like to say as the first step towards the end of the story which we know is actually a happy ending. Dick picked up the axes and Eddy took the saw down from the tree. I can’t offer you an explanation why that particular detail is in there. The doctor stood up and put the shotgun in the corner behind the dresser. ‘ If you see Nick, dear, will you tell him his mother wants to see him?’ And the other thing that she says is if you see Nick, tell him that I want to see him, and he should come in to see me. And we can’t think of a better companion, a better tool for the mother to use to stop the doctor from getting into a fight with his Native American workers."
43,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-3,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock continues her discussion of Hemingway’s , testing four additional clusters of chapters and vignettes. She offers readings of each cluster that focus on Hemingway’s logics of expressivity, substitution, and emotional resilience. She concludes that Hemingway mixes tragedy and comedy as genres of writing to produce a humor that vacillates between irony and farce.","Just want to go back very briefly to Hemingway’s letter to John Dos Passos just to remind us what we are up against, this claim on Hemingway’s part. “ And here’s another important letter to Edmund Wilson. This is especially important when a soldier is coming back home: what happened during the war, versus what happened after the war. And going along with that, is the intensity of the experience when you’re in the war, versus, as we know from the story “Soldier’s Home,” the staleness of it when you come back. Even when we’re devastated by something, whether or not that sense of devastation will be with us, even a short moment afterwards. And it’s almost the kind of a slightly larger view, moving away from the bacon fat on the plate to the larger family situation. “As you will see I have revised the Mr. and Mrs. Elliot story and entirely eliminated the obscene image. In the evening they all sat at dinner together in the garden under a plane tree and the hot evening wind blew and Elliot drank white wine and Mrs. Elliot and the girl friend made conversation and they were all quite happy. It’s the lesbian relationship that actually stops this from being a tragedy. The bull, by the time he comes out, is weakened already by various people stabbing at him. And here are two images of that kind of substitution, shameless use of the horse as a shield against the bull. But it really is thinking, generally and abstractly, about what counts as a good life, or what counts as being a good player in a bullfight. Because I don’t think it’s actually the same cat. But the more important substitution in the story, other than just wanting the cat to stand for something else, is also that instead of the husband being the emotional support for the wife, it is the hotel apparatus that has substituted, has stepped in and is fulfilling that function. But I think that Hemingway, actually, is a slightly different kind of writer. So he is quite unashamed of going to an almost embarrassing extreme in a sense that you don’t want to show that this is really what you believe in. But this time it’s not the picador on his horse. Villalta became one with the bull and then it was over. But for Hemingway, this kind of complete lack of emotional insulation – and we’ve talked about the question of insulation in Indian Camp – but the complete lack of emotional insulation between yourself and something that you feel utterly passionate about: that for Hemingway, is the place that he really wants to get to. I have to say I like the “Big Two-Hearted River” much more than the bull fighting scenes in Hemingway. But he is on this trip through a country that is not really disclosed to us. A landscape we don’t really know where it is. And this is what happens at the moment when Nick catches his trout. And it has to do, actually, with similar dynamics to the bull fighting. So, as far as I can see, Hemingway is actually a very affirmative writer at the end  in the sense that he’s also revising his own story. So, say goodbye to Hemingway, we move on to Fitzgerald and  on Tuesday."
44,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-4,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock begins her discussion of by highlighting Fitzgerald’s experimental counter-realism, a quality that his editor Maxwell Perkins referred to as “vagueness.” She argues that his counter-realism comes from his animation of inanimate objects, giving human dimensions of motion and emotion to things as varied as lawns, ashes, juicers, telephones, and automobiles.  She concludes with a short meditation on race in  and encourages a closer reading of the novel’s instances of racial differentiation.","I’m sure that you guys have your own views on the novel. I would say that he really is the muse of the 1920s. Now everything about Gatsby is more or less a mystery, i.e., more or less vague, and this may be somewhat of an artistic intention, but I think it is mistaken. Couldn’t he be physically described as distinctly as the others, and couldn’t you add one or two characteristics like the use of that phrase ‘old sport,’ not verbal, but physical ones, perhaps?”Very upfront about what he likes, and in this case, what he doesn’t like. My first instinct after your letter was to let him go and have Tom Buchanan dominate the book. He would have been totally flabbergasted. So I think that we can see several things from this exchange. And I’d like to tease out some of the attributes or manifestations of the counter-realist mode of writing. Occasionally, a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight. Quite often, it’s like a camera that is moving, this blurry image. And the landscape itself suggest that the desolation is never really absent from that household. We don’t know what he looks like, but we know for sure he doesn’t look like one of those machines. And I have to say, it is an open question:  some of us actually are more stimulated by the visual medium than by the linguistic medium. So we don’t know what Gatsby is like, other than that he is someone who seems to be able to work with great distances, registering an earthquake 10,000 miles away. This is comedy both as it comes to us but also comedy in the act of composition. It is an emotional cord that really binds one person. Somebody should write a paper about this, beginning with the reference to .There’s a persistent undercurrent of blackness, actually, in this novel, just as there is also an  undercurrent of Germanism – Gatsby is supposed to be in the pay of the German army. So here’s the automobile – the 1920s Rolls-Royce. And this is, in fact, the stuff that modern mythology is made of. We don’t know what vegetation is in that conservatory. We’ll never see that limousine driven by the white chauffeur with the two black men and a young black woman sitting in that car. And Gatsby is related to Myrtle in that way. And in this passage, the second mention of the car, it actually is a real hearse, not in the sense that there’s a dead body in it, but in the sense that it’s the carrier of death, it’s the bringer, conveyor, of death to Myrtle."
45,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-5,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of  by evaluating the cross-mapping of the auditory and visual fields in the novel’s main pairs of characters. Beginning with an analysis of the Jazz Age, she argues that linkages between what is heard and what is seen have important implications for the overarching themes of , including notions of accountability, responsibility, illusion, and disillusion. She focuses on the linked characters of Daisy and Jordan Baker, Gatsby and Nick Carraway, to show how their convergences and divergences tell the entire store of Gatsby’s decline and fall.","Last time, we talked about the odd presence of race in . Today, I would like to talk about this as the sensations of vagueness. I would like to highlight it in terms of a cross-mapping of sight and sound, because this is not something that we do all the time. And then the third–really, this is the central structure that I’d like to talk about today–is this visual-auditory coupling as thematic coupling. So once again, lots and lots of really interesting details and packed moments that invite us, compel us, to give interpretation to. And what allows this visual image to have such tremendous thematic weight is actually an intrusion of sound into that image. So we also know that Daisy doesn’t appear by herself, so it’s important that she appears with Jordan Baker, that the first glimpse that we have is of the two of them on that enormous couch, and both occupants of a visual field that carries noise. And the car really is a key player in  in all kinds of contexts. And Nick seems to know that, so this is really one of the many signs that this is not going to come to anything. She is a bad driver because she’s lost her nerve. Very precise in naming the number of that unit. ”This is in the context of Nick’s visit to the Buchanan household, and Nick is just about to find out about Tom’s affair with Myrtle. This is what Fitzgerald alludes to, about the new world and the “fresh, green breast of the new world,” at the very end of : some people actually have the capability for endless new beginnings. But Nick and Gatsby also have something else in common as well, in that even though sound is what keeps them going for a good part of the novel, actually, at some point, sound is also extinguished for them. Here is Nick actually watching Tom and Daisy after the accident when Tom and Daisy are back in the house. Once in a while, she looked up at him and nodded in agreement. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight is upon the scarcely created grass. So I want now to start another train of thought that points to a difference between Nick and Gatsby. But here’s Nick talking to Jordan Baker, the day after the accident.“ Nick had conjectured earlier that Gatsby didn’t care if the phone call came or not, but that’s obviously not true. So the colossal vitality of illusion, and that is what’s deathless about Daisy in Gatsby’s own mind and what enables Gatsby to be deathless to some extent as well, in spite of his physical, biological death. That’s why this marriage is not going to take place. Anyway, this is Fitzgerald’s way of encouraging us to think about different constellations, different configurations, of characters."
46,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-6,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock begins her discussion of by presenting Faulkner’s main sources for the novel, including Act V, Scene 5 of  and theories of mental deficiency elaborated by John Locke and Henry Goddard. Her main focus is on the experimental subjectivity of the novel’s first section which is narrated by Benjy Compson, a mentally retarded 33 year old who is completely innocent of his family’s decline and fall in 1920s Jefferson, Mississippi. Professor Dimock traces Benjy’s preoccupation with his sister Caddy and her sexual innocence through his sense of smell, and the repeated phrase “Caddy smelled like trees.” She concludes by observing that Faulkner protects Benjy from the loss of Caddy by allowing him to move seamlessly between the present and the past, shielding him in his own memories. ","And I just want to show you a few images of Faulkner’s Oxford, Oxford, Mississippi. Benjy’s section is obviously a tale told by an idiot, and that’s the challenge that Faulkner takes upon himself – to use mental retardation as a constraint on narration and to take up the challenge that comes from that constraint. What would you do differently?This is to cultivate a self-consciousness about the paper as a paper, what goes into the paper, what you are free and able to put into the paper at one moment and what future projects, what future versions of the paper you might want to do. That’s very, very important to keep in mind. And we’ll think about what that means for “idiocy” to be a form of self-centeredness. So this is what I’ll try to show in the course of this lecture. One of the most important is the philosopher John Locke. Sending someone to Jackson just means sending him to the lunatic asylum. And “moron,” again, a word that we use without thinking about it, had a clinical definition, arrested between seven and 12.So as you can see, by the early 20th century, the scientific thinking about mental retardation was moving more and more towards a quantitative approach. It is told from inside the consciousness of an idiot with the blind self-centeredness of innocence being front and center. You can watch them again when we get to the branch. In his classic on , Freud argues that the development of human sexuality makes it less and less dependent on the sense of smell, that the sense of smell becomes less and less central to the demonstration and the articulation of human sexuality. It is a story that we have to reconstruct by following one particular phrase that has to do with the sense of smell. She put her arms around me again, and I went away. ‘ We can think of it both in terms of the physical act of putting her arms around Benjy but also wrapping her mind around Benjy, someone who’s not able to tell her what is wrong. So just to stop that noise, Caddy has to figure out what it is that is upsetting Benjy to this extent. So we’ve just looked at one kind of arithmetic in the earlier use of the pronoun “we.” So let’s not romanticize Benjy and just call him innocent. Then she put her arm across her face, and I pushed at her, crying. This time, that solution isn’t going to work. And the way Faulkner is telling that story is by this technique of Benjy not finishing his sentences. And that’s just how things are going to be for him forever, trying to say something, trying to express himself to the world without the resources of language and without the manual capacity to do so. Something is lacking, something is missing from Benjy’s world. So the two of them actually do have this in common – I wouldn’t push this point so far, it’s really not a consolation to anyone to have that particular common ground – but this is the symmetry that Faulkner is creating for Benjy and Caddy. So this is the very end of the Benjy section. Then the dark began to go in smooth, bright shapes, like it always does, even when Caddy says that I have been asleep."
47,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-7,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock continues her discussion of  by juxtaposing Quentin’s stream-of-consciousness to his brother Benjy’s narrative subjectivity. Professor Dimock argues that Faulkner uses stylistic parallels between the two sections to communicate “kinship” and “variation” between the two narrators. In her readings, she focuses on their relationship with the black characters in , as well as their reactions to Caddy’s loss of sexual innocence. She concludes with a discussion of Quentin’s suicide as a reaction to the “second-hand tragedy” of Caddy’s pregnancy.","This is an interesting image of Faulkner in Japan. And we’ll think about the extent to which they are brothers. And in fact, it doesn’t take brothers to have that common ground – especially  if we think about race relations, the future of race, the “tomorrow” that Faulkner gets from Macbeth Act V, Scene Five. When they’re given scope, they use it fully. This is the very end, towards the very end of the Benjy section. We are actually in exactly the same position as Benjy. And his well-being is completely dependent and, of a piece with the well-being of the black world. His eyes were soft and irisless and brown, and suddenly I saw Roskus watching me from behind all his whitefolks’ claptrap of uniforms and politics and Harvard manner, diffident, secret, inarticulate and sad. And lack of self-assurance from some time past. In his own mind, the Deacon can move very, very fast from the south to the north. And that agility of movement is partly what gives him a future. Because he’s not actually deferring to Quentin anymore. Deference is a thing of the past, a thing of the geographical south, and now in Massachusetts, he’s actually conferring something. When she cannot, he just keeps on doing it. So from Quentin, we have this added perspective of what Benjy is doing to Caddy. Let’s think about this, by way of the one thread that Faulkner is giving us. Follow that to try to get us from the beginning of Quentin’s chapter, not quite as linear as I would like, but I’ll try to get us from the beginning of Quentin’s section to the end of Quentin’s section. Benji doesn’t understand Caddy because he doesn’t have the mental capacity for it. And Quentin doesn’t understand Caddy because he’s never had the experience. It wouldn’t have been so unbearable for him. And so this is the point where Benjy and Quentin are really kin. Because we also know that, unlike the Benjy section, Caddy is a very fleeting presence in the Quentin section. But actually, it takes more reading than doing a lot of outside research. So this is one way in which sister and water constitute a potential mapping in Quentin’s mind. “And father said it’s because you are a virgin: don’t you see? And that is the tragedy that he’s going to fight to put an end to claim, once and for all, by doing what he does at the end of the novel."
48,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-8,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock discusses Jason’s section of  with reference to Raymond Williams’s notion of the “knowable community.” Jasons’s narrative is characterized by the loss of that knowable community, by his pointed rage against his family and servants, as well as his diffuse anger against larger, unknowable entities like the “New York Jews,”  Wall Street, Western Union, and the United States government. Professor Dimock reads this anger as a harbinger of the modern condition: a threatening world in which strangers and impersonality reign supreme. In her reading, she shows Faulkner expressing qualified sympathy for Jason, whose loss of a utopian model of community is represented with sadness and pathos in the final sections of the novel.","I just wanted to start with two announcements. He wants her always to be an innocent young girl, never to become a woman. In many ways, it is a battle for an impossible, unchanging innocence. Jason seems very different on the face of it. But I’d like to suggest that in at least one way, Jason can be seen as a brother to Benjy and Quentin, in that he also has his own battle with time. So we are seeing scale enlargement in a significant way in the Jason section. Because we’re talking so much about yesterday and tomorrow, I want to bring back that very important passage from , Act V, Scene 5, that Faulkner took the phrase “the sound and the fury” from. “ The phrase that I would like to use to think about that transition from the past to the present is the concept that I’m taking from the literary and cultural critic Raymond Williams, the notion of the knowable community and how that’s receding into the past, that’s breaking down, to be replaced by an unknowable world of strangers. I says you think I’d fool with that dam car at all if it depended on me. ”In the space of two paragraphs, we see that Jason has shifted his attention from his niece, Quentin, to the government who’s not keeping up the roads. Not because Jason doesn’t want to know him – well, maybe Jason doesn’t– in any case, that knowledge will never extend further than the color of his tie and occupational label that Jason can pin on him. It is a world that is by definition made up of our superficial knowledge of total strangers, people we see once and never again. And here I want to stop very briefly and say a word about plagiarism. And I’ll just give you another instance of that, very much in the same vein. “ Like I say, if he had to sell something to send Quentin to Harvard we’d all been a dam sight better off if he’d sold that sideboard and bought himself a one-armed strait jacket with part of the money. And what kind of a monster do you get when nobody ever gives a thought to his well-being?So in many ways, Faulkner– and I’m just preparing you for the ending of , where I do think that even though Jason is a loser, once again, Faulkner does something for that loser. And here we see some of the reason for that sadness. The last thing that gives him satisfaction is going to be taken away from him. ”Incredible scale enlargement in the world of Jason, not only New York City, but Central America as well. And this is a picture of Hester Street, turn of the century. Instead, the New York Jew that he has in mind is very similar, is a kind of transnational Jew. So people who are far away, you never set sight on them, they are harming you in some fashion. And the most significant relation that he has is to his money, held in jeopardy now by the national banks on Wall Street. All those people are probably much bigger investors than Jason. All of us want to know the people we’re having transactions with."
49,american-studies,amst-246,lecture-9,"Professor Wai Chee Dimock closes her reading of  by reading section four–the section related by an omniscient narrator–through Luster and Dilsey, the two black characters whose personal and racial histories are woven into the history of the Compson family. Luster and Dilsey’s centrality to the final section of the novel, particularly their interactions with the Reverent Shegog on Easter Sunday, transform  into a story of redemption; they reconstitute a sense of community whose loss is mourned in Jason’s section. Professor Dimock concludes by reading the final scene of section four–Jason’s taking over of the horse Queenie from Luster’s control–as Jason’s brief and heroic redemption, the only respite that Faulkner grants Jason in the course of the novel.","I think a question that would have to arise for everyone is why isn’t Caddy the person to be telling the story in section four? So it came out in the Modern Library edition. So this is his very, very long entry on Caddy. And that is the two people that he mentions at the end of the appendix. A man, aged 14, who was not only capable of the complete care and security of an idiot twice his age and three times his size, but could keep him entertained. It is the section devoted to the third-person plural by way of someone like Dilsey. We see a shift between outside and inside. Omniscient narration is an external point of view, but quite often, there’s a shift back to the interior of Dilsey, and along with that shift, a tension between sight and sound, between the visual and the auditory registers. So we’re not quite at a place where we can talk about a community made up of humans and non-humans, but it is interesting that it is not the automobile but the horse that comes back in a big way at the very end of .Let’s start out with omniscient narration. She’s wearing clothes too good for her station. The sound that she makes is still attached to the work that she has to do. So what we’ll see in section four, I think this is the structure that Faulkner is working, a really very intricate and very well-crafted structure, is to give us one moment that is emblematic of Dilsey that is a response, a rejoinder, or an amendment to an earlier moment that was problematic in one of the preceding sections. Even though she’s hard-working, she’s not up at five AM. First of all, the clock is really not doing a number of things. And this emblematic moment about Dilsey obviously brings back an equally emblematic moment about Quentin and his relation to his watch. He is bloodied in his struggle with time. The local Methodist church actually belongs to a national denomination. It sounded too big to have come from him and they listened at first through curiosity, as they would have to a monkey talking. And even when he starts speaking, he’s still off-putting. These are the two poles that Faulkner tries to negotiate by way of the Reverend Shegog, that he could be looked at just as a single individual, this big-shot preacher from St. Louis, or he could be fused with a community as a voice speaking for them. And we know that Luster actually does have that kind of knowledge. That episode is resurrected as well in the absent-mindedness of Luster. Luster looked quickly back over his shoulder, then he drove on. ”What went wrong initially with the ride is that Luster, for some reason, had forgotten that they’re supposed to go to the right of the monument. So after all we’ve seen – Jason’s terrible problems with the automobile –  at the very end of , Faulkner is able to resurrect Jason into a much happier fate."
50,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-10,"The lecture begins with the development of post-Newtonian approximations from Newtonian terms. Several problems are worked out in calculating mass, force and energy. A discussion follows about how concepts like mass and velocity are approached differently in Newtonian physics and Relativity. Attention then turns to the discovery that space and time change near the speed of light, and how this realization affected Einstein’s theories. Finally, the possibility of traveling faster than the speed of light is addressed, including how physicists might predict from laboratory conditions how this might occur. Muons, unstable particles that form at the top of the Earth’s atmosphere, are used as an example.","And right at the end of last class, I had written down this factor, γ. When the velocity approaches the speed of light, then this total relativistic mass goes to infinity–the consequence of which is that you can no longer accelerate, regardless of how much–so, no more acceleration–regardless of how much force is applied, because force equals mass times acceleration. An acceleration is a change in velocity, and so, the consequence of this is that you can’t go faster than the speed of light. There’s no escape velocity here, at the moment. So,  over  or more properly,  /  is small, but not zero. And the series goes like this: 1 +  ε, plus a bunch of other terms, each of which is multiplied by a higher power of epsilon. So this is, in this context, going to be a Newtonian term, and this is the post-Newtonian approximation. And so,  /  = [(3 x 10) / (3 x 10)] = 10. This can be expanded in just this kind of way. So, this is the mass equivalent of the kinetic energy. And come up, in consultation with your neighbors, with a question to ask. Now, this could either be a question of something that you guys don’t understand about what I’ve said, or something where the question, if answered, would deepen your understanding beyond what I’ve said. If your particular question doesn’t end up being answered, you know, hand it in at the end, so that I know what you were thinking of–and so, definitely write them down. And in Newtonian physics, the mass is a property of the object. And then you see these very dramatic effects. But, that’s why photons don’t have any rest mass at all. There is an equation of relativistic momentum. And then, work also has a technical definition. So this is–so, the inertial mass is equal to the Newtonian mass, plus a term that looks like this. That depends how good your instruments are. But, if you ask, how long did it take them to get from the top of the atmosphere down to where your muon detector is, it’s much, much longer than their decay time. What would happen is, as you go faster than the speed of light, if you try and slow down toward the speed of light, you’d have the same problem. Turns out–and this is one of the things that led Einstein to his theory of general relativity–turns out that relativistically, it’s–that gravity should not be thought of as a force, at all. You have to put–you have to get the  squareds in the right place, and that’s basically a unit conversion. And a particle at zero rest mass has to have this thing go to infinity or it doesn’t exist at all. You would expect it to be  plus .But it isn’t."
51,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-11,The lecture begins with a comprehensive overview of the historical conditions under which Einstein developed his theories. Of particular impact were the urgent need at the turn of the 19th century to synchronize clocks around the world; Einstein’s position at a patent office; and a series of experiments that he himself carried out. In 1905 Einstein published three papers that are still considered the greatest papers in the field of physics. The lecture then moves to General Relativity and how it encompasses Newton’s laws of gravity. A visual demonstration shows how space-time undergoes curvature when mass is introduced. Class ends with a question-and-answer period on a variety of topics in Special Relativity.,"And where we ended up last time–we were talking about special relativity and all the weird things that happen to space and time. So, the low sophistication moral, moral number one, here, is, you know, about the genius in obscurity. I’ve actually had a fall-off on this, because I haven’t been, you know, quoted opining about black holes in  recently. And so, anytime you see something where you’re–where they’re going to revolutionize all of science, it’s certainly wrong. Because, what was he doing in the patent office?Well, it turns out that in the early part of the twentieth century, one of the big set of inventions that was coming through were ways of synchronizing clocks. They would figure out when the Sun was directly overhead. So, the current feeling among, at least, some historians of science, is that the patent office was, in fact, key to Einstein’s thinking. So, general relativity, known as GR, for short, is now a theory of gravity. In this, it’s how much the force is created. He drops a cannonball, or something, and watches it fall. And so, everything falls from the tower at the same rate. He brought up a cannonball, and a wooden ball, and a whole bunch of other objects, dropped them, and discovered that the Greeks had been wrong. All other forces don’t have this consequence. That looks almost identical to what the gravitational force looks like. And there’s no excuse within Newtonian theory to explain why that might be, and why all objects move–therefore, move the same when put in a gravitational field. This is the kind of thing that bothered him. So, the metaphor is to use two spatial dimensions to represent what is actually a four–conceptually, a four-dimensional space. And so, this is one of those situations where you have a Newtonian physics in relatively low gravitational fields. There are many other forces in the world. Because they’re not actually being forced to move anywhere. And so, that’s why this kind of curvature provides an explanation for what, in the Newtonian approximation, is the equality of the inertial and the gravitational mass. And it’s caused by–the mass of the Sun warps the space–  Yeah, yeah, yeah. We are, you know–you can explain the motion of the Earth in terms of these so-called space-time diagrams, where one–you take the four-dimensional thing. And so, it turns out that the straight line looks like this. So, there is a reason why that particular velocity is chosen, and it’s not surprising, if you had to pick a velocity, that you would end up with the speed of light, which has this sort of profound importance."
52,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-12,"One last key concept in Special Relativity is introduced before discussion turns again to black celestial bodies (black holes in particular) that manifest the relativistic effects students have learned about in the previous lectures. The new concept deals with describing events in a coordinate system of space and time. A mathematical explanation is given for how space and time reverse inside the Schwarzschild radius through sign changes in the metric. Evidence for General Relativity is offered from astronomical objects. The predicted presence and subsequent discovery of Neptune as proof of General Relativity are discussed, and stellar mass black holes are introduced.Step by Step into a Black HoleCourtesy of Ute Kraus, Max-Planck-Institut für Gravitationsphysik, Golm,and Theoretische Astrophysik, Universität TübingenBlack Holes and Neutron Stars“Written Description of Visible Distortion Effects”Courtesy of Robert Nemiroff, Michigan Technological University","I want to do one last foray into relativity theory. So, why use to convert time to space and vice versa? If I now take this coordinate system and I shift it like this, now it’s going to be totally different. And as you change your velocity–as the space, as the mass, as the time all change–this quantity, describing the separation of two events–so, this describes the separation of two events, that quantity changes–doesn’t change. So, things that have one of these intervals of zero are separated by an appropriate amount so that the same ray of light can participate in both of them. This is the metric for flat space with no mass present. I should say, you can also write this down. For technical reasons, these have to be differential. You need two angles and a distance in three space. Where  is the Schwarzschild radius, which we’ve had before, which is 2 / .Okay, so this is just like the flat metric with two exceptions. And you can only travel along negative intervals. Basically, you remember, things go from one event to another in the shortest possible path, that’s the equivalent of a straight line. On Earth the–the distances and the velocities and the gravitational fields are never so strong that you have any trouble–that the Δ T changes significantly depending on what your point of view is. Special relativity, there were all these experiments that needed to be explained. And that was quickly explained by the presence of an unknown–hitherto unknown planet, which was also exerting a gravitational force on Uranus and pulling it out of the orbit that it should have been, by a very small amount, because the gravitational force of another planet is very small compared to that of the Sun. Everybody–if they had had Nobel Prizes back then, they would have won it for this, for sure. And it gradually becomes clear that everybody’s fooling themselves. And so, it turns out that all of this is wrong. So, then the people calculating the orbits have to go back and say, well, if Vulcan isn’t there, maybe there are two or three planets combining together to do the thing that we originally wanted Vulcan to do. And he now gets something that agrees with the observations, without the need for a new planet. And so, the relativistic effects, the general relativity effects, are relatively large. This is 3 kilometers, the Schwarzschild radius of the Sun. The orbit doesn’t move or doesn’t change. And it’s measured in some angle per time. So, the moral here is aesthetic considerations, aesthetic–perhaps you want to call this philosophical, considerations can lead to a good new theory because he didn’t really do it to explain the data. We computed, at some point, the Schwarzschild radius of the Earth,  /  is the relevant quantity, and it’s really small from the Earth’s gravitational field."
53,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-13,"Class begins with clarification of equations from the previous lecture. Four post-Newtonian gravitational effects are introduced and discussed in detail. The first of these is the so-called Perihelion Precession, which occurs when the major axis of a planet’s elliptical orbit precesses within its orbital plane, in response to changing gravitational forces exerted by other planets. Secondly, deflection of light is described as the curving of light as it passes near a large mass. Gravitational redshift is explained as a frequency effect that occurs as light moves away from a massive body such as a star or black hole. Finally, the existence and effects of gravitational waves are discussed. The lecture closes with a brief history of the 1919 eclipse expedition that made Einstein famous.","Last time, I wrote down the Schwarzschild metric, which was the sort of culmination of the theoretical part of the–of this section of the course. But the radius of the object doesn’t matter. Could you please explain the diagram that you  This right here? Only this mass counts towards the Schwarzschild radius. So, in that case, all the mass is going to be closer than– All the–yeah, all–well, all the mass–  If the radius of the object is smaller than its Schwarzschild radius, then all the mass is inside the Schwarzschild radius. Imagine, for example, a black hole with an atmosphere. So, just to go back, if you take that metric and you kind of expand it in small quantities where the Schwarzschild radius is much, much smaller than wherever you are. Here are you, you’re observing something. Now, because the path is going to curve, the path that the light takes from the star to your eye is going to now look like something like this. That comes about when the intervening mass is not spherical. And what also happens is, if you’re looking at something big, like a galaxy, that has a shape, it distorts the shape. Then it would–if you looked at it at night when the Sun wasn’t in the way. Okay, so–but the principle is–supposing the Sun were dark, okay. Look at star behind the Sun, or right next to the Sun, really. But, you know, you have to travel to get there. In 1917, Einstein publishes his theory of general relativity. And as part of this, the British mount an expedition to confirm a German theory of science. And, I actually have to say, I’m not sure what the outcome of this is–whether people have actually gone back and tried to measure this again. So, that’s the second post-Newtonian test. Okay, there are a couple of other post-Newtonian effects. Or due to being emitted in a curved space-time, if you want to use the relativistic formulation. So, in this particular case it would be the radius of the object, minus 1. Now, that, too, has to lose energy as it moves away from the Earth. The difference in the wavelength you see is this quantity at the event horizon, minus this quantity a little bit above the event horizon, because it’s still going to be redshifted. You have your light source up here, and you observe it from down here, and then you’ll see it blueshifted. But you can see this in certain kinds of binary stars. Stars which happen to have very short orbits."
54,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-14,"Professor Bailyn begins with a summary of the four post-Newtonian effects of general relativity that were introduced and explained last time: precession of the perihelion, the deflection of light, the gravitational redshift, and gravitational waves. The concept of gravitational lensing is discussed as predicted by Einstein’s general relativity theory. The formation of a gravitational lens can be observed when light from a bright distant source bends around a massive object between the source (such as a quasar) and the observer. Professor Bailyn then offers a slideshow of gravitational lenses. The issue of finding suitable astronomical objects that lend the opportunity to observe post-Newtonian relativistic effects is addressed. The lecture ends with Jocelyn Bell and the discovery of pulsars.","I’ve been talking about general relativity, and in particular, the post-Newtonian, relativistic effects. And what has happened is, if there were no deflection of light, you’d see this quasar, kind of, right behind the galaxy. And in fact, it would be hard to distinguish between the two. And they know it’s the same quasar, because they’ve taken spectra of the thing, and it’s the exact same spectrum on all four of these things. And so, these are just four different images of the same object. In principle, you could see it, right through here, but there are two things about the path that comes right at us. Oh, it’s not the black hole that’s emitting the light. I’ll actually talk about this on Thursday a little bit. So, this is a Hubble Space Telescope picture of a cluster of galaxies. So, there are two paths from that tower to your eye, and you can see both of them. And so, they worked out all the distortions of this, and so, they like to show this kind of amusing picture. Moving on, number three, here, is what we talked about last time, which is the gravitational redshift. That’s a definition of this quantity, , which is often used. And this  is the distance of the light source from that mass. So, to figure out what that is, you figure out the redshift from the source to infinity. And that gives you the redshift from the source to the observer. Now, it turns out, this is a relatively small effect, and it is not observed in the Solar System, even in Mercury, which has the strongest relativistic effect. The problem with general relativity is you can’t actually study it all that much in the lab, because, in order to study it, you need strong gravitational forces. And this is not something that one can do. And this was the first direct evidence that neutron stars existed. Well, this is the whole debate about who should have gotten the Nobel Prize. And when it’s pointing towards you, you see light. Oh, and I should say, in problem one on the problem set, you can use the Newtonian approximation, because, as you’ll discover, the velocity of the object as it goes around in its orbit is significantly less than the speed of light. You’re not seeing the gravitational redshift, due to the fact that the clock is sitting on a neutron star. The consequence, by the way, is that if these things are in a circular orbit, you can’t see the gravitational redshift, because they’re always the same distance away from each other, and the gravitational redshift doesn’t change. And it’s because, each one of these things, you don’t maintain a constant distance from the center of mass. So, if you now measure the precession of the periastron, then this also–the amount of that also depends on , , the two masses, and the inclination. And this, again, depends, in a different way, on , , and the inclination. Remember, all these effects are post-Newtonian only."
55,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-15,"The lecture begins with a question-and-answer session about black holes. Topics include the extent to which we are sure black holes exist in the center of all galaxies, how massive they are, and how we can observe them. The lecture then turns to strong-field relativity: relativistic effects that are unrelated to Newtonian theory. The possibility of testing predictions of the existence of black holes is discussed in the context of strong-field relativity. One way we might learn about black holes is through observation of the orbit of the companion star in an X-ray binary star system. Through this we can estimate the mass of the compact object. The lecture ends with an explanation of how astronomers find black holes, and how Professor Bailyn was able to discover one himself.","Okay, this is the last class of the section on black holes and relativity. That hasn’t been done yet, but it will be soon, I think. Why are they in the middle of all the galaxies? And that was an example of a very detailed test of post-Newtonian relativity. The Sun emits x-rays, and you would not want to be in a place in which you didn’t have an atmosphere to absorb the x-rays on the way to yourself. And so, the fact that the atmosphere absorbs x-rays is good for everybody, except for the x-ray astronomers, because it makes it difficult to do these kinds of observations. So, this only got started at the point where you could put satellites into orbit outside the atmosphere, and equip them with x-ray detectors, basically Geiger Counters. If the Sun were five times bigger, it would emit 5 more radiation. Brightness varies, and it varies quickly, hundreds of times a second. And the idea, here, is that one of these stars is a kind of ordinary star like the Sun, got a slightly weird shape, which I’ll explain in a minute. This pulls one part of the star towards it and that distorts the ordinarily spherical shape. And so, basically, the gas goes into orbit around the compact object. So, the gas in this disk gradually spirals in. So, that’s what these x-ray sources are supposed, in principle, to be. The nearby objects are not getting pulled apart. All right, so, having found a bunch of these x-ray binaries, the question is, “Can you tell whether they’re black holes or not?”And now, let me remind you that the mass of a neutron star has to be less than the three times the mass of the Sun. And it turns out, you can prove the following relationship. Why would you do–why would you express it in this particular form? So, this term up here has to be less than 1. The x-rays turn on in one of these transient systems. This happens after a few months, typically. And so, I thought I’d show you an example of how this works out in real life. There’s not enough friction to drive it down in there, no x-rays, and basically, all you can see is the companion star. So, let me now take you back fifteen years in time. You’ve probably never heard of the constellation of Musca–Musca the Fly. This is an observatory in Chile where you can see the southern hemisphere, among other things. First thing we observed was this point, right after sunset. So, the next point was a little skewed for reasons that we never explained in our paper. And you can ask yourself whether event horizons actually exist. So, the black things here are the black holes."
56,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-16,"The third and final part of the course begins, consisting of a series of lectures on cosmology. A brief history of how cosmology developed into a scientific subject is offered. The discovery of dark energy, along with dark matter, played a crucial role in the development of cosmology. The lecture then discusses the discovery of spiral nebulae in 1920, as well as the “Great Debate” over what they were. Hubble’s famous redshift diagram is presented as the basis for Hubble’s Constant and Big Bang cosmology. The difficulty of measuring distance of objects in space, and how to do it using the parallax method and the standard candle method, are discussed. Measure brightness using the magnitude scale is explained. Class ends with a review of logarithms.","One of the most amazing things that’s happened over the past half century or so is that cosmology, which is the study of the Universe as a whole, has become a scientific subject, and something that one can say something about in scientific terms, rather than merely philosophical terms. And that actually, you know, it doesn’t sound so good. And so, all these stars–that’s our galaxy. And so, he had many good reasons to think this. And that even the brightest stars in these things were incredibly faint. And what he discovered is that these things were very tightly correlated. And the primary scientific purpose of the Hubble Space Telescope, the largest and most expensive science project ever created, was to get an accurate measurement of the Hubble Constant. And so, for each megaparsec that a given galaxy is away–and notice, now, we’ve changed our units from parsecs, which we used for stars, to megaparsecs. What I want to talk about now is much more mundane. And that shooting star is in the top of the atmosphere. Oh, how do you know what the original wavelength was? Now, one of the things you can do if you don’t like what the cosmological implications of things is, you can say, well, rather than interpreting this as cosmology, let’s just say that in distant portions of the Universe, physics is different. Whereas, when you observe it here, it’s in a little bit of a different position with respect to the other stars. And so, if you observe this star repeatedly over the course of the year, it appears to move back and forth against the background of the other stars. These other galaxies are megaparsecs away. So, most other distance measurements–methods of distance–are some form of what’s called the Standard Candle Method. This is basically a version of what Hubble did when he figured out that the spiral nebulae must be very, very distant, and must, therefore, be island universes. In the case of Hubble, he’s looking at the brightest stars in the galaxy. It goes as one over the distance, squared. How do you know how bright the thing is in the first place? Astronomers count brightness upside down and logarithmically. You should always do all your arithmetic in logarithms. Or you can do problem sets in Astronomy 160. 0 is a brighter star than 2; 2 is a brighter star than 5, and so forth. And that, by the way, is why, again, why logarithms are such good news. And so–oh, I haven’t told you an important thing yet. Little , that’s the apparent magnitude, minus big , that’s the absolute magnitude, is equal to 5 times the logarithm of the distance over 10 parsecs."
57,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-17,"Class begins with a review of magnitudes and the problem set involving magnitude equations. Implications of the Hubble Law and Hubble Diagram are discussed. Professor Bailyn elaborates on the Big Bang theory of cosmology and addresses controversial questions related to the age, development, and boundaries of the universe. The fate of the universe, and possibly its end (known as the Big Crunch) are addressed. Imagining an expanding three-dimensional universe is proposed. The lecture ends with a question-and-answer session during which students inquire about a variety of topics related to cosmology, such as the center of the universe, its current expansion, and hypothetical collapse.","What I want to do today is quickly review what we were doing about magnitudes and make a comment or two about the problem set, and then, go back and talk about the implications of the Hubble Law and the Hubble Diagram, which are formidable, to put it mildly. And so, in this way, you can solve for the difference without actually being able to determine either one of these two things. I want to start understanding how this plot and this little equation gives you all these wonderful things. Let’s imagine that we sit on point–that the observer is on point . And it goes to a distance of 8, which is where  ends up, and 10, which is where ends up. So, that’s the key point–that if you take a coordinate system and you expand it, you naturally get this relationship between distance and velocity. Now, this gives rise to–this analogy, with these stretching one-dimensional lines gives rise to two questions people have, which I like to call un-questions, because they’re actually questions that arise because of the analogy, not because of the way the Universe works. And it’s going to expand into something that looks like this:  And all of what we just did about the velocity, and so forth, remains the same. And here’s Phelps, and it’s moved a little further, straight away from us. Starbucks is moving away from us, and so forth. And now, because the distances are greater, you can see the effect that the velocity is greater at greater distances. And the Earth, you know–where is the center of the surface of the Earth? Now, if something’s moving faster than the speed of light, of course, you can’t see it, because the light from that is redshifted down to greater than infinite wavelengths. One is, they can move; they can change their position. And in particular, in the case of the current Universe, the increase in the scale factor. And these two kinds of velocity are conceptually different from each other. So, if the scale factor is expanding, you know, the Old Campus, whatever, is expanding, and you reverse time and you think about what happened long ago, it must have been smaller. What it is, is it’s many points superposed on each other. But then, if you increase this so that it becomes epsilon or some non-zero number, times , ,  then you already get the geometry of the Old Campus and everything else on the surface of the Earth. All the space, all the empty space is contained in that point. That implies this kind of coordinate expansion. There is a center of the Universe, isn’t there? Well I have–first, just simply, I didn’t understand why it’s 0 times the coordinate, why there’s a point at all and why there’s just nothing. Everything has to be equidistant  No, no, no, no, no. That’s true if you have constant curvature. If it wasn’t expanding at approximately the rate it is, we wouldn’t be here to notice it. No, that’s a fourth spatial dimension that I’m talking about in this case. So, in other words, spatial dimension  It’s expanding into a dimension which we don’t perceive. And so, that is a question that’s empirically answerable. But that has to do with peculiar motions, not the overall motion of the Universe."
58,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-18,"Professor Bailyn returns to the subject of the expansion of the universe to offer explanations that do not require belief in the Big Bang theory. One alternative is a theory that, in the past, the entire universe was reduced to an “initial singularity,” in which everything was much closer, and therefore denser and hotter. Since the universe is in constant flux, however, it follows that in the future things will drift apart. The Steady State explanation for the expansion of the universe is then explained. Coined as a derogatory term meant to ridicule supporters of the Big Bang theory, Steady State purports that new energy and matter are constantly created as the universe expands, to fill in the void that results from the expansion. The discovery of quasars refuted the Steady State theory. The lecture ends with a discussion of how observing very distant objects allows us to look back in time, and also gives us a glimpse into the future of galaxies and the universe.","We’ve been talking about the expansion of the Universe and in answer–I want to follow up on something I said kind of in answer to a question last time, which is that it turns out that the expansion of the Universe alone doesn’t require you to have a Big Bang. And people send in suggestions and it never gets anywhere. And the consequence of that is that the past and the future both have similar bulk characteristics. And so, we don’t have to start asking these awkward questions about what’s outside the Universe. That’s what we think they are now, but they didn’t know it then. And you’d think that this would be a very good thing–some kind of unknown energy source would be just the thing for the “steady state” people, because that’s what they needed. So, these things were known to be large distances away. And so, this came from a time–this radiation, which you can easily detect with radio telescopes and the like, comes from a time when then Universe was much denser, hotter, and smoother than it is today–again, in accordance with the prediction of the Big Bang. So, everything points toward the Big Bang and away from the “steady state,” much to the surprise of a lot of the scientists who felt, possibly correctly, given what was known in the 1950s, that the “steady state” was a much more elegant solution. And the moral, well, there are various morals to this, but let me be provocative and say that, sometimes science is anti-atheistic, not anti-religious. Because it could have come out the other way, right? And if that had been true, the geneticists would have discovered that instead of what they did discover. So, if you use Big Bang to indicate that particular moment, then you can say that the scientific evidence for that actual moment isn’t strong, and indeed, couldn’t even exist within our current theories, because all of physics breaks down, there. And so, this is now the kind of currently accepted theory. And you have to come up with a plausible thing that you’re going to do. Let me do a simpler calculation, but exactly analogous. And you are 100 miles away from your starting point. If you are 100 miles away, you take time is equal to distance over velocity [=]. is equal to 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec. This is the scale factor of the Universe, which started at 0. And so, it is this amount of time that turns out to be 17 billion years. So, in fact, you might say that what we’ve really shown is that the Universe has to be less than 17 billion years old. So, the implication of Hubble’s result in the Big Bang context, at least, was that the Universe was 2.5 billion years old. And we’ve got  / , so that’s .And here’s the key thing: the s cancel. If you take a large enough region that includes all the empty space, it turns out that the average density of the Universe is actually surprisingly close to this critical value at which the Universe will be balanced between expanding forever and re-collapsing."
59,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-19,"Class begins with a review of the issues previously addressed about the origin and fate of the universe. The role of gravity in the expansion of the universe is discussed and given as the reason why the rate of expansion cannot remain constant and will eventually slow down. The actual density of the universe is calculated using various methods. Finally, the unsolved problem of dark matter is addressed and two explanatory hypotheses are proposed. One is that the universe is comprised of WIMPs (Weakly Interactive Massive Particles) that fulfill two requirements: they have mass and do not interact with light. The second hypothesis is that dark matter is made of MACHOs (Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects), which scientists have attempted to identify through gravitational lenses.","Okay, we’re talking about the origin and fate of the Universe. And the other is what we discussed last time: that if you look back into the past, if you observe at a large distance–that is to say, a large lookback time–what you discover is that things were different in the past. Now, at this point, let me write down a piece of astronomical jargon, which I didn’t do last time. And then, you can describe the future of the Universe, depending on what Ω is. And then, you could figure out what’s going to happen. So, you say, well, we better include a lot of stars and the empty spaces between them. There are clusters of clusters of galaxies. And so, obviously, you have to identify all the different kinds of mass. You divide by the critical density and you know what’s going to happen to the Universe. You mean the equivalent of the absolute magnitude, which takes the distance into account. You can determine this; basically, in the case of galaxies, galaxies are big objects. You can physically measure the angular separation on the sky. And so, this is equal to 5 x 6.3.5 x 6 = 30.5 x .3 = 1.5.So, this is 31.5.Let me caution you at this point. Because if you then make the assumption that the mass-to-light ratio is the same as the Sun, that this galaxy consists entirely of Sun-like stars, then you can determine how massive it is. The minuses cancel out, so that’s a plus, actually.⁄ x 22.5 ‒ well, let’s see. How would you really know?And so, let’s go back and do the other approach–namely, figure out its mass from orbits of things around it. Stars are much less massive than galaxies so we don’t have to worry about the motion of the galaxy. But, what I’m doing is the exact same set of calculations, only done backwards. And, as I say, we have no idea what this stuff is. This is not such a crazy idea as it might, at first, seem. There are known sub-atomic particles that have these properties. So, the Japanese have, sort of, a cubic mile of distilled water, and they’re looking for little light flashes when the neutrino runs into the water molecule. Similarly, you can rule out some of these other things with certain characteristics, because you would have noticed they were there. But both of these hypotheses are still more or less viable. And real critical can be calculated–turns out to be, as you’ll discover on the problem set, 6 x 10 in these units.ρ over ρ is equal to about ⅓.So, if you buy that, the Universe is going to keep expanding, because Ω, the ratio of the density to the critical density is only about ⅓.But the problem is, we’ve got all this dark matter around and what we’re doing is, we’re adding up galaxies. And that’s what we’ll talk about next time."
60,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-1,"Professor Bailyn introduces the course and discusses the course material and requirements. The three major topics that the course will cover are (1) exoplanets–planets around stars other than the Sun, (2) black holes–stars whose gravitational pull is so strong that even their own light rays cannot escape, and (3) cosmology–the study of the Universe as a whole. Class proper begins with a discussion on planetary orbits. A brief history of astronomy is also given and its major contributors over the centuries are introduced: Ptolemy, Galileo, Copernicus, Kepler, and Newton.Professor Bailyn’s guide to Extrasolar Planet Websites","That portion of the enrollment policies is not a suggestion. I really don’t want science majors in this class. If you are a science major, I’m going to notice because that’s one of the things that appears on the class list; what your major is. But until 1995 there was not one bit of evidence to support that idea. That’s too big a topic to go into in depth, so I’ve picked one piece of it. The evidence for this comes largely, but not entirely, from observations of a certain kind of supernova. And second, that they all involve different manifestations of gravity. And then by the time we get to dark energy, it may not even be correctly described by Einstein’s work, and we may be in the area of whole new kinds of physics that the theorists haven’t even thought about yet. Introductory high school algebra, high school geometry, I think we take the sine of an angle a couple of times, but it’s the one case it cancels out almost immediately, so don’t let that scare you. Thirty percent comes from two midterm exams. But you do have to sign up for a section. But it’s very hard to make them come out even, but let me think about that. If we veer too much in either one direction that’s probably not a good thing. There are going to be two kinds of things on the problem sets. One are kind of quantitative problems which have a right answer. But we will also–because this is a course that’s not only about the specific of this topic but also about science in general, we’re also going to have things that look kind of like essay questions on the problem sets. And, in fact, this idea of circles on circles, on circles that isn’t the way epicycles worked, they had circles and they did get more complicated every time they fit the observations, but not by adding more and more circles. So, you put the Sun in the middle and everything, including the Earth, goes in circles around the Sun. Kepler was a famous astronomer and he had in his possession, because he stole them, the best naked-eye results that had ever been obtained of the motions of the planets, in particular, Mars. If you go take Physics 180 this is all that they do and they spend the whole time. Fortunately, people turn out to be pretty good at math, so we can actually solve these problems and move forward. And the situation with these is they don’t overturn Newton’s laws, they extend them. So, you have a situation where here are Newton’s laws, Ns Laws, of which Kepler’s laws are a tiny subset. The long side is the major axis; the short side is the minor axis. This is just saying that quantity is  in units of an Astronomical Unit. So, this is now much easier to work with. This is what the business people call thinking outside the box."
61,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-20,"This lecture introduces an important concept related to the past and future of the universe: the Scale factor, which is a function of time. With reference to a graph whose coordinates are the Scale factor and time, the problem of dark matter is addressed again. Cosmological redshifts are measured to determine the scale of the universe. The discovery of the repulsive, anti-gravitational force of dark energy is explained. The lecture concludes with discussion of Einstein’s biggest mistake: the invention of the cosmological constant to balance gravity.","Welcome back for more cosmology on a rainy day. The present is somewhere along this graph. And so, there’s a point here at–right now, the scale factor is 1.We also know what the slope of the scale factor is, because we measure that from the Hubble Constant. It falls off a little bit, continues to expand, something like that. You could, in principle, go out and measure the density of the Universe. Remember that you can look back into the past. And if you could figure that out, then you can infer, if that track continues without some other form of physics kicking in, you could figure out where it will go in the future. And the way to think about this is you have to think about the redshift, the cosmological redshift, in different terms from what we’ve been thinking about it so far. So, as the Universe expands, wavelengths of light expand along with it. So, this is another view of where the redshift comes from: that wavelengths of light expand along with the Universe. In this interpretation, it’s not because these things are moving away from us. And so, you define distance as the dimming of light, because that’s the way you measure the thing. Now, all of them are in the past, not the future, because you can’t look into the future by this light travel time trick. And if you measured a whole bunch of these things and they sort of lined up in this nice way, then you might conclude, well, the Universe is doing this, and you might then extrapolate to determine what the Universe is going to do in the future. And then, the brown curve will kind of do the same thing, only more so. Because you need to be able to see it at large distances. These are exploding stars and, as I say, we’ll talk about the details of exactly how these things work later on. And then, the brown line is this thing here, which is Ω = 1. Redshifts are relatively easy to observe. Because the lines are separated by a tiny fraction of a magnitude and the errors on these things, on any individual object, is several tenths of a magnitude. And so, one of these points would not tell you all that much. That’s about–a probability of one in a million. You don’t say: we have no idea what’s going on in the Universe. And so, you can ask: what is the density of the dark energy compared to matter?Now, you know how to compare energy to matter, right? It’s about three times the amount of matter–where Ω, remember, is equal to density over the critical density, and, you know, it doesn’t matter whether it’s an energy density divided by , or some amount of matter. So, this is all ordinary matter, and all ordinary kinds of energy, photons, what have you, that we know about. If you don’t know calculus, ignore that last sentence."
62,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-21,"Class begins with a review of the mysterious nature of dark matter, which accounts for three quarters of the universe. Different models of the universe are graphed. The nature, frequency, and duration of supernovae are then addressed. Professor Bailyn presents data from the Supernova Cosmology Project and pictures of supernovae taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The discovery of dark energy is revisited and the density of dark energy is calculated. The Big Rip is presented as an alternative hypothesis for the fate of the universe.","I’m talking about black holes at 8 o’clock this evening. You could–the way–if you want a nice straight line, you just make this axis logarithmic, as well. What we’ve done down on the bottom is just subtracted off the empty Universe–a Universe with no matter and no energy in it–so that you can see more clearly the way these three lines diverge. And these three lines are three different models of the Universe. So, by virtue of the fact that these points lie on the solid line rather than on somewhere between these two dotted lines, or perhaps even below, we make this remarkable conclusion: that the Universe is ¾ full of something we absolutely don’t understand, called dark energy, which has the effect of an anti-gravity. So, the material that comes from the normal stars, full of hydrogen and helium–it’s pretty much all hydrogen and helium. So, the accreted material, what does it do? Oh, the consequence of the nova is that all the hydrogen and helium gets fused into carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, neon, and so forth. A hundred milliseconds, something like that, but basically, all at once. The Europeans were, of course, in barbarity at the time and didn’t even notice. Because, it would be true, if you could measure all of the energy that came out of these things. And so, it turns out that if you measure all photons in some wavelength region at some time, that actually varies from one object to another. So -19.5, as I said, is a typical magnitude–absolute magnitude. First of all, let me just show you this picture. You would make your graduate students completely cross-eyed doing this. And there’s also an empirical basis, which is that after some corrections, the nearby ones line up beautifully. But if we observe enough of them, we can average over that and we think we’re going to be okay. They were saying, look at this, these things are getting–these things are going totally in the wrong direction. And in particular, one group were a bunch of particle physicists led by Saul Perlmutter, who had gotten depressed by the fact that the Super Collider was cancelled in the early 1990s, and had decided–somebody described this as “adult onset cosmology,” where you used to be interested in particle physics, but then, they didn’t build your machine, so now you’re interested in astrophysics. You know, the Universe also has a bunch of matter in it. So, for matter, you can get some density to the Universe now. But, of course, you have the same amount of matter in the Universe. So, it has to equal eight times the density. And, in fact, there’s extremely good empirical evidence of that, because you look back in time by looking at distant things. Suppose the dark energy density increases as the Universe gets bigger. Then, a cubic meter of volume has increasing dark energy as time goes along."
63,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-22,"Professor Bailyn offers a review of what is known so far about the expansion of the universe from observing galaxies, supernovae, and other celestial phenomena. The rate of the expansion of the universe is discussed along with the Big Rip theory and the balance of dark energy and dark matter in the universe over time. The point at which the universe shifts from accelerating to decelerating is examined. Worries related to the brightness of high redshift supernovae and the effects of gravitational lensing are explained. The lecture also describes current project designs for detecting supernovae at high or intermediate redshift, such as the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).","We had gotten, at the end of last time, to the Big Rip. All you know is that it’s expanding, and you can figure out how fast it’s expanding. Most of the matter, it turns out, is this weird dark matter, which we don’t understand, but that’s what’s responsible for the deceleration. The only physical explanation that’s been offered–well, many have been offered. Ah, how do you know it’s doing that particular shape? And that line, if you, then, transform redshift and distance–this is kind of a weird measure of distance–into scale factor and time. In fact, this is almost certain to change with time. So, if you have the same , but smaller , this would have to have been bigger in the past. So, now, what does this look like on our graphs? And so, the dotted lines are extrapolations based on the idea that the dark energy is the Cosmological Constant, and the dark matter behaves like matter ought to behave. And so, this is what you expect for Ω = .25; Ω= .75 at present. Because this is a very strong prediction of the model–that is to say that it should turn around. And you could hope to go and see things even further out. And it becomes harder to separate the light from the supernova and the light from the galaxy that it lives in. And so, most of the radiation is in the infrared, which is much harder to see from the ground, because everything glows in the infrared. There is a flaw in the way the space telescope is designed from the point of view of trying to do this experiment. And so, you only look at a tiny piece of the sky at once. But, nevertheless, you can see what’s going on. And then, it does definitely seem like it’s going down. At the, sort of, faint limit, you see abnormally bright things first. Because, suppose dark energy isn’t constant. So, these three lines, at about, you know, 0.8, are very, very close together. This is an example of one mission proposed to be JDEM. Is optimization for infrared or are there any other predicted, sort of, benefits of having  Oh, it’s very nice to look at the infrared, because anything at high redshift shines in the infrared. And there’s one other project, at least, which I’ll describe next week, that these guys are interested in doing, but there’s a real tradeoff between making it a general purpose telescope like the Hubble, or doing this one thing especially well."
64,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-23,"Reasons for the expansion of the universe are addressed at the start of this lecture, focusing especially on the acceleration of dark energy. Supernovae were the first evidence for the existence of dark energy. Two other proofs are presented. The first is the Cosmic Microwave Background, which is a form of electromagnetic radiation that is perfectly smooth and equal in all directions. It firmly supports the Big Bang theory. Projects attempting to measure it, such as COBE and WMAP, are discussed. Secondly, Large-Scale Clustering is introduced: by measuring the degree of clustering, astronomers hope to advance their understanding of dark energy and dark matter. Computer simulations of the evolution of the universe are shown.","We’ve been talking about the Type I Supernovae and the data that they provide about the expansion and, as it turns out, acceleration of the Universe. What I mean is that you don’t need a whole bunch of physics to understand what’s going on, because it’s just the expansion of the Universe, whereas some of these other things, as you will see, there’s moments where I’m going to have to say, and then there’s a whole bunch of complicated physics, and then, you get the result. You’re looking back in time as you look far away. And if you look back far enough, they get really hot. One of the features of ionized hydrogen, or indeed, charged particles, generally, is that they tend to be opaque. You can–let’s go outside and look up in some direction. There is a Cosmic Microwave Background in any direction. Take a microwave detector, radio telescope. It doesn’t matter if you go back in time looking that way, or back in time looking that way. So, 10 to 1.Now, that contrasts with the variations we see in the current Universe. That gives you confidence that you know what you’re talking about. And so, we’re moving in this direction, away from here, and that effect–it’s a very small effect of our motion through the Universe–turns out to dominate the irregularities in the Cosmic Microwave Background. And so, you can take out the ones–you can artificially, digitally, remove the objects that have the spectrum associated with galactic objects. So, let me just say that from the sizes, you can get cosmological information. So, this is from the Microwave Background. You have to get from these tiny perturbations that, after great effort, have been seen in the Cosmic Microwave Background, those had better grow up to be galaxies or groups of galaxies or something. But, of course, that action makes it denser, because it’s just pulled in more stuff from the nearby region, and it makes the other parts less dense. Turns out that the–even on the WMAP plot, the kinds of perturbations we’re looking at are what’s called large–this leads to the Large-Scale Structure, which is distributions of galaxies and galaxy clusters. They just don’t see all the galaxies, because there are faint ones that they can’t measure. But here is the evolution of the Universe as done by computer. Each one of these dots is supposed to be a galaxy. One is that the box is going to get thirty times bigger. See, it’s the same simulation, except the box is rotating, and so, you get a better sense, I think, of what these structures actually look like. It doesn’t actually measure either one of them. Then, you can, you know, quote what the values are, once you’ve done this, to however–whatever the precision of your measurement turns out to be. If you have three measurements of two variables, that’s a test of the theory, because it is not guaranteed that you’ll get a consistent result. And then, you have tested the theory because your prediction is that all these three lines cross at the same place. This is the allowed region of the supernovae."
65,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-24,"Professor Bailyn begins the class with a discussion of a recent New York Times article about the discovery of a new, earth-like planet. He then discusses concepts such as epicycles, dark energy and dark matter; imaginary ideas invented to explain 96% of the universe. The Anthropic Principle is introduced and the possibility of the multiverse is addressed. Finally, biological arguments are put forth for how complexity occurs on a cosmological scale. The lecture and course conclude with a discussion on the fine differences between science and philosophy.","Just in time for our last class, we get this in yesterday’s , and all over the rest of the media. “ We can figure out the absolute magnitude of this star. Well, we know how to do that, right?Let’s see, that looks–in the easiest format, it looks like this:  -  =  / . Here is a planet where liquid water could exist. You can be a junior or a senior scientist at one of several competing scientific institutions, or a member of the review committee that decides which projects to do. The review committee then gets to decide. So, this is where the supernovae observation kind of forces you to be. And so, the great thing about this was, if you will recall, that there were three different lines on a two-dimensional graph, and they all cross at the same point. And the first thing we found out is that the rotation of galaxies and other indicators of matter aren’t in accord with what we expect, so we invent dark matter to explain the internal motions of galaxies and galaxy clusters. It was also, I have to say, a little philosophically dubious, because if you want a new theory of gravity, you don’t want to go back to Newton and start over again. And it may be that in fifty years, these things will look like what we think about people who thought that the Earth was the center of the Universe. And what does that tell you about the Universe? Helium, you may remember from chemistry, is a noble gas. So, for example, supposing it were true that Ω, that’s the density of the dark energy, instead of being around .7, was greater than 100. So, we have no way of knowing what these numbers should be. Now, carbon of course, this fabulous substance, does all this wonderful chemistry. And so, just in that form, it’s not very interesting. But, of course, if it was any other license plate, you would have said the same thing. And so, you can imagine that there are kind of slow changes in the constants and laws of nature, and that by the time you’re 100 billion light years away from us, that part of the Universe, which is causally disconnected from our own, has some other kind of physics that is going on. Then, they do this clever thing where they say, of course, we live in a three-dimensional Universe, but it’s really a ten-dimensional Universe with seven dimensions rolled up so tight you can’t see them. This is presented in a popular book by a guy named Lee Smolin, which is a wonderful book. So, new Universes form from old ones, from black holes, or whatever. I mean, you need a set of physical laws, here, that tell you how different one Universe is from its parents. Other people argue that this is totally not science, because as soon as you are invoking Universes other than our own, you’ve left the realm of science, by definition. Just between you, me, and the video camera back there, it’s just not true that things that aren’t science aren’t worth thinking about. And my own personal view of this argument is that this is one of them–that this really isn’t science. A hundred years ago, the idea that you could say anything scientific about the Universe as a whole was completely preposterous."
66,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-2,"Exoplanets are introduced and students learn how astronomers detect their presence as well as the challenges associated with it. Physics equations are explained as well as their importance in the context of the course. A number of problems are worked out to get students used to dealing with large numbers in calculating planetary masses, interplanetary distances, etc.Professor Bailyn’s guide to Extrasolar Planet Websites","The syllabus, if you haven’t got it yet, is on the classes server. We have extra copies but I have to say I don’t know where they are, and in any case, everything that you need to know is on the classes server and there’s actually more than is on the printed syllabus there anywhere. I think we’ve got plenty of sections to accommodate everyone in here, provided you’re not a science major. Sections will start–sections are going to be on Mondays, so they obviously won’t start next week they’ll start the following week. The purpose of problem sets is different from the purpose of a take-home test. We can find a time, same with the teaching assistants. And it’s only a very recent development that there’s any actual evidence that these things exist. The reason it’s extended is for two reasons; first of all, the atmosphere distorts–this was a ground-based picture, the atmosphere distorts how you see the star, and in particular, it’s like looking up from the bottom of a swimming pool. Plus also, the optics of the telescope aren’t perfect, and these spiky things here are due to the optics of the telescope. So, the combination of optics and atmosphere sort of spreads out the light by a whole bunch. This is another star somewhat fainter than this . And this [a] is–orbits you will recall are ellipses, and this is the so-called semi-major axis of the ellipse in units called Astronomical Units, which is the distance from the Earth to the Sun. So, don’t freak out, that’s the first thing. If you know  and  you can compute , right? All right, so now, turns out an Astronomical Unit is expressed in meters is 150 billion meters, approximately. If I threw two coins or six coins, or seven coins you’ll probably be okay. N is a number between one and nine, m is an integer, it’s one of those numbers four, five, six that we can get our minds wrapped around. So, that’s the point of scientific notation, it’s to take big numbers and allow us to deal with them. So, a specific example of this might be N times 10, the square root of that which is raising something to the ½ power. So, I’ve just moved a 10 from here over to here, and then that is equal to 10 N to the ½ times 10. So, let’s see, 1.5 times 10; that’s an astronomical unit cubed. I did my little calculation to come up with one year equals 3 times 10 seconds. But if you start coming up with numbers like 7.1516397, that’s eight digits of accuracy and I’m pretty sure you haven’t worked it out yourself. You do it in your head in scientific notation and you figure out whether the answer is meaningful or not. So, this shows up in science fiction too. What is the distance from one side of the Moon to the other? So, this observer is looking at this star-planet system. And once again, you have to be careful of the units. Around a star 3 parsecs away;  means parsecs, whatever they may tell you in the humanities classes. And you don’t have to actually know anything about anything in order to do that; you just have to have a good set of notes. This is a hard problem for another reason, which is that I haven’t told you something important. Most of the mass is in the mass of the star."
67,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-3,"Class begins with a review of the first problem set. Newton’s Third Law is applied in explaining how exoplanets are found. An overview of the Solar System is given; each planet is presented individually and its special features are highlighted. Astronomy is discussed as an observational science, and the subject of how to categorize objects in the Solar System is addressed. The Pluto controversy is given special attention and both sides of the argument regarding its status are considered.","Okay now, we didn’t have sections this week, in case you didn’t notice, and therefore you didn’t have an opportunity to discuss the problem set during section. I think there might be some difficulty with the last one. The point here as I’ve written down on the actual paper itself–there’s no right answer to this. And I keep asking these sort of touchy-feely, humanities kinds of questions. This, technically speaking, makes this a vector quantity, but again, we won’t go there. And here’s the whole trick about finding exoplanets, and that is that the star moves too. Here’s the distance of the star to the planet of mass. And the whole point of this is that this is a large quantity compared to the mass of the planet, and therefore these are small quantities compared to the distances and velocities taken by the planet. This is the innermost planet, this is the planet Mercury. There was a time when we thought that its spin period was exactly the same as its orbital period, so it keeps one face to the Sun. It’s entirely artificially colored, right? Here is a map of the whole of Venus made by these orbiting missions. I’m not going to say anymore about it, therefore, oh, except for one thing: it comes with this companion object. These blotchy things here turn out to change with time. And this is basically what the surface of Mars looks like. And this looks very much like river deltas. And that’s important, because it is thought that the existence of life as we know it is dependent on the existence of liquid water. And so now, people are thinking, maybe there is something flowing around on Mars, although clearly not all that much of it. Jupiter has moons, many of them–these–the four big ones you see here are the so-called “Galilean” moons, because they were discovered by Galileo. It’s actually kind of a mystery how come Neptune has all this weather, because it’s very cold out there. This is three pictures, sort of shown as a movie. This is the one that for a while was called Xena, now it’s called Eris. And then people decided, you know, the heck with this whole bunch of things. We’ll give them a different name; we won’t call them planets at all. And that was what was finally determined, leading to all sorts of, you know, “Save Pluto” campaigns from disgruntled third-graders who– yes, thank you very much–who were unhappy about having to re-memorize all the mnemonics that tell you the planets in the Solar System. Here’s Pluto, and you’ll notice that Pluto really is an elliptical orbit, much more elliptical than the other planets. Comets cause all kinds of mayhem, they kill dinosaurs, for example, and recently we’ve seen an example of this. Okay, this is the Outer Solar System again. So, I claim, or at least, it’s the start of a good story, that there are six categories of objects in the Solar System. And they’re in basically circular orbits. And all these orbits, both these planets and these planets are basically in one plane."
68,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-4,"The formation of planets is discussed with a special emphasis on the bodies in the Solar System. Planetary differences between the celestial bodies in the Inner and Outer Solar System are observed. Professor Bailyn explains how the outlook of our Solar System can predict what other star systems may look like. It is demonstrated how momentum equations are applied in astronomers’ search for exoplanets. Planet velocities are discussed and compared in relation to a planet’s mass. Finally, the Doppler shift is introduced and students learn how it is used to measure the velocity of distant objects, such as galaxies and planets.","We were talking last time about the objects in the Solar System. And let’s try for an explanation of those particular features. This is one of the foremost examples of a word that means something different when scientists use it than when normal people use it. So, this is a side view, and in the top view, all these things are in orbit here. And so the planets are only the rocky parts. So, this is interesting because it makes a prediction about how other Solar Systems ought to look. That planetary systems–there should be a general feature, because there’s nothing of what I’ve said so far that’s unique to the Sun. And so you can only really define what the overall velocity of the thing is, if you’ve got a nearly circular orbit. But in that case, as is true for planets, this 2π over  gives you a value for velocity. So, it goes around 15 kilometers per second, that’s 1.5 x 10 meters per second. Velocity of Jupiter times the mass of Jupiter is equal to the velocity of the Sun times the mass of the Sun. We’ll come back to how that’s done in a minute. Now, you might think is going to be bigger, because the velocity of Earth is bigger than the velocity of Jupiter. And so the overall effect is that the  is going to be smaller,  / . Mass of the Earth, as it turns out, is 6 x 10 meters per second. So, we have a situation, and this is what was happening about ten years ago, where instruments had been developed that could, in principle, see the reflex motion of stars due to planets like Jupiter, but weren’t yet capable of seeing the motion of stars due to planets like Earth. And so, because the waves are emitted at different places, the wave fronts here–I’ll wait until this cycle goes through again. And how fast is it coming towards you and how fast is it moving away from you? Second of all, be wary of this a little bit because there is, in fact, a change to the equation that happens when you’re going close to the speed of light, and we’ll talk about that when we get to relativity. And so this is just an example of how this works out. The amplitude of this sine wave is something to do with the overall velocity, because that’s the maximum velocity it has coming towards you. This is exactly what you expect to see for a planet. And so, this is 150 kilometers a second if you prefer those units. It seems clear that one of the two things must be true."
69,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-5,"Professor Bailyn talks about student responses for a paper assignment on the controversy over Pluto. The central question is whether the popular debate is indeed a “scientific controversy.” A number of scientific “fables” are discussed and a moral is associated with each: the demotion of Pluto (moral: science can be affected by culture); the discovery of 51 Peg b (morals: expect the unexpected, and look at your data); the disproof of pulsation as explanation for the Velocity Curves (moral: sometimes science works like science).","I have spent a very enjoyable weekend reading your Pluto comments. There are technical issues about how orbits of planets work. And that is fundamentally not a scientific thing, and you could argue that that’s the whole root of the entire issue. And so he objected on scientific grounds to this definition. And, I have to say, I don’t agree with that. So the–it’s–and then, you can redefine the coordinate system so it doesn’t move in some other coordinate system. But it doesn’t go around in circles or ellipses or anything. And so the star has to stay exactly opposite to the planet. Because again, the center of mass is still a fixed point, even when you’ve got two planets ‒ and so one of the things–so the star is going around the center of mass because of this planet, but it’s taking other extra little wiggles as a result–if there’s a second planet, as a result of that planet. And you can see that the sine curve more or less goes through these points, which is nice because that indicates the presence of a planet. And so it’s neither coming toward you nor going away from you. So there are now several examples of things in which we know that there’s actually more than one planet in one of these systems. But, of course, you don’t observe the velocity of the planet–you observe the velocity of the star. And the way this worked out was, there was a team of astronomers, Geoff Marcy and Paul Butler, chief among them, in California, who had the best equipment for doing these kinds of very high-precision radial velocity measurements. Because they hadn’t been looking for ten years yet. Both of those factors make for large values of the thing that you’re actually trying to observe, which is the velocity of the star. Double stars don’t form–the second star doesn’t necessarily form out of a disk around the first star. Problem number one, no evidence for light from more than one star. The other problem is a kind of statistical one. Here it is when it’s small but getting bigger. And this, by the way, is how you can determine what stars are made out of–determine composition of stars. So–can measure these wavelengths at rest in a lab. And so you know in advance what the rest wavelengths of these things are. Part of the star moves away from you, but part of the star moves sideways. And so what you do is you get something that looks more like this. Hypothesis two, it does not change its shape. And so this is yet another fable, “The Disproof of Pulsation as Explanation for the Velocity Curves.” ”So there were, for several years, all of these attempts to try and explain the Hot Jupiter, the radial velocity curves, without actually having to bite the bullet and believe that Hot Jupiters exist."
70,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-6,"The class begins with a discussion on transits – important astronomical events that help astronomers to find new planets. The event occurs when a celestial body moves across the face of the star it revolves around and blocks some of its light. By calculating the amount of light that is being obscured astronomers can obtain important information about both star and planet, such as size, density, radial velocity and more. The concept of planetary migration is explained in order to better understand the dramatic differences between bodies in the Inner and Outer Solar System. Finally, potential problems in the Solar System that may occur as a result of migration are addressed.","You’ll recall that where we got to last time is that there are lots of Hot Jupiters; lots of Hot Jupiters. You find some kind of fairly strong evidence for something, but it would be way stronger if you found two different kinds of evidence. And, at a certain point along the way, about six years ago or so, a new kind of evidence for the existence of these planets was discovered. All right, so let me explain what’s plotted here. So, stars, if you look at the Sun for example, the edges of the Sun look a little fainter than the middle. But, if you have such an alignment, you know how these dips ought to line up with the radial velocity curve. So, you can predict what the radial velocity has to be at the particular moment where the transit occurs. Not only is it moving the star back and forth the way you expect a planet to do, it’s also passing in front of that star at exactly the moment you expect it to pass in front of the star, and the shape of the dip that it creates is exactly what you would expect if you pass an opaque disc in front of a star. And so I would say that this, plus this, plus the shape of the–of the spectral lines, which we talked about last time, plus the shape of these dips–that’s proof way beyond a reasonable doubt that there’s a planet around this particular star. And so, you can figure out exactly what the trajectory across the thing is. And in this case, you can figure out that the angle of the inclination, so-called, which is 90 degrees if it’s exactly edge-on, is 80–I think 88 point something, I don’t remember the answer. Have we ever discovered a planet through transit without having discovered it previously? And so, most stars with planets–this doesn’t happen. And so, there are a million stars packed into the space where only one star exists in our corner of the galaxy. And the only way you get to keep your hydrogen and helium, the 98% of the stuff that’s hydrogen and helium, is if you already have a big core of heavier–either rocks, or ice, or something else–if you already have some metallic, in the astronomical sense, core. However, having done that, it was clear what the next experiment had to be: that you wanted to go out and try and measure these transits in some region that’s a little less dense, and a whole lot more metal rich. I should say, there are a couple of others that have been discovered. And density is defined as mass of something divided by its volume. You have to specify the temperature, too, because–but, so, that’s a typical density of water, which is on ice, right?Rocks have higher density–much higher density. So, if you know the density, you can tell something about the composition of the planet. This is not a good place to put a snowball, all right? And so the idea–the current thinking on this is an idea called migration. Now, one thing, a consequence of this idea, is that there are no terrestrial planets. There might still be a substantial residual gas and dust disc. And if it were clear, you would have predicted it to happen. Because, Jupiter in our Solar System is where Jupiter is. All right, that’s as much as we know about it."
71,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-7,"Class begins with a problem on transits and learning what information astronomers obtain through observing them. For example, radii of stars can be estimated. Furthermore, applying the Doppler shift method, one can find the mass of a star. Finally, a star’s density can be calculated. A second method for identifying planets around stars is introduced: the astrometry method. The method allows for an extremely accurate assessment of a star’s precise position in the sky. Special features of the astrometry method are discussed and a number of problems are solved. A short summary is given on the three methods astronomers use to identify exoplanets. Class ends with an overview of upcoming space missions and the hope of detecting the presence of biological activity on other planet.","So, we’ve been talking about transits and I want to say a couple things more just to round out that discussion. And so, what you see, basically, although you’re too far away to see it in this kind of detail, looks something like this. So, it looks like you have a little spot there. And so, the depth of such a transit is the square of the ratios of these radii.(7 x 10) / (7 x 10)That’s (10 ) = 10 , or 0.01%.So, that’s a lot less than what you found in section yesterday for a Jupiter-like planet. And so, basically, observing a transit is a way to get the radius of the star. The radius of the Earth we just figured out, 7 x 10 meters. And so this, then, in turn, is equal to (6 x 10) / (1.4 x 10) because this is 1.4 x 10 x 10.6 / 1.4 = 4, give or take, times 10. There have been lots of planets discovered by the radial velocity method. How big a change in the Sun’s position due to the planet Jupiter, because that’s the most massive and will make the most difference, would you see if you’re on Alpha Centauri?–would an Alpha Centauri astronomer observe? And we want the angular change in position, because that’s what we mean when we make a position measurement in space. And the Sun is doing a little circuit in the other direction, always making sure that it’s on the other side of the center of mass from the planet. You can do this backwards and you get exactly the same answer, because Alpha Centauri is a Sun-like star, has exactly the same mass, and we don’t observe any such motion in Alpha Cen. This is not observable, at least not with current technology. So, our friends on Alpha Centauri, who know that there’s Jupiter, don’t yet know that Earth exists, because this is so much smaller than the effect due to Jupiter. And it’s smaller for two different reasons. The bigger the orbit, the bigger the motion of both the star and the planet. So, even once you figure it out, how much the star moves, you’ve got to divide by the distance of the star. These are what kinds of things are easy to see and what kinds of things are not so easy to see for a given method. We’ll cycle back and talk about this later on in the course. But isn’t the star going  Yes, so the star travels a circle with radius , so you’re right. It goes from one side to the other, so the distance the star goes is actually 2 And so that’s just a definition question of– But is it–can’t you observe the star at one point or another? So, this is fundamentally different from everything else. We’re actually going to look at the planet itself. And there are a couple of different ways you can do it. There are also more sophisticated optical methods–something called interferometry, which I won’t explain right now, which can have the same effect of nulling out the light from the star. They sent it not outward toward Jupiter, but inward toward Venus. You need to have very high resolution; you need to be able to separate the light from the star, from the light from the planet, to the greatest extent possible."
72,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-8,"The second half of the course begins, focusing on black holes and relativity. In introducing black holes, Professor Bailyn offers a definition, talks about how their existence is detected, and explains why (unlike in the case with exoplanets where Newtonian physics was applied) Einstein’s Theory of Relativity is now required when studying black holes. The concepts of escape and circular velocity are introduced. A number of problems are worked out and students learn how to calculate an object’s escape velocity. A historical overview is offered of our understanding and discovery of black holes in the context of stellar evolution.","Okay, welcome to the second part of Astro 160. This is going to be about black holes and relativity. There is an equation associated with this. You continue all the way out to infinity. The escape velocity of Earth–that would be–the escape is (2 / ).2 = 7 x 10 is, for the Earth, is 6 x 10 for the Earth is something like 7 x 10. Let’s see, 12 x 10.24 - 11 over 10½–let’s see, that’s 1.2.14 - 6 = 8, times 10, to the ½. That’s something like 10 meters per second, because I’ve used the value of  that’s appropriate for meters per second. Let’s see,  is equal to 2 over–a half–there’s a very famous book about physics with the title, “Assume A Spherical Cow,” and this–so, this is the kind of thing that physicists like to do. And so, you can do this calculation for any given object. So as I say, this was worked out in obscurity in the middle of the eighteenth century, and nobody thought anything much about it. So, this is one of these kinds of historical fables that we’ve hit a couple of times. So, something that looks quite unimportant for a long time can all of a sudden become a very big deal. Because there’s no solid surface to prevent it from doing so. And the inner regions of the star exert a pressure outward. And that requires that the pressure on the inside has to be bigger than the pressure on the outside, because you don’t have negative gravity; at least, not until the third part of this course. Now, it turns out that if you just keep the temperature constant all the way through the star, you never achieve this balance. The heat will come out of that piece of lead. So, the heat in the center of the star flows out. It does no good for the energy to be created all the way through the star, because if it’s created all the way through the star, then the temperature is distributed throughout the star and you don’t get a situation where it’s much hotter in the middle than it is on the outside. And then the star has many adventures before it settles down. Suffice it to say that you know in advance what the outcome has to be, because there’s no way it can hold itself up, in the long run, because it doesn’t have an energy source down at the center of the star. Degeneracy is another one of those words that means something different to physicists than they do to ordinary, normal people. It’s got to get rid of its electrons, because the problem is, the way this electron degeneracy pressure works–you can’t squeeze electrons any closer together than they are in a white dwarf. Astronomers call these things neutron stars, and they exist."
73,astronomy,astr-160,lecture-9,"The discussion of black holes continues with an introduction of the concept of event horizon. A number of problems are worked out to familiarize students with mathematics related to black hole event horizons. In a longer question and answer session, Professor Bailyn discusses the more mystifying aspects of the nature of black holes and the possibility of time travel. Finally, the issues of reconciling Newton’s laws of motion with Special Relativity, and Newton’s law of gravity with General Relativity, are addressed.","Okay, let’s start–let’s see, we started talking about black holes last time, and there’s now going to be a problem set that is going to be available later today, due next week. And, we’ll talk in a minute about how all this arises, but one of the interesting things about the speed of light is that you can’t go any faster. And this is the sphere where the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light. And the reason it’s called that is because, if nothing can go faster than the speed of light, what it means is that any event that takes place inside this imaginary sphere can’t radiate any information about what’s going on to the outside, because this–the escape velocity’s greater than the speed of light. You can’t detect anything that goes on inside. And so, the way you have to think about the Universe is as a kind of Swiss cheese. Even in principle, un-testable, because you can’t ever get any information about what’s going on in there to see if those really are the right equations. So you can’t–by expending energy, you can’t hold yourself up inside a singularity, so everything collapses. In an ordinary situation, we can move around in space. And, as I said, you can expend a lot of energy but it doesn’t change your trajectory in space. And there is, to this day, some dispute over whether that will turn out to be true, in general, or not. Give me some science jargon so that–that will make this work. And we’ll get back to that in a little while. And that behavior is reversed between space and time inside the event horizon. And this is a question that cannot only be asked, but answered. Where does all the mass go when it collapses? But aside from that, the orbit of the Earth–if the Sun turned into a black hole of the same mass as the Earth, the orbit of the Earth wouldn’t change, because we’re far enough away that it just seems like any other mass down there. If there’s nothing to–think about what we were talking about, hydrostatic equilibrium, the other day. Relativity does not incorporate quantum mechanics. And so, it is likely that there are physical effects that we don’t understand at the quantum level before you get to precisely the same point–but we don’t know what they are, because that would require a theory that encompasses special–general relativity and quantum mechanics at the same time. But I agree that it might not be the best wording one could use. They ought to have a particular amount of mass. Then there are the so-called supermassive black holes, which are the masses of whole galaxies, and those are the kinds of black holes for which we have direct evidence at the moment. And just to jump ahead a little bit–the condition is, there’s a quantity–so, now I’m going to talk, first, about special relativity. You can’t go faster than the speed of light. So, it turns out, for example, in relativistic physics, that mass isn’t exactly what Newton thought mass was. I’ll talk about the history of this next time, but basically it was–Einstein revised the Laws of Motion in response to some experiments, which weren’t giving the right Newtonian answer. Because as you get closer and closer to the speed of light, this gamma factor becomes larger and larger. If you’re not moving at the speed of light, then this isn’t infinite. Remember, acceleration is a change in velocity by applying force."
74,astronomy,astr-160,update-1,"In this first of three update lectures, Prof. Bailyn discusses new information relevant to the first part of the course, on exoplanets. In particular, Prof. Bailyn reviews the spectacular results from the Kepler mission, launched in 2009, which has discovered thousands of new exoplanets. Examples of these results are discussed, but the long-term goal of discovering Earth-like planets on which life as we know it could thrive has still not quite been achieved.","It’s been over five years since the lectures for Frontiers and Controversies in Astrophysics were recorded. And so the star doesn’t move very fast because it’s much more massive than the planet itself, moves only 50 m/s or so, which in astronomical terms, is actually quite slow. You may not be able to read this scale here. ”This is the part of the solar system that is not too cold, not too hot, but just right for life. And this line here is a model of how a planet should behave, and so, they inferred the presence of one of these Hot Jupiters. And you can see how much better it is to be observing from space than it is to be observing from the ground. Then, an interesting thing happens at the exact opposite phase, namely. And so, this is kind of the family gallery of planets, and they keep adding to this picture. They’ve found some very spectacular things, here’s one. This is a newly popular thing to do with big, scientific data sets. We found things that are as small, or smaller, than the Earth. We have not yet found something that is both as small as the Earth, and in the Goldilocks Zone. And when you have that, you can have a coincidence where a sun spot appears on the surface of the sun–that makes the star look a little dimmer–and if it just so happens that another spot appears at exactly a year later, and a year later than that, or whatever, they can accidentally line up and give you the impression that there’s an Earth-like star–an Earth-like planet around that star."
75,astronomy,astr-160,update-2,"In this second of three update lectures, Prof. Bailyn discusses new information pertaining to the second part of the course, on black holes. In this lecture Prof. Bailyn describes recent work by he and his colleagues on determining the spin of black holes, which is the only parameter of consequence other than the mass. The results of these investigations are currently ambiguous and controversial.","Welcome to the second update lecture of Frontiers and Controversies in Astrophysics. And so what I thought I would do in this particular lecture is talk about what we are doing now, now that what we were doing 20 years ago has become basically straight forward. These jets can go at a very substantial fraction of the speed of light, relativistic jets, and it is one of the hypotheses about how those jets are organized is if the black hole is spinning fast enough; it kind of winds up space-time into a sort of nozzle, and stuff shoots out the pole. And it’s that fact that allows us to try to measure how fast it’s spinning; you look for where the innermost stable circular orbit is, and I’ll come back to exactly how we do that in a minute. This is to scale–here’s the Sun and Mercury, just to give you a sense of scale. Some of these are pointed toward us, some of these are edge on, and so forth. But, if you have a black hole spinning as fast as it can, then you can have an innermost stable orbit all the way down to one Schwarzschild radius, provided the material is orbiting in the same direction as the black hole. But, if it’s spinning close to the maximum–the maximum this parameter can get to be is one–then, it goes all the way down into the middle and it’s much, much brighter. And so, the idea is, we go and look at the discs of these things, see how bright they are, and thus, figure out how fast the black hole must be spinning. So, determining the mass, as I said, comes from looking at the radial velocity curve, just like we looked at the radial velocity curves of stars with planets going around them. But if you really want a number, you have to do something more. And twice per orbit, when you’re looking at the end, you’ll see less light. The line through there is actually a model of the ellipsoidal variation for a particular inclination, in this case 70 degrees, and it agrees really very well. So, these are typical results; this is actually the best we have. Scientists spend most of their time being confused. But the fact that that’s a problem, doesn’t mean that we don’t know anything about anything."
76,astronomy,astr-160,update-3,"In this third of three update lectures, Prof. Bailyn provides new information pertaining to the third part of the course, on cosmology. The basic model of the Universe, including Dark Matter and Dark Energy, is supported by all recent evidence. Work is thus beginning on sorting out the consequences of this model, in particular the growth of structure in the Universe, from tiny modulations of the Cosmic Microwave Background to the current distribution of galaxies.","This is the third update lecture for Frontiers and Controversies in Astrophysics. And what this is is it plots the amount of dark energy in the universe vs. the amount of dark matter in the universe; and each one of these different colors is a different way of constraining the dark matter and the dark energy. And the discovery that the supernova evidence showed that the universe was expanding faster as time went on, rather than slower, that was what was discovered in 1998, and it began this change in our view of what the universe consisted of. And so, the remarkable thing turns out to be that there are these three ways of measuring how much dark matter and energy there is, each one of which defines a line in this graph. For two generations, people argued about whether this number was 50 or 100. And it’s really quite remarkable we have that to several decimal places now. And, you could have picked a whole bunch of people on this side. And then, two things–and then you do a computer model which includes two different effects. And so, what they do is they’re changing the scale as it goes along to keep the box the same size. And this is a particular range of initial perturbations and a particular cosmology; and people are amusing themselves by doing this kind of calculation over and over again on the current day super computers. You see glowing gas; that’s what we observe. Stars, nebulae, things of this nature–those are all Baryons, that’s this little extra stuff that rides along with the cold dark matter. You need the biggest, most powerful telescopes to observe them. It will look really powerfully and distantly at this. But we can, and so, we have this concordance cosmology, which really seems to be true, but we don’t understand the details of the things the universe contains. We don’t know what the dark matter is, we don’t know what the dark energy is, we haven’t mapped the clumping of the gas during the dark ages, and we don’t understand the gastrophysics of the radiating objects–the stars and galaxies themselves."
77,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-10,"Professor Saltzman continues his presentation on the topic of vaccine. First, Professor Saltzman describes the host immune response to pathogen recognition, in terms of immunoglobulin release, T-cell activation, and memory cell production. The production, distribution, and challenges involved in making of the Salk polio vaccine and the modern, oral polio vaccine are discussed. Professor Saltzman then talks about the range of bioengineering approaches that can be used to produce vaccine: attenuated, subunit, and DNA-based. Finally, a life-intervention cost analysis (cost of technology per human life saved) for vaccine was compared to other policies to further emphasize the impact of vaccine on improving public health worldwide.","Great, well welcome, today we’re going to continue talking about vaccines. That will lead us into a discussion of sort of modern methods and sort of the spectrum of methods that are available now for vaccine development. Here, I’ve just picked a couple of the pictures that I showed you last time when we were talking about cell communication in the immune system, What happens after the vaccine is introduced into your body is that it initiates cellular events. In this case, it might be a piece of a virus that’s replicating inside this cell. But this antigen presenting cell is more likely a professional antigen presenting cell, or a subset of cells of your immune system that are specialized in ingesting foreign particles and displaying their contents to the rest of the immune system. Now, if I was a person that was designing a vaccine and I noticed that this was the response that it got, that antibodies were produced, they reached some intermediate level, they started to fall, I would say, ‘well I haven’t stimulated the immune system enough, let me re-boost, let me give another dose of antigen. ‘ If we did the experiment where on this booster we included not only the initial antigen but some unrelated antigen, the response to the unrelated antigen called B here, looks like a primary response. Because on second exposure there’s another population of cells that I haven’t mentioned before that remain after the primary exposure and those are called memory cells, they’re down here. Memory cells are long lasting cells that remember this exposure and can respond very quickly on second exposure. We talked about antibodies, we talked about them two weeks ago, we talked about them in section last week, uses of them. If you just introduced this polio virus, which you could make in large quantities into people now, you would be causing polio. Remember that the lucky thing about the smallpox vaccine was that a naturally occurring attenuated form of the smallpox virus  called was found. They grew the virus in monkey cell cultures, they purified the virus because you got to get all the other stuff from the cells that you’re growing it in a way, they inactivated it by treating it with formalin which is just a formula–it’s just a mixture of Formaldehyde; Formaldehyde cross links proteins. Then, they did preliminary studies of safety and effectiveness in people. If you’re trying to prevent a disease that only occurs at a rate of 20 per 100,000 people you have to give the vaccine to millions in order to see if the number goes down. Well, you know that was possible at this time for a couple of reasons. Well, this shows what happened in the period after this vaccine was introduced into the general population so that would have been in 1954.This is a complex slide, so let me show you what it is. As those doses were given you look at the prevalence of polio within the United States. This led people to go back and look at the places that were manufacturing the vaccine to make sure that they were all producing vaccine of the proper quality. Plus it makes it, as I talked about last time, much easier to think about distributing the vaccine around the world because shots require skilled medical personnel, whereas, an oral vaccine could be self-administered. Turns out that that hasn’t been a problem. They’re all over each other sometimes and they can spread saliva or other fluids. One is the resources that are needed in order to do this. This might be a polio virus, for example. That is, mix it with things which make it more–make your immune system respond more strongly. I didn’t have the commercial price for the chickenpox vaccine called Varivax but you can imagine that it’s even more than $50 a dose for that one. So, it saves money, you’re saving money by doing it, not that it’s not costing you."
78,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-11,"Professor Saltzman starts the lecture with an introduction to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Professor Saltzman talks about the concept of dose-response. He introduces different routes of drug administration and how they affect drug distribution and bioavailability (i.e., intravenous, oral, and sublingual routes). First-pass drug metabolism by the liver is also identified as an important source of drug degradation. Finally, modeling the body as a well-stirred vessel, Professor Saltzman explains the first-order rate equation: C = (/)*, that can be used calculate the amount of drug in the body (M) as a function of time () and a rate constant (); and the equation for drug half-life:  = ln(/).","So, this week we’re going to talk about drug delivery, this is Chapter 14. What I want to do today, Thursday, and then we’ll continue in section is today I’m going to sort of set up the problem, talk about some definitions to think about, if one is building drug delivery systems, think about some basic concepts in drug delivery. Pharmacology is the science of dealing with these interactions of molecules that are introduced into the body. The first thing you do is you might have cultured tumor cells and you expose those cells to different concentrations of the drug and you see at what dose do I begin to see cell death or killing of the tumor cells. That’s the easiest way to think about it. Bioavailability is going to depend on how we administer the drug. The main effect of changing the route of administration is to change the bioavailability or how much of the drug actually reaches the active sites. Often, that conversion of a drug into something else is an important part of how your body gets rid of a drug. If you can deliver more at the site of action then less of it goes to the rest of the body where it might cause unwanted effects, so that’s a very good reason to target it. Why else might drugs be administered in different ways? It needs to act very quickly and the way that you administer it has as big effect on how rapidly concentrations in the body rise. There’s another issue with insulin which we’ll come too, keep that one in mind. The advantages of that should be obvious. Now, usually we think about bioavailability as the fraction of the drug that ends up in the blood and you might say, ‘well but that might not be where the drug acts’. If you’re introducing all the drug at one time intravenously the potential for an unwanted response is higher. If you were a diabetic patient and you needed insulin what would you prefer to do? If a protein is a drug, you need it to enter the bloodstream without being broken down. So, if you had to pay two times as much because you lost half of it, because it was degraded before it got absorbed, that might be okay. This is a common mode of administration for nitroglycerin. So, by sending all those molecules that are absorbed from the intestine to the liver first, you get a jump start on processing of these molecules into the substrates that you need for life. That’s a really good set up for nutrition, but I also mentioned, remember that biotransformation or breakdown of drugs often occurs in the liver. Well, it turns out that the blood supply to the membranes in your mouth don’t go to the liver, it’s unusual. They avoid going to the liver the first time and that’s called, here on this graph, avoiding first-pass metabolism in the liver. We’re going to describe that in our simple model by having an arrow pointing out that tells you how–that tells you that drugs are eliminated when they’re within your body. Means that the rate at which the drug is eliminated is proportional to concentration to the first-power or linear with concentration. What this graph shows you here is just plotted on a semi-log plot."
79,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-12,"Professor Saltzman reviews the pharmacokinetic first-order rate equation that can be used to model changes in drug concentration in the blood, as well as its derivation from the law of conservation of mass. The importance of maintaining a drug concentration that is sufficient for therapeutic purpose, but below a toxic level, is emphasized. Since this is directly affected by drug administration method, ways to localize and sustain therapeutic concentrations of drug, such as incorporating in slow-releasing, biocompatible polymers are introduced. Professor Saltzman gave some examples of clinical applications of controlled release drug delivery system, such as anti-restenosis drug incorporated into stents, and chemotherapeutic drugs in brain implants and microspheres.","Welcome, so we’re going to continue today talking about drug delivery. I want to pick up where I started last time, where at the end of the class I was trying to convince you that one way to think about drug delivery was to take what we know is a complex system, the human body, and represent in a simple way. The amount that comes in minus the amount that goes out, plus any molecules that are generated inside, minus any molecules that are consumed inside the system has to be equal to accumulation. For many drugs the way that they’re eliminated from the body does result in first-order elimination like this, so you see this pattern. It doesn’t matter where you start at, for processes where you have first-order elimination the time to get rid of half of the drugs that are remaining is always the same. That’ll be more clear in just a moment, I hope. How could I extend this to talk about–to think about other situations as well? That means if this is most of your body, now when I take a pill I’m not introducing the drugs all at once, but I’m putting them into my intestinal system and they’re being slowly absorbed into the body. The patient’s going to swallow it and then that drug will be available in a particular sub-compartment of the body. Those are ones that you have to be more careful with; those are ones that physicians don’t want to prescribe unless they’re seeing you frequently enough that they can monitor how well you’re doing with the drug. It’s a millimeter or so in depth; several millimeters in diameter. It’s a solid polymer, but inside of it are particles of the drug that you want to deliver. What these graphs show are experiments that we did - this was back in the late 1980s, where we put drug molecules into these polymers and then just dropped them into a test tube and ask the question, ‘Could we release drugs slowly from these implants so we could make a long lasting pill essentially, make a long lasting implant that slowly released drugs?’This shows for a drug that is used to treat Parkinson’s disease, another sort of chronic indication, where patients have to take drugs everyday for the rest of their life. Plasmid DNA, these are big molecules; very difficult to administer. A shrunken version of this stent, shrunken only in its diameter being reduced, is then put into your body. Often that scar formation will occur so aggressively that scar tissue starts to fill in the vessel where–that you’ve opened, and this process is called restenosis. You can deliver drugs locally, you can prevent side effects that would happen in other places. In other situations you might want to introduce an implant but you don’t want the implant to last forever. You could load them in such a way that if you put this material into water that chemotherapy drugs would be slowly released. By three months later, or four months later, the whole device has disappeared. This is a different strategy for drug delivery. If we could make the particles better, such that they worked for three months, that makes it even more possible. These are particles that are made of a degradable polymer. These particular particles were made by a graduate student who worked with named Amarilys Sanchez, and Amarilys was able to put 20% by weight of a chemotherapy drug inside these very tiny particles, particles the size of a virus. Even though the particles are very tiny the drug comes out relatively slowly over a period of about a week."
80,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-13,"Professor Saltzman discusses the biophysics of the circulatory system. He begins by describing the anatomy of different types of blood vessels, and states the relationship between pressure difference (ΔP) as the driving force for fluid flow (Q) in a tube (i.e., blood vessel) with some resistance R (ΔP = RQ). R can be calculated using if dimensions of the tube () and fluid viscosity () are known: . Next, Professor Saltzman traces the blood flow through the circulatory system and explains how the body can regulate blood flow to specific regions of the body. Finally, he describes the heart and its function as the pressure generator in the system.","This week we’re going to talk about cardiovascular physiology and the cardiovascular system, which includes the blood, the blood vessels, and the heart. One of the most amazing things about the cardiovascular system is its ability to change the pattern of blood’s flow such that organs that need more blood can get more blood. You start at one point and you go around and you come back to the beginning again. Also, blood goes down through the abdominal aorta, so it splits in two directions down the abdominal aorta, That blood goes to your legs and all of your visceral organs that are below the heart. A pattern of flow, branch, branch, branch to ever smaller branches so that you can serve ever smaller regions of tissue. Well, you know the rest of the story; the capillaries merge after they leave the tissue area. Now, we usually show these blue colored vessels, usually show them as red and blue, indicating lots of oxygen red, not very much oxygen blue. The second is the pulmonary vascular system which is–the force is generated by the right side of the heart, the flow is generated by the right side of the heart, flows only to the blood–to the lungs and oxygenated blood comes back to the left side, so it’s sort of like a figure 8; one loop, a second loop. Circuits–it’s the flow through an electrical circuit. You would know if I have a pressure drop of so many units, this is the flow that would result. Two things about it in our vascular systems, the flow rates are generally low enough that you don’t have worry about that. It tells us that resistance varies with viscosity, length, and radius and it varies in kind of the way that you would expect. 1 Atmosphere (atm); atmosphere is another pressure, so relative to atmospheric pressure and if you have a–any others? We’re going to talk about where those numbers–where those pressures actually exist in a few minutes but that’s the range of pressures in your circulatory system from 0 mmHg up to 120 mmHg; roughly and we’ll see you go outside that range sometimes. When you say your blood pressure is 120/80 that means 120 mmHg above Atmospheric; 80 mmHg above Atmospheric. If it decreased its radius, the rate of blood flow would go down even though the pressure drop stays the same. You’d stop digestion for some period or slow it down; provide less blood flow for that purpose. Does that make sense?Well if we look at how pressure varies through the circulatory system, your blood pressure is generated by the heart. Blood pressure ranges between 120/80 mmHg. We’ll talk about that more in a few minutes and we’ll talk about that in great detail on Thursday. How come they need a big pressure drop, which is what’s illustrated here. Well, there’s a huge advantage because wherever the pressure drop occurs, that’s the place where you have the best opportunity to adjust the flow because small changes in radius are going to lead to large changes in relative resistance. You could do something like this, let’s say this is a very imaginary situation, but I drew it just for illustrative purposes. It looks just like a circuit diagram because the equations are the same. Well, because if any one of the vessels in here increases its resistance it increases the overall resistance of the aggregate of vessels. Where this arrow is here is the aorta, this is the aortic arch, and then goes down to the abdomen and up to the brain."
81,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-14,"Professor Saltzman describes the blood flow through the systemic and pulmonary circulatory system. More specifically, he describes, with the help of diagrams, the events that lead to blood flow in the body as a function of contraction/relaxation by specific chambers of the heart, and the effect of four valves which help direct flow. Important terms and concepts such as systole/diastole pressures, cardiac output (CO) as a function of heart rate (HR) and ejection volume (EV), and the action potential propagation that stimulates heart muscle contraction are discussed.","So, we’re going to continue the discussion of cardiovascular physiology today. Same thing happens in a liquid; only in a liquid the change is not so dramatic as in an ideal gas. Well, imagine that you had a simpler system than your heart. In order to get blood flowing in one direction you push the blood out, you close a gate, and then when you’re re-inflating the heart the blood can’t come back. Because pressure is going up and down in the heart, that oscillation in pressure with heartbeat gets transmitted into the aorta as well and we’ll talk in a minute about why that happens. If you think about the whole circuit, this blood has to flow from the aorta, through the systemic circulation and back into the right atrium. Pressure drops throughout the circulatory system. When the pressure goes up inside the mitral valve closes. The ejection volume or the volume of blood that’s ejected from the ventricle on each beat times the heart rate is equal to the cardiac output (EV * HR = CO). The total pressure, and the pressure is high so this must be the left ventricle because it’s reaching about 90 mmHg, the pressure you need to drive the systemic circulation. This is the trace for the atrium on the bottom here. If I looked at the pressure drop at this point ΔP it’s higher in the atrium than it is in the ventricle and blood is naturally flowing that way. The atrium contracts, pressure stays higher in atrium than it is in the ventricle. Because the aortic valve is closed; during diastole the aortic valve is closed. Both valves are closed and the ventricle is contracting. Eventually that pressure is going to rise enough that the pressure in the ventricle crosses over the pressure in the aorta. Their heart is operating very efficiently; ejecting more volume per beat and so they need less beats to supply the cardiac output. A conditioned athlete will be able to do both of those very efficiently. Those sounds often have to do with valves that are not functioning properly. That’s what physicians are listening for when they listen to your chest during a physical exam. As it passes in that orderly way the muscles are activated to contract in an orderly way as well, I’d like you to review for next time what we talked about in terms of action potentials that are in Chapter 6 because we’re going to talk about those in the context of a heart for next time."
82,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-15,"Professor Saltzman talks about electrical conductivity in the heart: that is, the generation and propagation of electrical potential in heart cells. He describes the role of ion channels and pumps in transporting sodium, potassium, and calcium ions to create action potential. This propagation of signal from the sinoatrial node through different tissues, which can be replaced by a pacemaker, eventually stimulates contraction of muscle fibers throughout the heart. Next, he describes the electrocardiograph and how each wave trace corresponds to the events caused by depolarization/repolarization of different heart tissues.","So, today we’re going to continue to talk about cardiac physiology. We’ll talk about today sort of the origins of electrical activity in the heart, the role that this electrical activity plays in the function of the heart, and then finally how–we’ll talk a little bit about how one can measure that electrical activity which comes from cells in the heart, sort of deep inside your body, but can be measured with electrodes on the surface of your body. Some are active transport proteins like this one which is called the sodium-potassium pump. It’s because they have these little machines in their membranes that are continually pumping sodium out and potassium in. The pump always has to be operating because the leak is always happening. Every cell in your body at a given time is going to have lots of potassium channels that are open and lots of sodium channels that are open. Just like a battery, because these currents are flowing, if I measure the electrical potential on both sides of this membrane I would get a voltage difference. To make it more complicated there are certain of these ion channels that exist in open and closed states. A small change in membrane potential, but you feel it. Now, what happens when all these new sodium channels open? If you don’t understand all the details of that, that’s fine, it’s described in the book and also described in other membrane physiology books that you could go to. Well, it does that through a specialized group of pathways that are collectively called the cardiac conduction system. It had more words than I liked so I blocked some of them out. The SA node, if you look at it, here’s the action potential in the SA node, depolarization, repolarization, now look what happens here. Cells like cells of the SA node that are capable of doing this have special properties of their ion channels. Start to put the picture together now, SA node action potential, wave of action potential of the atria, contraction of the atria, AV node gets the signal, waits, generates an action potential and that action potential quickly propagates down through the bundle of His in the Purkinje system. So, the AV node provides that separation in time of the atrial contractions and the ventricle contractions. Then the AV node will take over because it’s no longer being stimulated by the SA nodes action potential and the wave that results, it will start beating but the heart will beat slower, it will beat at 40 beats per minute let’s say. The reason that calcium is a much more important player is, as you will learn if you study more physiology, calcium is the most important ion in terms of initiating contraction. This just shows an action potential in, for example, a ventricular cell. You’d also expect that your cardiac performance would not be so good, because you don’t have this delay then the ventricle is contracting before it’s fully filled by the atrial contractions. One of the things that cardiologists have learned how to do is how to look at potentials that are generated from different spatial locations, and correlate that with things that are happening over the complex geography of the heart."
83,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-16,"Professor Saltzman introduces the basic concepts of renal physiology. Professor Saltzman first introduces the function and anatomy of the kidney. Special attention is given to the cell types and structural aspect of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney. Filtration, secretion of toxic waste, and reabsorption of water, ions, and nutrients through the glomerulus and various segments of the nephrons is discussed in detail. Finally, Professor Saltzman describes glomerular filtration rate as a function of pressure drop, which is regulated by afferent and efferent arterioles, to control how much volume being filtered through glomerulus.","This week we’re going to talk about renal physiology. We’ll talk about that on Thursday afternoon. I’ll talk a little bit about the differences between plasma; plasma is the fluid that circulates in your body. It has an amazingly sophisticated organization which is critical for its function. We talked about how that works and why that’s so important. If your sodium and potassium levels are not correct you can’t make an action potential in the way that we’ve described before; heart doesn’t beat, brains can’t send signals. That would be–that’s difficult to do and you know we don’t do that. Well, that’s really the main function of the kidney. All of these things are linked together in some way. In order to perform this function of regulating concentrations of things in the blood, it needs to see a lot of blood. In particular, the waste product of nitrogen, and all amino acids have nitrogen. Now, the flow through the abdominal aorta is quite high. If blood goes in, blood has to come back out. Less potassium per day because there’s less potassium–concentration of sodium is high, potassium is low in the extracellular fluid; a lot of bicarbonate, the main pH buffer in the blood, and quite a lot of urea, 500 grams of urea. What comes out we could think about analyzing by looking at what comes out in the urine. Now, that would make sense for the kidney because what’s in the blood that you don’t want to pass through? The flip side of that is for you not to shrink you’ve got to be consuming that amount of water. In particular, it has to recover things that you need. Filtration is not selective enough because there are lots of molecules that are about the same size, some that are toxic, and some that are essential for health, and you can’t separate them just based on size. Well, filtration is an important part of it, so filtration occurs in the kidney, it’s the initial separation that happens where molecules that your kidney is processing gets separated from the blood plasma. You cannot live a healthy life very long without all of these things happening continuously. Nephrons are just a series of tubes that are arranged in a very specific configuration. The glomerulus is where these two sets of tubules meet. Now, this is a different kind of a pressure drop because we’ve been thinking about a pressure drop along a tube, high pressure here, low pressure here, and so fluid flows through the tube. Proximal convoluted tubule, the fluid flows through; it flows down this loop and this loop extends from the top near the cortex of the kidney down toward the medulla and then up again. Somebody–Brian did you– Capillaries have a sizeable resistance but not the most and it is important because it’s the place where–remember size is regulated so that you can adjust flow rates most sensitively here; in the arterioles or the small arteries."
84,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-17,"Professor Saltzman continues his description of nephron anatomy, and the specific role of each part of the nephron in establishing concentration gradients to help in secretion and reabsorption of water, ions, nutrients and wastes. A number of molecular transport processes that produces urine from the initial ultra-filtrate, such as passive diffusion by concentration difference, osmosis, and active transport with sodium-potassium ATPase, are listed. Next, Professor Saltzman describes a method to measure glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using tracer molecule, inulin. He then talks about regulation of sodium, an important ion for cell signaling in the body, as an example to demonstrate the different ways in which nephrons maintain homeostasis.","So, I’m going to continue talking about renal physiology today; again, this is covered in Chapter 9. This is a picture that I showed you before, sort of to orient you again; I have this picture of a kidney lying on its side. In particular, the cells of these tubules are able to reabsorb the molecules that you need. The green arrow, which just appeared up here, is supposed to indicate for this glomerulus right there filtration happens. Now, we’re not going to talk about it at all in this class, but if you go on to study physiology, one of the most amazing things about the nephron is its–is that this loop allows the nephron to create a gradient of osmolarity within the tissue outside the nephrons in the kidney. Then, whatever is not reabsorbed, plus what’s secreted, is what ends up in the urine after it flows through all the tubules. The question is how would you measure this glomerular filtration rate in people? If you get inulin in your blood, it just circulates and isn’t changed at all, but it’s small enough that it’s filtered in the glomerulus. If there’s inulin in the blood then it gets filtered through the glomerulus and ends up in the ultra-filtrate. Now, since inulin is neither reabsorbed nor secreted, however many molecules of inulin are filtered at the glomerulus has to be the same as the number of molecules that enter the urine. Remember that one of the features of this ultra-filtrate is that it just cuts off in molecular weight but whatever concentration–if you’re below that molecular weight, whatever concentration is in the plasma is the same as the initial concentration in the ultra-filtrate, and so the plasma inulin concentration is the same here. Reabsorption of water, I tried to emphasize last time how important reabsorption of water is, because you have to produce a lot of filtrate in order to collect a lot of waste products. Secretion happens mainly in the distal convoluted tubule, and as I mentioned, we’re not going to say very much about that. Now, I mention this special property in inulin, that it’s neither reabsorbed or secreted, and that’s shown here by this flat line, so whatever gets filtered in the glomerulus, at the glomerulus, that number of molecules remains in the urine throughout its progress through the tubules. Sodium, on the other hand, has a much more complicated pattern. Now, some of these things are going to be hard for you to understand why they go in and out. The intracellular concentration of sodium is low. High concentration here, low concentration here, so if this membrane is permeable to sodium it’s going to diffuse from inside to outside. I don’t want to say too much about this diagram. That’s why it’s easy to lose a pound or two, you can do that by just restricting salt in your diet."
85,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-18,"Professor Saltzman introduces the material properties of elasticity and viscosity. He describes two separate experimental setups to measure the elasticity and the viscosity of a material. Material elasticity can be defined in terms of stress-strain property, and defines the Young’s modulus (E), which is the slope of the stress-strain curve. Fluid viscosity, on the other hand, is described by shear stress. When modeling any material, the spring can be used to represent an ideal elastic material and the dashpot an ideal viscoelastic material. All biomaterials contain some combination of these properties and can be described by physical models that consist of both spring and dashpot.","So, this week we’re going to talk about biomechanics and the reading is Chapter 10. Some of you, I have no doubt, are going to go onto study biomechanics in greater detail. Let’s just think about rubber for the beginning, maybe even a rubber band. The way that I would measure that is by just applying different forces. In fact, up to a certain amount of force, if I measured the strain that results from forces, I would get a straight line. Because once you knew the slope of this line, you could draw the curve that represents all of its stress strain behavior. We’re just describing it in a different way now. It still might be elastic but it’s not linearly elastic so you can’t describe it by just the slope anymore. You could define the stress at failure, when the material physically breaks, or the strain at failure when it physically doesn’t function as a material anymore; for the rubber band you add so much force that it breaks. So, it doesn’t even behave in the way that stress continuously goes up with strain anymore, and that’s because of the way we’ve defined it. You could classify materials that are elastic into different properties. The second thing I want to think about is viscosity. Does this make sense?So, now you could imagine if you could that, if I had a layer of fluid here and another desktop sitting on top, I could apply a force this way parallel to the surface and the thing would move easily. What you’re really doing in that experiment I just described is the same thing as the experiment we did when we hung the rubber band from the top of the ceiling here, is that I’ve applied a force and I’ve measured a deformation. If this is a perfect elastic material like a rubber band or like the springs you learned about in physics, when I apply a force here, it instantaneously changes its length. Deformations are instantaneous; they take no time at all for a perfect elastic material. It’s what we call a viscoelastic material, and most biological materials have that property. They have some elasticity, they deform elastically under stress. All the force gets applied instantaneously and then after that I just maintain the force and I hold the material there. I understand the spring and if it was a perfect–if the muscle was a perfect elastic material I could describe all of its behavior by its spring constant or its elastic modulus. Well, I gave you this example of the plate sliding over the layer of fluid. A real dashpot, if it’s going to deform for a long time, would have to be infinitely long as well, so it’s better as a thought experiment than a real thing to build but you get the thought experiment, right?I have a spring here, how will it behave when I force on it? This is an example of one kind of viscoelastic behavior. It would not have any initial deformation."
86,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-19,"Professor Saltzman begins the lecture with discussion of the importance of motion for the survival and propagation of any living species. He presents the different modes of motion, taking first the example flight to talk about force balance, such as the magnitude of propulsive force that must be generated overcome drag to produce forward motion. Next, the mechanics of walking, running, cycling and swimming is discussed, with emphasis on efficient use of energy, overcoming drag and friction, and the influence of organism shape and size. An equation to calculate drag force of a spherical object of radius, , moving at velocity, , in a medium with viscosity, , is introduced: . Finally, Professor Saltzman talks about design of the artificial hip, which biomedical engineers must take into consideration the biomechanics and natural function of the pelvic bone.","So, today we’re going to continue talking about the subject of biomechanics. The shape or the profile of the object that’s in this field also matters, keep that in mind as well. Maybe you’ve ridden on a plane that has a propeller on it, maybe not, but it’s a little bit easier to describe this way; that the forward force that overcomes drag is provided by a propeller that spins and creates a force in the forward direction. A typical, sort of airfoil or wing design is shown here. What happens is it’s using this flow of air, this constant flow of air over the body, over the wings for example, by changing the shape so that there’s more surface area on top of the wing than there is on the bottom. Then, varying between those two things you can both move forward and supply the lift you need to overcome the force of gravity. Some birds are smaller than others, some are bigger, some have different shaped wings, different shaped bodies. When I was talking about the airplane example or even the bird example, I was talking about using the forward motion supplied by thrust in order to create the pressure drop that brings you up. They have the muscles that allow them to make this kind of a motion, and they’re fairly small so they don’t need much lift force in order to keep them aloft to overcome the problem of gravity. Now, how would you define efficiency here? That helps you solve the problem of balance. You don’t want to hit the ground because of friction, that would be a waste of energy, you want to lift it just enough so that you clear the ground and you do that by tilting your pelvis up and by bending your knee a little and manipulating your foot. Potential energy; so one of the other things that happens, if you notice somebody walking, and it’s hard to notice if you just see me walking like this, maybe you can, but my head is actually moving up and down when I walk because my center of gravity is rising and falling as I pick my leg off the ground and let it swing. Did you walk by yourself or did you walk in–anybody walk in a pair? Why do some people walk more quickly than others? Their legs are longer so their bodies are shaped differently. Metronomes are pendulums like that, too, that have an adjustable weight. Depending on the length and weight of your leg, as a pendulum, it has a natural frequency at which it wants to swing. If I want to walk slower than my natural state, I have to slow something down. You can feel that transition if you try to walk fast. Particularly if you knew you had to move that fast you’d pick a bicycle. You’re moving your legs but your center of gravity stays relatively uniform, very little up and down. Well, it’s friction or drag, it’s the same problem really that all movement has to overcome, but we’re not thinking so much about friction on the Earth now we’re thinking more about the drag force that’s created from moving through a fluid. Air has a relatively low viscosity, water has a higher viscosity, molasses or honey has an even higher viscosity, but it’s harder to move through water than it is through air because it’s thicker, it’s harder to slip the plains of packets of water passed each other to go back to the description I gave you of viscosity last time. It turns out that there’s a very simple relationship between the drag force and the velocity that you move forward for objects that are spherical or roughly spherical. Let’s just use that as an estimate and it’s moving through the same viscosity. So, degenerating hips can cause tremendous amounts of pain for people. You don’t want something that bends a lot there."
87,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-1,"Professor Saltzman introduces the concepts and applications of biomedical engineering, providing an overview of the course syllabus, reading materials for lecture and labs and grading logistics. Various pictures are shown to highlight the current application of biomedical engineering technologies in daily life (eg. chest x-ray, PET scan, operating room, gene chip, transport). Next, living standards and medical technologies of the past and present are compared to point out the impact of biomedical engineering as well as areas for improvement in the field. Finally, Professor Saltzman draws references from the poem “London Bridge” to illustrate some societal issues in making materials and devices in biomedical engineering.","This is a course, a version of which I’ve taught almost every year for the last twenty years and it evolves a little bit every year. This is one example of that: this is actually artificial skin. And if you maintained it in the right way, this polymer scaffold together with the skin cells will grow into skin. It’s an example of a technology called a gene chip that allows you to, on each one of these spots there is DNA for example, that’s specific for a particular gene in your genome, in the human genome for example. So this has been a remarkable innovation. Well you could stretch it and say that an example of engineering to improve human health is getting them from one place to another, but that would be more of a stretch than I’m going to make. Engineers who are developing new materials, materials that can be, if you think about it, there’s not very many things that you would want to put in your eye and that you would feel comfortable putting into your eye, so this is a very safe, a very inert material. You can imagine that there are many requirements that a device like this has to meet in order for it to be a good artificial hip and we’ll talk about those and how the design of these has changed over the years and what we can expect in the future. And then we’ll talk about how you can build something to replace a complicated small part in the body like that. Engineering became a discipline in about the middle of the 1800s. In 1665, 93% of the people that died in that year died of infectious diseases. How do you engineer what happens in our immune system in order to protect us from diseases? It was easy to tell if somebody had an infectious disease but you might not have known that they had cancer at that time and they just died. Cardiovascular disease, why is cardiovascular disease on the top?Obesity or generally our diets are different than they were in 1665. In other places, infectious disease is a much bigger part of their life and a much greater risk of death from infectious diseases and parasitic diseases if you live in places other than the U.S. or Western Europe, for example. Now, I’ve highlighted three of these in blue here, imaging, mechanics, and biomolecular engineering because if you go on to study Biomedical Engineering here at Yale anyway, these are the things that you might pick to emphasize on. So I’m going to post those online and we’re not going to talk about them directly in the lectures but they’re there as a resource, so if you read about something like pH and you’ve forgotten what pH is, you can go back to Chapter 2 which is posted and you can read about pH and I try to take you through sort of what you need to know in order to understand the rest of the course material. This is a picture of London Bridge, it’s an interesting bridge which is important in the history of London. When they reconstructed London Bridge they moved the old London Bridge to Arizona; some guy bought it."
88,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-20,"Professor Saltzman first reviews the electromagnetic spectrum, the different regimes of the spectrum, their respective wavelengths, energies, and ways of detecting them. He then talks about the use of high energy radio waves for imaging of the body. The history, components, advantages and limitations of X-ray imaging are presented in detail. Next, he introduces Computed Tomography, a related imaging technique which uses mathematical computation to compile line-scanned X-rays into a three dimensional image. Finally, Professor Saltzman touches on harmful effects of X-ray radiation, and ways to limit or avoid overexposure in these imaging techniques.","Well, this week we’re going to talk about biomedical imaging. So, you see the outlines of the objects, and their colors, and their textures, but it’s basically a representation of how visible light is interacting with some object. By taking a picture of how these particular forms of electromagnetic radiation called X-rays, by taking a picture of how it penetrates through the body, you can get an image that represents something about what’s inside. This is a representation of the variation in properties of electromagnetic radiation. If you take a picture of a neighborhood at night using an infrared camera you can see how much heat is being emitted from all the different houses. The frequency is related to how much energy these waves contain. When they hit your body they can produce changes, in particular, produce atoms–or ions from atoms. Well, you could but not really very well on living people. We knew something about that but we weren’t able to look inside a living body. In this case you’d see a shadow of this object. The shadow would be light where there was density in the object and it would be dark where there was hollowness or less density in the object. In this way, an X-ray is a shadow, it’s an inverse image of the density through which the X-ray passed. If you didn’t confine those X-rays in some ways they would be emitted in all directions. You confine it so that X-rays are only emitted from one side. The object is the patient, so I’m standing here, and there’s something behind me that’s going to detect the X-rays that pass through. Now, there are detectors that are electronic and so you can detect things electronically without film. What’s it going to pass through in the body if you do a chest X-ray of my chest, for example, where will the X-rays pass through the most easily? So, what you see is dark here, the less dense regions are the lungs where nothing much interfered with the X-rays passing through the body. Another problem with X-rays is radiation dose. These are all ways that radiologists use to reduce the radiation dose to patients. You can basically see my body from every angle."
89,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-21,"Professor Saltzman continues his discussion of biomedical imaging technology. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is introduced as an alternate form of imaging, which does not use ionizing radiation yet can provide detailed structure of the body. Functional MRI (fMRI) has a different application from traditional MRI. It can be used to measure oxygen consumption (tissue metabolic rate), and is an important tool in deciphering brain function. Third, ultrasound imaging is another imaging technique that can detect motion by translating sound wave reflections into structural images at fast timescale. Finally, examples of nuclear imaging and advances in light microscopy are discussed.","So, today we’re going to continue talking about imaging. In a CT image, what forms the contrast is the absorbance of X-rays by the tissue. The properties that you can measure by this process called nuclear magnetic resonance depend not only on the atom that you’re stimulating, hydrogen in this case, but the microenvironment or local surrounding that the atom finds itself in. To perform magnetic resonance and to make magnetic resonance images you need a very strong magnetic field. So when you enter an MR suite, you have to make sure that you’re not carrying anything metal, wearing anything metal, or carrying anything magnetized that has a risk of being demagnetized with it because these are very strong magnetic fields. It’s close-fitting, you don’t want the size of the cylinder to be too far away from the patient because you want the magnetic field forces and the radio waves that are emitted by the ions in your–by the atoms in your body to be very close to the detectors that are measuring it. Surrounding this cylinder are coils and coils, many miles of coils of wire, and electrical field. One of the advantages of MR, and we’ll see a little bit more about this as we go through the physics, is that it can be tuned. They’re out of alignment, the nuclei are rotating. These are generally presumed to be safe for biological tissues. In this image you don’t see that so clearly but you see better the distinction between brain tissue and the cerebral spinal fluid that’s in the ventricles. It uses the same approach, but instead of designing your radio frequency pulses so that you look at the static structure, you design it so that you’re particularly sensitive for looking at flowing blood. An experiment that–well, the other thing about fMRI before I talk about the experiment, is that instead of just looking at anatomy now, this is a high resolution picture of the anatomy of the brain, an fMRI image is fuzzier. You have to look over time in order to measure that. You’re not using light or different forms of light; you’re using sound to create images instead. Sounds is pressure waves that transmit through a medium. Ultrasound creates echo time maps and calculates depths from that. There are random sources of interference with the ultrasound image. If this was a video image you would see the valves opening and closing in correct coordination hopefully with the contraction of the heart. This is an example of an ultrasound image, it looks the same way, an ultrasound image of an infant. The image quality is not as high, but you can image things that are in motion. I want to talk briefly about nuclear medicine. So, I can make very nice maps of the brain like these that show you where the positron emitting isotope accumulates in the brain. In general you need a cyclotron or some kind of a machine to generate these radio isotopes as well. That’s a problem because light doesn’t penetrate through your body, it bounces off; most of it bounces off. They allow you to use light radiation in order to look at magnified images of biological objects. I could take a light beam and shine it here into a fiber."
90,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-22,"Professor Saltzman motivates the need for tissue engineering, and describes the basic elements of the tissue engineering approach. Professor Saltzman defines three different types of tissue transplants: autografts, allografts, and xenografts. An online resource for organ donors/recipients is presented, which stresses the great need for donors, and the important contribution of tissue engineering in producing/growing organs that can be used for this purpose. Next, Professor Saltzman compared drug and gene therapy, and discusses the use of stem cell in tissue engineering for wound healing. The need for compatible biomaterials to support growth and differentiation of stem cells into functional organ is also highlighted.","So, this week we’re going to be talking about the subject of tissue engineering. For example, you know that burns of the skin are quite common. If you lose enough of your skin, you lose a lot of water through that open area of skin. Not as many as in the case of skin, but a significant number. They have to match not only biologically, but it all has to match in terms of timing as well, and that’s a complicated process. If the donor of the organ died in California and the recipient is here in New Haven, then you’ve got to get the organ as quickly as possible from California to Connecticut. If the liver starts to die you’re not making as many of these, you can have a bleeding disorder. You could imagine treating any one of these with drugs. These are areas where drug therapy works. That first paper I gave you to read by Langer & Vacanti is really considered one of the first, most influential scientific papers in this growing field. In particular, the biology of cells in culture of taking cells out of organs and tissues, maintaining them in culture, getting them to do the things we wanted to do in culture was fairly well known by the 1980s, it’s a fairly mature technology. The best substitute for this is a natural one. If we could grow natural arterial and endothelial cells all over the surface of this, the blood wouldn’t know that it’s a synthetic material. They have a mild cardial infarction or a heart attack because the blood becomes comprised to some area. This damaged cardiac muscle doesn’t do that anymore. Now, where would the cells come from that you did that with if we think about this particular application, we’re going to create a patch for repairing myocardial defects. What would be your first choice of cells that you use for this? I list on this slide a few of the characteristics of tissue engineering that we’re going to talk about, not in quite this organized a way, but I hope that by the end of the week you’ll be able to look back at this list and say, ‘Oh, I understand what that characteristic means in terms of what we’re trying to accomplish in tissue engineering.’ Because now you not only have the cells of the heart but you have the cells of the heart arranged in the right kind of configuration, so I could understand–I could use it to understand how the heart develops. They have clotted so that a clot has formed inside these vessels so that the bleeding stops. It looks different from your skin, that’s the beginning of the healing process, is that your body has coagulated blood at that site to replace the tissue that’s been lost. Well, one is that you could put a material in here and the material goes into the wound. Maybe you don’t need material at all, but maybe you could replace this with cells. Maybe they’re stem cells that came from somewhere, or maybe they’re just cells. I’ve shown this, I’ve given you examples of this that–where I motivated it with thinking about the skin, but this doesn’t have to be the skin. Maybe not 100%, but if they do it quickly and they do it well that these cells will regrow the connections that are lost in this section of trauma. So, the obvious place to go for that is to use the kinds of materials that the body uses for repairing tissues."
91,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-23,"In this lecture, Professor Saltzman continues his discussion of tissue engineering, and its role in facilitating healing, tissue regeneration, organ replacement, drug delivery and as model for studying human physiology. Specific examples from current research by scientists at Yale are used to illustrate some of these points and to highlight the current progress in the field. Some examples are generating neo-tissues from hydrogel scaffold seeded with cells, healing spinal cords and controlling mechanical properties of newly grown blood vessels with external conditions.","So, we’re going to continue talking about tissue engineering today. We talked about it at the beginning of class last time, there’s a logical extension of conventional medical and surgical practices. There are human diseases where that regenerative capacity is overwhelmed. Infection can be that kind of a disease, hepatitis infection, for example; cirrhosis is that kind of infection. If you keep that tissue, you can isolate the cells that form the lining of that tissue. Imagine that instead of putting food coloring in it like we did, you put in a protein. One way you might use it to treat disease is to implant these things into areas of the body that–where there aren’t enough blood vessels. What you see particularly in high magnification is that lots and lots of new blood vessels form and they connect back to the major vessels that are already in the legs. What if you put cells from the pancreas in there? This is one of the central ideas of tissue engineering. It looks like a network of fibers that are all wound together. Instead of making a triangle or a square, or a cross, they made a polymer scaffold that looks a little bit like a human ear and they filled this scaffold–this is 100% polymer now, there’s no tissue in here, but then they added cartilage cells. Here’s what looks like a human ear growing on the ear of a rabbit. It’s got to be strong enough to put a stitch into because you’ve got to sew this into the natural artery. While they were developing and turning from just collections of cells into arterial tissue, they were exposed to flowing blood because the embryonic heart was already beating, there’s already an immature circulatory system. Here’s a picture of a bioreactor, here is an artificial blood vessel that she made in the laboratory. They’ve done this for many, many months now, even years in some cases. You can form vessels that are smaller than any that have been transplanted in this way and they maintain their function in culture. In the pancreas, one of the most important metabolic functions is that it senses glucose and secretes insulin in response to glucose. What you would like, then, is for these cells to be able to communicate with the body through molecules but not directly. There are a variety of other ways of doing this as well. It has to allow insulin to pass but not antibodies. You could take Dr. Niklason’s tissue engineered blood vessels and use them to understand more about how blood vessels develop during embryonic development, because she’s created a system where she can control many of the key variable. You could add cells at different time and see how this developing tissue responds to that."
92,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-24,"Professor Saltzman uses cancer diagnosis and treatment as an example to demonstrate the some applications of biomedical engineering technologies and methods. Some issues involved in cancer treatment, such as tumor angiogenesis, radiation sensitivity, drug localization, and cancer stem cells are mentioned. Next, he describes the phases (I-IV), in compliance to guidelines enforced by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which a new drug compound must go through to gain approval prior to public distribution/sale. Finally, Professor Saltzman draws attention to the areas that biomedical engineers may contribute to, to improve this process.","So, what I’m going to talk about today and Thursday is two topics, which what I hope to do is sort of bring together some of the information that we’ve been talking about over the course of the term. Just a few facts about cancer that you probably know something about this, it’s now the most common cause of death in the U.S. and that’s true in many developed countries. So, half of men will have some kind of cancer, and 1 in 3 for women. This just illustrates that last point a little more clearly. Cancer cells can grow much faster than that so they have mechanisms for dividing very rapidly. They don’t differentiate normally but tend to remain as immature de-differentiated or undifferentiated cells. They don’t grow beyond that as a cell mass because they can’t get nutrients, oxygen, glucose, the things that the cell needs, amino acids. When the cell is just dividing out of control there’s no blood supply. Many people think that tumor size would be limited. An additional stage after angiogenesis that some tumors can go through is a process called metastasis. This is an example of biomedical engineering for diagnosis. You can see the cells are flat, they have small nuclei, not a lot of protein and so the cells don’t stain very darkly. If you have an abnormal growth on your skin, the surgeon might cut off some of that tissue and send it to a laboratory for analysis and to find out if it’s cancer or not. Radiation is focused on a Petri dish that contains cells and then you expose them to some amount of radiation. That you want to kill cells of the tumor but you don’t want to kill cells that are also sensitive to radiation in other parts of the body? You do that by just focusing the radiation on the site that you want. You do it by localizing where the radiation is delivered. This is described a little bit more in the chapter in your book. Cells that lack DNA repair mechanisms, if you expose them to ionizing radiation; they’re much more sensitive because they don’t have the mechanisms to repair sub-lethal damage. One concept that has emerged over the last 10 years or so is to deliver chemotherapy drugs locally instead of delivering them over the whole body. Usually from the time that you think about a drug, I have a drug, say drug X and I think it might inhibit this signaling pathway in colon cancer. You begin to refine your approach such that you’re starting to test not only for the activity in animals because you find that, ‘Yes, your drug X does–is an effective treatment for cancer.’ They look at all the data you’ve collected over the last four years and they say, ‘Yes you’ve convinced us that this looks like a good drug, it looks like it’ll be safe, you can go ahead and start testing it in people. You do that in a small number of patients first just because this is the first time it’s been used to test effectiveness in people and you’re not quite sure what’s going to happen. In cancer trials, they tend to be hundreds or thousands in size. The study doesn’t end there, in that all manufacturers of drugs are required to keep track of what happens as their drug is introduced into the population. You will have noticed, in the newspaper over the past few years, some very famous drugs that turned out to have side effects that weren’t expected after they were released into the general population. They published a poster which is available online that talks about sort of modern developments in cancer diagnosis and treatment."
93,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-25,"In this final lecture, Professor Saltzman talks about artificial organs, with a stress on synthetic biomaterials. First, the body’s responses (immunological and scar healing responses) to foreign materials are introduced. This leads to discussion of different types of polymer/plastic materials (i.e., Dacron and GORE-TEX) and their properties. Next, Professor Saltzman talks about the design and function of some artificial organs, such as lens implants, heart valves and vessels, hip, dialyzer, heart/lung bypass machine, and the artificial heart. Lastly, challenges and areas for improvement in the field are presented.","So, today I’m going to continue to talk about applications of Biomedical Engineering, so as sort of a way to bring together some of the concepts that we’ve talked about over the last several months. The other slide, here, I wanted to show you what I think is a remarkable material. It’s like a contact lens but it’s permanently placed inside the eye over your natural lens. You can make materials that are made up of polymers that have very long chains or shorter chains. One of the applications I’ve already talked about last week was making tubes of polymers, tubes of polymers that can be used to replace the conduits through which blood flow. As the size goes down, it becomes more difficult to use synthetic materials in these applications. That same property makes it useful for arterial grafts as well. There are diseases of valves that are not uncommon. In this kind of a ball valve, the ball is still in the way. In addition, you can imagine this ball slamming up and then slamming back down. In many ways it’s similar, it has the same kind of a textile ring and metal on the outside. Prosthesis just means replacement, so this is derived from natural tissue is an alternative to this mechanical valve. Physicians will use one of these types of valves or another depending on which of your valves needs replacement, what their own experience is with people that have diseases like the ones they’re treating. One of the problems with every synthetic material that’s used to replace a component of your circulatory system, like a heart valve, is that you form a thin layer of clot on the surface. Now, what you hope is that that happens within the first few hours of when the heart valve is replaced. So, a bad heart valve might give you a stroke in the brain. These other two pictures show you other kinds of reactions. The material here was a mesh and you can see where the fibers of the mesh are, where there’s clear dots here. Every material produces a different reaction when you put it into the body. Within the next few days cells will start to accumulate around the material. Eventually, the splinter gets covered with some kind of a tissue and it comes up towards the top of your skin and eventually gets ejected from your body. Some of the responses are very mild in that you get very little protein absorbed, you get very few cells recruited to the site. Design has gotten better over time with these, and I’ll talk about some of the ways that it’s gotten better. As your bone heals around this implant what if bone could grow though the material, then you’d have bone on both sides sort of locking it in. One of the problems with older designs of these materials, particularly when they use Teflon and not polyethylene, is that over time as you used your hip while, there wasn’t much friction between the metal ball and the poly–or the Teflon cup, there was enough friction where the Teflon would start to wear. Eventually, as in this case with this particular patient, could totally disappear. There are newer kinds of materials that people are beginning to create. Now, blood is flowing through this hollow fiber just like before. Then, if blood came in and it had sugar in it, that sugar would diffuse out into the fluid in the shell, what we used to call dialysate. A device that is similar to that, the same kind of idea, is used to treat patients that have severe liver disease. What has been a goal of biomedical engineers, for many decades, is to design an artificial heart that could be totally implanted and could replace the function of your heart when your heart begins to fail."
94,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-2,"Class begins with discussion of students’ answers to the two questions given as assignment in the previous lecture. Professor Saltzman talks about the basic concept of biomedical engineering and two separate aspects of it: gaining better understanding of human physiology and developing ways to improve human health. He then introduces the term, and talks about parameters that are involved in controlling this state. Finally, the structure of the phospholipid is discussed and how it constitutes the cell membrane.","What I’m going to talk about today is to continue our discussion about what is Biomedical Engineering and go a little bit further and we’ll spend about half the class doing that, and then I want to spend the last half of the class talking about some biological structures that are very important and that you might not be familiar with. Must be a couple of others - yeah– contact lenses. Right and I think all of those are good, so there’s lots of different ways. So controlling the dose is really important and that’s going to turn out to be very important in cancer therapy because these are very potent drugs that will have bad effects in other sites and you want to localize them where they want, so we’re going to talk about that. Or what - and often it’s not going to be just one gene, it’s going to be combinations of genes, and how do you predict the fate of the individual based on all of the genes that you know to be involved in progression of a certain disease. If you could image how the heart is moving, you would know a lot about its function. Now another approach would be to take pieces of the pancreas that already have all that capability within them. Because nutrition is going to be one of the big problems of your generation; how to have enough nutritious food for the population as it grows. As these tools became applied more and more widely, we learned more about how human physiology worked. So this is another kind of engineering, an engineering not to look more closely at how humans work but an engineering to improve their function when it’s failing. This is an example of a rudimentary brain machine interface. Now these are electrodes that are only sending out signals. Weight is remarkably well controlled if you let your body do its business. Also, temperature, you could measure your temperature and you’d find variations throughout the day or maybe some throughout the year, but within a remarkably narrow range your temperature is controlled. These are mechanisms that can be described not too differently from mechanisms that you’re familiar with for maintaining homeostasis. For example, the thermostat in your dorm room. So we’re going to think about - in the next few weeks - we’re going to think about the human organism at different levels of magnification and I’ve shown those levels here. We’ll talk about how they work and we’ll go over that quickly because I know most of you know something about how DNA - what DNA is and how it works."
95,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-3,"Professor Saltzman introduces the elements of molecular structure of DNA such as backbone, base composition, base pairing, and directionality of nucleic acids. He describes the processes of DNA synthesis, transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational processing required to make a protein such as insulin from its genetic code (DNA). Professor Saltzman describes the genetic code. RNA interference is also discussed as a way to control gene expression, which can be applied as a new way to treat diseases.","This week we’re going to talk about DNA technology and genetic engineering: this is Chapter 3 of the book. The nucleotide has a directionality, there’s an up and a down to it and it’s going to turn out the chain that’s formed by polymerizing these has a directionality as well and that’s important in defining the structure. There are two of them that are going to be important to us, one is adenine and the other is guanine, shown here. The second class is the pyrimidines and there’s three of those that are important; uracil, thymine and cytosine which we’re going too simplify by calling (U), (T) and (C).Now remember that there were only four different colors in the cartoon of the DNA double helix that we talked about and I told you that those colors are really - represent the bases but there’s five of them here. You can just say it’s RNA or DNA and you know everything about the pentose in every molecule on the chain. You can say a polymer of DNA, for example, is four bases long, that means it has four of these repeat units and they go in the sequence from 5’ to 3’ of (A)(G)(T)(G). They are linked together by four different colored segments indicated here not by colors now but by letters. The corresponding half of the ladder that corresponds to any given ladder, let’s say the black DNA molecule that corresponds to the blue one is not just a mirror image. I told you that the fidelity is very high. If I took two double stranded DNA molecules and I exposed them to certain conditions that caused them to denature, that means its native structure falls apart. That tells you something about the physical chemistry of the molecule; that it’s these hydrogen bonds that hold the double strands and I can break those down under certain conditions. But they will do that in a very particular way, in that only strands that exactly match will be able to reform their native structure. That RNA is made into proteins, and proteins are the working molecules of the cell, they’re enzymes, they’re structural molecules, they’re are proteins that exist in the membrane that allow things to go in and out of the cell, so really the working molecules are the cell in every sense. That means the gene that encodes insulin, the sequence of base pairs that encode insulin. Well, it turns out that proteins are essential in driving this process too. In this same way, this process of transcription which is occurring in cells throughout body all the time is made possible by a protein called RNA polymerase. It allows RNA to be made from a DNA template. It’s only got one of four possible choices at each position. If I only had two per codon I wouldn’t have enough. Because brain cells and pancreas cells are expressing different proteins. When a gene gets expressed, that means its protein is produced. I want you to look at this picture, read the little bit about gene - control of gene expression - that’s in the book, know that it’s a big topic, that we’re not going to talk about it except we’re going to talk about some examples where control of gene expression can be exploited in order to treat diseases, for example."
96,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-4,"Professor Saltzman continues his presentation on DNA technology by discussing control of gene expression using two methods of RNA silencing: anti-sense therapy and RNA interference. Molecular cloning techniques to mass-produce proteins using plasmid, restriction enzymes, ligase, and antibiotic selection in bacteria are discussed. Steps and molecules involved in polymerase chain reaction are also described. Professor Saltzman explains how to detect mutations in genomic DNA, such as in sickle cell anemia patients, by gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting. Finally, he gives an example of inducing and controlling insulin expression in large animals by cloning into their genome the insulin gene with the  promoter.","So, we’re going to continue talking today about DNA. There are molecules in cells that give the DNA the signal that it’s time to transcribe and express a gene, those are called transcription factors, we’ll talk about them a bit later. One of the strands encodes the protein, encodes for the protein, the other does not. You wouldn’t want to stop insulin, for example. You might have heard about this because it’s been quite an active area of science. Certain double stranded RNA sequences will cause in the cell a process of degradation of very specific RNA sequence. Now the challenge is not just to get the DNA that encodes a gene into a cell, the challenge is to get it into the cell in a form where the cell can use it, can express it and make proteins from it. In this particular example here we’re exposing these plasmids to bacterial cells. The first step is we had to be able to take this circular DNA and cut it to create a site for our new gene to be added. That’s an example of symmetric sequence and it happens that most restriction enzymes also recognize those spaces. Or you could ask the question, I have this restriction enzyme, at what regions on this plasmid will it cut?The pasting back together occurs partly naturally by this process of hybridization, but hybridization only re-establishes the base pairing. If this reforms, so the plasmid reforms back to its native state, that resistance will be recovered. Now the problem with that is a problem I mentioned before, that most human genes are not just a straight sequence from beginning to end of the protein that you’re interested in. Plus, if you’re looking for insulin, if you’re looking for the gene for insulin you’re going to cells that are making it already, they have abundant messenger RNA so it’s much easier to separate out and identify the gene that you’re interested in. A plasmid is a highly tuned machine for making copies of itself. Now in general these are small fragments. You can also use PCR to identify specific genes that are present in a biological sample. Here’s the difference between normal hemoglobin and sickle hemoglobin, I can make - I can see a chemical difference, I can exploit it, how can I find it?Well the way to find it is by using a process called electrophoresis and Southern blotting. Charge is going to move through this gel and DNA is charged. Now something similar to this is the basis of DNA fingerprinting, that’s described in one of the boxes in your book. Well one way is to do just exactly what we talked about before. Now in this case the host - you want the host not only to replicate all the DNA, you want it also to express the gene. You’re not just trying to clone the DNA, you’re trying to also clone or make many copies of the protein. So that’s a slightly different thing, right? If that leads to the birth of a young sheep, hopefully that sheep has this gene encoded in its genome now, and it will express the protein that you wanted. One example of a way people have used this, is that they’ve taken the gene that ordinarily produces a milk protein."
97,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-5,"Professor Saltzman reviews the concept of gene therapy, and gives some examples of where this is applied. Methods to help deliver DNA into cells using viruses and cationic lipids are discussed, as a way to overcome some challenges in gene therapy. Next, Professor Saltzman gives a brief introduction into bacterial and mammalian cell physiology. He describes the different tissues in the body, the cell development/differentiation process, the anchorage dependence of mammalian cells that allows them to form an organism, and the extracellular matrix.","There were a few things I didn’t get to finish last time in talking about particularly gene transfer in mammals. We talked about this a little bit in section last week, when you eat vegetables or meat, you’re eating a lot of DNA but that doesn’t enter the cells of your body because of the barrier properties of cell membranes. You have to be able to get the DNA into the cell, it has to be incorporated into a vector of some sort, and the vector has to be compatible with the species and the cells that you’ve provided the DNA to. Cystic fibrosis is a disease that affects many organ systems, but particularly the lung. Well, now, how would you get the gene into the cells? You would like to get the gene that you’re interested in expressed in some population of cells within the body but not in other cells. Here, a concept is to introduce a gene that causes the process of new blood vessel growth. The name of the molecule isn’t important, but it’s a molecule that stimulates the heart to produce new blood vessels around it. This is introducing a gene, it’s a natural gene but it’s not - it’s a natural gene that’s found in humans and is actually expressed all over your body in different levels, but you’re concentrating it or over expressing it in one particular region of tissue in order to have a particular effect. There are other vectors that are very efficient at getting DNA into cells. That’s another advantage of using viruses as a gene therapy vector. People have tried to produce viruses that are different, adenoviruses for example, that your immune system can’t recognize. Well, you could think about the cell wall of a bacterium as its skeleton, it’s what protects it from mechanical forces that are out in the world. Bacterial cells are small, one to two microns in diameter and this shows a picture of a common bacterium called  This is a bacterium that’s normally present in humans; it colonizes all of our intestinal systems. Movement down a concentration gradient occurs fairly rapidly over short distances like a micron or so, like the size of a bacterium. Well, you know that cells in our body can reproduce. Mitosis is one event that happens during this larger event called the cell cycle. Those billions of cells come from successive rounds of cell division. Some of those differences in cells are obvious if you look at the cells in an adult organism. They make up about 45% to 50% of the volume of blood is red cells. Here’s the nucleus in the middle of the cell body and what - if you looked at a picture of a variety of different cells that were isolated from adult organisms you would recognize this immediately as a neuron or something that’s like a neuron because of the many small thin projections that come out of the body of the cell. This shows a fibroblast that is very stretched out. Remember when I showed you that picture of cells attached to plastic a few minutes ago; I said those were fibroblasts that were growing on a culture dish. The other is that this kind of adherence gives the tissue a property that’s useful, in this case the property is it can serve as a barrier to nutrients from entering our body. It’s usually colored because there’s food dye in it, but it wouldn’t be colored in its natural state."
98,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-6,"Professor Saltzman describes the processes of fertilization and embryogenesis. Professor Saltzman then talks about the definition and classification of different types of stem cells, where stem cells are found in the body, and the potential for use of stem cells in treating diseases. Some challenges in this type of therapy are also discussed. Finally, Professor Saltzman introduces the exponential equation for cell growth, , and the concept of cell “doubling time.”","Okay, today we’re going to continue our discussion of cellular principles and lead into cell culture technology which will be the subject of the section meeting this afternoon, so just to remind you about the sections. Today we want to talk in more detail about the question of how can cells–if they’re the same and they have the same kind of construction, and they all contain the same genetic material–how can they develop into a multi cellular organism that has cells that differ so greatly in function–that differ as much as the cells in our brain differ from the cells of our skin or our liver, or our blood. The sperm - say this is the one sperm cell that’s able to inject its DNA into the egg, well then this cell has a polarity. During development now this blastocyst has become implanted. As division happens and the developing organism acquires more and more cells, individual cells become differentiated, they become more and more like their final mature form. There are types of changes that are known. Then this cell is going to experience something different from this cell. That process of maturation is called differentiation. One sort of, might be kind of simple minded, but one way to think about potential is with the kind of potential that we all experience as we develop from newborns to adults, that a newborn child has lots of different potential. I’m unlikely to become a concert cellist at this point. Does this make sense?What is actually changing during this process of differentiation? It was the first place where the concept of stem cells was developed, in that if one looks carefully one can find immature cells in the bone marrow. If I could find the unique set of proteins that correspond to those genes I could define chemically what the cell is. It turns out that one of the places that’s been very fruitful to look for proteins that differ between cell populations is on the surface of the cell. We talked about the cell membrane, the plasma membrane separating the inside form the outside. They’re given names, and we’re able to - often the names are confusing, if you look in the literature you’ll find proteins that are called CD44, CD3, these are differentiation - cluster differentiation antigens is what CD stands for but it really means a particular protein which is present on this cell but not on that cell. So I can use the presence of those to identify cell populations. These signaling proteins play important roles in determining how many cells differentiate down particular pathways and they turn out also to be very useful for treating diseases of those pathways. One way of referring to this cell is in terms of its potential and the zygote obviously has the potential of becoming all of the cells of our body. That’s where they all come from, they all come from the zygote. I’m not endorsing that I’m just saying that that’s something that can be done now. I digressed a little from this diagram but I think you’ve gotten the picture that as I move to more adult organisms, as I move to more specific regions of the brain, for example, I can still find progenitor cells that have some potential. One of the main things that we use cell culture or maintenance of cells outside the body for is to make more copies of cells."
99,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-7,"Professor Saltzman talks about cell communication, specifically ligand-receptor interactions that are important in maintaining homeostasis in the body. Different types of receptors and ligands, the nature of their interactions and ways to apply this into developing drugs are discussed (eg. Aldopa, Taximofen, beta-blockers). Next, Professor Saltzman talks about kinases, phosphatases, cyclic AMP and the mechanism of switching protein states. Three categories of cell communication signals are introduced: autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine. Finally, an example of cell communication using regulation/response to blood sugar level is presented.","We’ve been talking about more basic, more biological subjects. The topic for this week is self communication: how mechanisms that cells within a complex organism use to communicate with each other at short distances or long distances. But we’re going to in class treat the physiology and the Biomedical Engineering together. The respiratory system, for example, the renal system, the digestive system, these are examples - three examples of organ systems that contact the external environment. We’ve talked about one the main concepts in physiology being homeostasis, that is ‘how do you maintain a constant internal environment? ‘. It turns out that cells receive signals or information from the rest of the body in a variety of ways, but there’s one way in particular that’s a very useful way for thinking about how cells receive most information. Because these molecules can span across the membrane from outside to inside, they’re in just the right position to take messages that they receive from outside the cell and transmit them through the membrane into the cells internal apparatus, and that’s what they do. If it was sound that was being received that might be beating of a drum, for example, that sound gets transduced. One class of them is beta-blockers, they bind to beta-adrenergic receptors, which are receptors that exchange information between your nervous system and the contractile system that beats your heart and that causes the heartbeat. It’s called the G-protein coupled receptor because it’s a receptor, like the one shown here, that’s coupled to a special molecule called a G-protein. It can ‘phosphorylate’ or add a phosphorous to another protein. This is a signal - this passing of phosphorous - is a signal that’s used very frequently in intracellular communication. One of the enzymes that often gets activated is an enzyme which converts ATP, a small molecule that is inside all of our cells. When a certain enzyme is activated inside cells, ATP gets converted into a molecule called cyclic AMP, and cyclic AMP is an example of one of these molecules called second messengers. Now, one of the advantages of having second messengers is this is one way that you can integrate between different receptor systems that are acting inside a cell. Proteins have three dimensional structures in solution and their structure determines what they do. One way that you could switch this on and off inside the cell is by taking off this phosphorous, proteins enzymes that do this opposite reaction, the opposite to kinases are called phosphokinases. Sometimes signals are transmitted between cells by cell/cell contact. An example of that is, of course, insulin which is produced by cells of the pancreas and acts on cells all over the body. Example, protein hormones are insulin which we’ve talked about before and glucagon, and growth hormone which we haven’t talked about but that’s very important during periods of life like adolescence, for example, when rapid growth of your bones is occurring. Because muscle can use and frequently is using glucose as a source of energy. Steroid hormones can operate in a different way because of their structure. A small molecule gets produced by cells in one part of the body, circulates in the blood, estrogen enters cells, and sometimes that estrogen is able to penetrate deep within the cell, even into the nucleus. Estrogen can combine with this receptor to form a new sort of unit which interacts with DNA."
100,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-8,"Professor Saltzman continues his discussion of cell communication in the body, extending the description to the nervous and immune system. Professor Saltzman describes the mode of signal transmission in neurons: action potential in the axon, and neurotransmitter release at the synaptic cleft. He also introduces elements of the innate and adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune system is presented as a host/foreign antigen recognition system involving immune cells (T, B, and macrophages), antibodies, and the major histocompatibility complex 1 and 2. Immune response by cytotoxic T cells, T helper cells, and B cells to antigen recognition are discussed in detail.","Okay, today we’re going to continue to talk about cell communication. In this case the shape is - there’s a cell body in the center here so this is where the nucleus is and where all the transcription, production of proteins take place here. The way this cell works as an information processing unit is that the dendrites, which extend out in all these different directions, are receiving information from other cells which is integrated at the position of the cell body. Well, the mechanism that the cell uses to transmit information along itself, along this process which goes from my brain to my fingers, for example, is through an electrical signal called an action potential. It sends it’s signal, it’s signal - the signal that it sends is this change in voltage, and once it changes, maybe it’s all done. The flow of information is really a flow of electrical potential and it goes in one direction only. If you could look inside a pre-synaptic axon terminal, you would find one of the characteristics is that it’s loaded with these vesicles and they’re just sitting there waiting to receive an action potential so that they can immediately dump their contents. One of the things you know about the nervous system is its fast. So, that process happens fast but you also need this neurotransmitter release and activation to happen fast so that you can have rapid activity. In some cases it might be a ligand-gated ion channel. It would generate an electrical signal because it would - you’d open the ion channel and you would ion fluxes and you would change the membrane potential in just the way I described for the action potential. So, you have both the diversity in the physical connections, any one cell is potentially contacting lots of other cells. That was the point I was trying to illustrate in the nervous system. The outcomes that occur are protective outcomes in general. Schistomiosis, which is a worm that lives in river waters, causes terrible diseases that are still prevalent in many parts of the world. So, this is an immune response that doesn’t have to be activated and we’re used to thinking about immune responses that have to be activated. It could have been corrupted because a virus was inside of it so it was making foreign proteins. So, those wrong proteins get presented on MHC1 and your immune system can kill the cell because it’s a tumor cell. They’re fully functional organisms that can reproduce on their own, and they can start growing outside of any cell and that’s what they do, they live extracellularly. Here’s where the intelligence of the immune system comes in, is that these cytotoxic T-cells that are generated only kill cells that have this signal on it. It involves thinking about antibodies and how to use antibodies and technology. We’re going to talk more about now how to use antibodies in section today. One last word of encouragement, I’ll say it again, there’s a lot of words in this chapter, there’s a lot of concepts, focus on the things that I talked about in class not the details, the basic concepts."
101,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-9,"Professor Saltzman talks about the importance of vaccines, and particularly the role of bioengineering in vaccine development. He first addresses the question of “what is a vaccine” and the role of the immune system. He then describes the biological basis, symptoms, and history of smallpox as a devastating disease worldwide, and how–starting with the work of Edward Jenner–an effective vaccine was systematically developed from cow lesions. Next, methods to deliver vaccine to a wide population are introduced. Finally, Professor Saltzman touches on the possible reemergence of smallpox as weapon for bioterrorism.",": Okay, this week we’re going to continue in our discussion about the immune system. But talk about sort of engineering the immune system, how to produce immunity in individuals. So, what that really means, you know, from last week’s lecture, is that the vaccine stimulates these particular cells in your immune system to give you immunity. Designing something that works in a particular individual, and designing something that can be used in people all over the world, involve different sorts of accomplishments. You can’t go to school in this country, and in many countries, until you’ve had your prescribed set of vaccinations. That number is undoubtedly higher than now. Children get diseases from a class of viruses called , for which we have no vaccine, and- and so no way to protect them. Just to think about what’s most important in the U.S., of the top five reported infections in the U.S., and this is again from a few years ago, but I’m fairly sure that the numbers haven’t changed, three of the top five infectious diseases, or the infectious diseases most commonly reported in the U.S., are sexually transmitted diseases: Chlamydia, gonorrhea and HIV infection. And this just is another list, I mainly wanted you to have it in your notes of diseases that are important around the world, for which there are very active programs to develop either vaccines or more effective vaccines. And so that very practical consideration turns out to be important in how we use vaccines in real populations. And so during the first period after you come in contact with the disease, you have an incubation period where you get sort of the kind of symptoms that we associate with lots of kinds of viral infections that we contract through our respiratory system; you might have a fever; a malaise, which is just that feeling that you don’t want to get out of bed and go to class. You might have that commonly, but even more severe than normal; aches; and a rash. And he hypothesized that they were getting the disease in cows, which the disease from cows that caused a milder disease than smallpox, and that protected them from getting the more severe forms of smallpox later. Well, I mentioned that this was just sort of a more modern observation of one that had been made in the past. One was, a better understanding of what you were doing when you vaccinated. And the goal was to eradicate the virus, to get rid of it so that there were no natural sources of the virus on the planet. We’ll think about it in section, how you don’t need to vaccinate everybody, but you just need to vaccinate a critical number in order to stop the disease from progressing through a community. So you need hundreds of millions of doses, at least, and you need a way to distribute that around the world, and you need a way to keep track of who got sick and who didn’t after they got vaccinated. And the engineering part of that is sort of the part that I talked about in one slide, when I talked about how do you convert this scientific advance into something that can be delivered all over the world. And those words mean different things: immunogenic means that it stimulates your immune system for a response; pathogenic means that it causes a disease. Just use a piece, an antigenic piece of the virus. Because there’s no naturally occurring smallpox. And these samples are used for scientific purposes. And so, I give you this example to say even though tremendous progress was made."
102,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-10,"In discussions of the Schrödinger equation thus far, the systems described were either one-dimensional or involved a single electron. After discussing how increased nuclear charge affects the energies of one-electron atoms and then discussing hybridization, this lecture finally addresses the simple fact that multi-electron systems cannot be properly described in terms of one-electron orbitals.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","We’re in a really great position here because we’ve gone from one dimension to three dimensions, to get something real, a real atom. Now, you can look at these pictures and ask questions, some fairly simple questions, like where is the electron density highest? Okay, so you just, to find where the density is highest, you just square the wave function and maximize it. And in fact, the two has about three times the radius of one. About nine times more volume; not of the sphere but of the shell. This happens to be the — it’s actually a 3D wave function; as you see, not from here, but from here, it’s 3D. This is the picture in three dimensions, using that ray tracing, the way we talk about. So that’s 2-dimensional, more like the contour plots we’ve been using. Here you have both, in this section, both a circle and lines. So we want simple functions at the beginning. So that’s what an H-like wave function is, just one electron, just three variables; , ,  are the convenient ones. So increasing  shrinks the wave function, makes  smaller for the same ; that is, the same height of the wave function, or the same position in the shape of the wave function, because you have to renormalize if you shrink the wave function. So the distance scale will go 1, 1/6th, 1/19th. If you shrink the distance by a factor of two, how much do you change the density? So if you look at corresponding positions in the wave function, or you look at the average potential energy, it’s going to go — it’s going to also be, take into account that the distance gets smaller,  gets smaller, because the thing got shrunken by a factor of . Remember how the kinetic energy scaled?. . Okay, so we’ve — this just summarizes — the size goes with , the electron density is proportional to, and the energy goes with , whether you’re talking potential, kinetic or total energy. You can see down here, you can do the phase and so on; the phase of makes it imaginary. No, because the atom is neutral, overall. So you can change the shape by hybridization. We can add orbitals to make an  hybrid, for example, as what would happen in an electric field. Now it’s the joint probability of electron one is here, and electron two at the same time is here; that’s the probability when you have six variables. So the total electron density should be just the sum of those. So it’s like tossing two coins to try to get to two heads. Now I’ll bet you, I’ll bet you that I can get head/head half the time, actually doing the experiment."
103,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-11,"The lecture opens with tricks (“Z-effective” and “Self Consistent Field”) that allow one to correct approximately for the error in using orbitals that is due to electron repulsion. This error is hidden by naming it “correlation energy.” Professor McBride introduces molecules by modifying J.J. Thomson’s Plum-Pudding model of the atom to rationalize the form of molecular orbitals. There is a close analogy in form between the molecular orbitals of CH and NH and the atomic orbitals of neon, which has the same number of protons and neutrons. The underlying form due to kinetic energy is distorted by pulling protons out of the Ne nucleus to play the role of H atoms.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Okay, so what’s coming for the next exam? And first we’re going to look at them in a very unconventional way, from the point of view of molecules as plum-puddings, what’s called the “United Atom” limit, to apply what we know from atoms to molecules. So if it were possible to write the six-variable, two-electron wave function as a product of one-electron wave functions, that would be a fantastic simplification, and all we’d have to do is square and we’d get the joint probability; not really that you care very much about the joint probability. But we ended the first quarter of the semester on a downer, the idea that there’s no way electrons can be independent. Why would it be different, how much you want to reduce the nuclear charge? You might think they’d be more or less the same; and they are more or less the same. No, because the  orbital dumbbell doesn’t have anything at all. But if you know where the nucleus is, or nuclei, and you know the cloud of the other electrons, and assume they’re just static clouds, then you can — it’s laborious, you need a computer to do it — but you can calculate the potential that the electron you’re interested in would have, at different positions, if there were this fixed cloud of other electrons and the nuclei. Now you’ve got an improved shape for the second electron. You’re assuming that all those other electrons, except the one you’re working on, are fixed in clouds. Because the electrons are smarter than you are. But these are better approximations than just self-consistent field. Is the whole equal to the sum of the parts, the parts being orbitals? So should we care about the error in orbital theory? So much, much smaller energy involved in putting electrons into the  shell of carbon, than in putting the carbon nucleus together. But all these things we’re looking at down below here are all based on Coulomb’s Law. So this sounds like we would really worry about it, except — so a 0.001% change in nuclear energy would overwhelm everything Coulombic. The nuclear would’ve been a disaster too. You make different errors for different arrangements of the same atoms. Or this orbital here has a conical, two cones, and a spherical node; it’s the orbital. This is not a question of joint probability. So forget, for all the elegance of that picture, forget it; they’re not showing you the truth. And then we see just a set of two atoms; it just looks like two atoms. But first — and we’ll, this is what we’re going to look at shortly — but first I want to get some insight by looking at the very lowest electron density. There are little changes because of the bonds. And if you went even further out, it would get spherical, for all you could tell. So this is nuclei embedded in a cloud of electrons. The blue one there is the lowest molecular orbital. Okay, so the core orbitals are like the  of the carbon or nitrogen atom. That’s where the protons pulled them, the potential energy. So we can compare those MOs to the AOs of Argon, which has the same number of electron pairs."
104,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-12,"This lecture begins by applying the united-atom “plum-pudding” view of molecular orbitals, introduced in the previous lecture, to more complex molecules. It then introduces the more utilitarian concept of localized pairwise bonding between atoms. Formulating an atom-pair molecular orbital as the sum of atomic orbitals creates an electron difference density through the cross product that enters upon squaring a sum. This “overlap” term is the key to bonding. The hydrogen molecule is used to illustrate how close a simple sum of atomic orbitals comes to matching reality, especially when the atomic orbitals are allowed to hybridize.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","So last time we looked at methane and ammonia, and saw something interesting about molecular orbitals: we could give them the same name as atomic orbitals; that is, if we, especially if we look at a low electron density contour of the molecular orbitals, we see that what it looks like is an atom where the nucleus is split into pieces. Now we can — as I do this, on the left side of the pictures I’m going to show one view, and then, because it’s more complicated than methane and ammonia were, I’m going to also show a picture rotated by ninety degrees. The lowest one was , then , now , if we define the horizontal axis here on the left as the x axis. But you can multiply the wave function by minus one, any constant, and it’s just as good as it was before. Now this is — if you look on the left now, it’s more clear where the nodes are, that that’s a  orbital. And here’s the ; which again, to see it well, you’d have to turn it. So you can see, especially say in the top ones, compared with the atomic orbital, that it’s exactly the same general pattern of nodes, slightly distorted. It has a fluorine, an oxygen, two carbons and five hydrogens. Therefore that atom will have fewer electrons, or lower electron density. But it has no nodes within the valence; big orbitals that we’re looking at. The orbitals must go in order of the number of nodes. So it’s a function of ; we’re talking just about electron one. Now, have you ever seen adding orbitals like that before? But this is very different, because we’re adding orbitals that are on  nuclei: A, nucleus A, and nucleus B. See the difference? Now they’re on different nuclei, what we’re adding together. Sometimes it would be near this one, sometimes it would be near this one. So the wave function, when you square it, you want it to be half looking like this atom, and half looking like this atom. But if we then subtract, what the atoms would give for electron density. So we’re actually looking for the difference density. So this is just like what we were seeing with X-ray. How about there?There’s going to be a change. So that’s the region of significant overlap, and that’s what we care about. Okay, now we can adjust the molecular orbital to get a better approximation of the true thing. Now one way to change that shape would be change how fast it falls off. And now you get a total electron density that looks essentially the same as it did before. And how has the electron density changed? In fact, this is precisely what we saw before. All that happened was that the electrons kept apart from one another, but the average density was the same. So already, with just that hybridization, we got very close to the truth in electron distribution, and three-quarters of the way to the truth in how strong a bond is. We have the atoms, plus the bond, which is the overlap, that product part."
105,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-13,Professor McBride uses this lecture to show that covalent bonding depends primarily on two factors: orbital overlap and energy-match. First he discusses how overlap depends on hybridization; then how bond strength depends on the number of shared electrons. In this way quantum mechanics shows that Coulomb’s law answers Newton’s query about what “makes the Particles of Bodies stick together by very strong Attractions.” Energy mismatch between the constituent orbitals is shown to weaken the influence of their overlap. The predictions of this theory are confirmed experimentally by measuring the bond strengths of H-H and H-F during heterolysis and homolysis.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008),"The stuff we’re doing these few days are really the focus of the first half of the semester. So what would the integral of Abe, over all space? Positive; right, the blue will overlap with the blue. So, but in the region we’re interested in, the carbon-carbon bond distances, it’s about the same. Well we won’t go through an elaborate guessing game. But at small distance, it must get much bigger, and in this region it’s crossing; so it’s bigger. Because that’s what’s building up the difference density, as we saw last time. So, and the reason they do this, as I already said, is because they allow nearly full measure of  with  overlap, plus  with , and  with , when you have mixtures. And we’ll also then think in more general terms. But you can also get that one, one with one node. So they have essentially the same energy. So that increasing overlap creates the splitting that we talk about. Now, because of that ‘a little bit greater’ and ‘a little bit less’, the energies aren’t quite, as we saw them before, equally split, up and down. When we bring the two wells together, when we bring the two atoms together, that electron will go down in energy, to the new molecular orbital. You have to put an electron up that much. It won’t, in truth, be quite twice as strong. One of them is going to have to go up instead of down. But this curve provides the potential for studying molecular vibration; that is, once you know the form of this curve, then you can use quantum mechanics for the motion of the atoms — not of the electrons but of the atoms — and figure out how atoms vibrate; which we’ve already done, when we were doing . So the one on the left is a little bit lower than the one on the right, but only a teeny bit. And notice it’s the sum, it’s a weighted sum, with no nodes. The second one, the next highest energy orbital, is the one on the right, with just a little bit of the one on the left in it; negligible amount of mixing. So the antibonding energy is rising, the bonding energy is falling — that’s why they’re antibonding and bonding — and if we bring them still closer together, we get that. So when we had the core electrons in fluoroethanol, if we had tiny orbitals that didn’t overlap, then they stayed pure. Now, so that one looks mostly like C, both in shape and in energy. Now what does this have to do with bonding? But that’s not really what we’re interested in. How many think AB is stronger, given this scheme? You can put two electrons in an orbital with opposite spin. But there’s an obvious problem with having both the electrons go to one."
106,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-14,"This lecture brings experiment to bear on the previous theoretical discussion of bonding by focusing on hybridization of the central atom in three XH molecules. Because independent electron pairs must not overlap, hybridization can be related to molecular structure by a simple equation. The “Umbrella Vibration” and the associated rehybridization of the central atom is used to illustrate how a competition between strong bonds and stable atoms works to create differences in molecular structure that discriminate between bonding models. Infrared and electron spin resonance experiments confirm our understanding of the determinants of molecular structure.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Okay, so we’re in the payoff period of having spent all this time on quantum mechanics, and we want to see first whether what we’ve done is realistic or not. And there’s a nice formula, that isn’t too hard to work out, why it should be that way, that relates  and , the values  and , to the angle that should be between them, in order to have no overlap. Let’s look at  with ;  with ; , ; and anything with . So we’re going to have  and  are both two;  is two. A  orbital, with any other hybrid, has to be perpendicular to it. So the p orbital is , and it’s perpendicular to anything else, 90º, no matter what other hybrid. So no matter whether it’s BH, CHor NH, all of them will overlap best in making three bonds, if you use So the bonds cry out, “Use ; that’ll maximize the overlap and minimize the energy of the electrons in the bonds. You want to use it where there are two electrons. CH, from the point of view of the bonds, wants to be , and the atom doesn’t care. And in nitrogen there are going to be two electrons that want to be in an orbital. Now, it turns out that BH vibrates 34-trillion times a second. So it says the springs are stiffer in BH. And remember, the frequency of light has to do with the energies of the photon. On the left, we get these lowest two energy levels and we — there’s the parabola that does the trick. And it turns out — and we don’t have time to go into this — well you know already that electrons are magnetic, and some nuclei are magnetic, and you can get a magnetic interaction between the nucleus and the electron, which influences how hard it is to change the electron from being pointing one way to being pointing another way. But there’s a neat thing about it, which is that influence can occur only when the electron is inside the nucleus. Where, in a orbital, is the highest electron density? And that implies that, on average, it’s 2% . Now, remember we already said that its lowest energy form is flat, with no . So it’s spending time with different amounts of  character, not zero, as it vibrates. So again it confirms what we’re saying, that it prefers to be flat. This is ten times almost, or whatever number of times, maybe like eight times more  character than there was in methane. Okay, now we’re going to get to what Christopher wanted, which is why the heck are we talking about bonds when we’ve been talking about molecular orbitals all the time? It has certain energies that we showed measuring by IR; although you can measure them other ways as well. So it’ll use like a limited set of atomic orbitals, only say 2 and — it won’t use the 5orbital or the 5orbital or something like that. But we have to make it simple enough to understand. But we want to understand why the computer gets that number."
107,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-15,"Professor McBride begins by using previous examples of “pathological” bonding and the BH molecule to illustrate how a chemist’s use of localized bonds, vacant atomic orbitals, and unshared pairs to understand molecules compares with views based on the molecule’s own total electron density or on computational molecular orbitals. This lecture then focuses on understanding reactivity in terms of the overlap of singly-occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs) and, more commonly, of an unusually high-energy highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) with an unusually low-energy lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). This is shown to be a generalization of the traditional concepts of acid and base. Criteria for assessing reactivity are outlined and illustrated.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Okay, so now we have a number of different perspectives we can take on understanding what holds molecules together; that is, on bonding. Now this seems funny, because the angle between the red arrows on the right carbon is greater than 90º. Why do I say it’s funny that it’s greater than — you’re not going to be able to make it 60º because two orbitals that made a 60º angle would not be independent orbitals. It’s only once they get to 90º that they can be different. So 90º is the smallest angle you could get. Why not use orbitals and make the smallest angle you can? But you get it better when they make an angle because they stretch out. So we can look at the successive layers of the onion, the high electron density, lower, lower, lower, the various contours. And we showed once before electrostatic potential, where you show that same surface but color it, to show how the electrons are distributed, and the protons in the molecule. How many independent molecular orbitals can we make, if we start with eight atomic orbitals? Okay, so these are going to be the energies that’ll turn out of the eight molecular orbitals that we’re going to get, that the computer is going to get, starting from that. So those are the Occupied Molecular Orbitals, OMO. When it doesn’t work, we must use more sophisticated orbitals, where we say there is a certain phenomenon going on. So  we’ll share with the computer; both of us see that as a lowest vacant orbital. But what I’d say, it’s going to be an orbital that’s big on hydrogen, smaller on boron; some hybrid  hybrid of boron is going to overlap with the  orbital of hydrogen. And then there would be the anti-bond, the one that’s — what’s left over, that’s big on boron, small on H, and a node between hydrogen and boron; it’s antibonding, the one that went up in energy when the atoms came together. We were too simplistic in thinking of them as independent. Suppose methane, how many molecular orbitals does it have? The lower one is bigger, so it would be even worse. Or zero, and you don’t care about the energy. So as so often in science, as the science matures, you get more and more generality to the idea. But what we deal with is things that have a lot of carbon and hydrogen in them. So it turns out that the valence orbitals of carbon, the  hybrid orbitals of carbon, and the  orbital of hydrogen, are roughly the same in energy. Because obviously if you have a negative charge, it’s not such a good place to put electrons; that means the orbitals are high in energy. And then you know that it’ll be a functional group, and you also know what it’ll react with. It has an unshared pair, only on the nitrogen. So it’s unusually low for a vacant orbital. Okay, CH is even more of a base, because carbon doesn’t have as many — as big a nuclear charge as oxygen."
108,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-16,"This lecture continues the discussion of the HOMO/LUMO view of chemical reactivity by focusing on ways of recognizing whether a particular HOMO should be unusually high in energy (basic), or a particular LUMO should be unusually low (acidic). The approach is illustrated with BH, which is both acidic and basic and thus dimerizes by forming unusual “Y” bonds. The low LUMOs that make both HF and CHF acidic are analyzed and compared underlining the distinction between MO nodes that derive from atomic orbitals nodes (AON) and those that are antibonding (ABN). Reaction of HF as an acid with OH is shown to involve simultaneous bond-making and bond-breaking.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","So this is where we were at the end last time, trying to decide when a high HOMO, or a low LUMO, is unusual in its energy; because, as the world is, things like to be at low energy. So if you want to get good energy match, and therefore mixing, and therefore bonding, the occupied orbital that you’re interested in must be unusually high, and the vacant orbital must be unusually low. These are made of carbon and hydrogen, going down. That means that you can mix the high HOMO of OH, with the low LUMO of H, and two electrons, the ones that were on the OH, go down in energy, and that makes a bond. What’s being shown by the arrow is how the electrons are moving in our picture. So most reactions that we’ll study, or at least many reactions that we’ll study of the carbon-carbon double bond, it’s reactive because of the high HOMO, not because of the low LUMO; although there are cases where the low LUMO makes it reactive. But it’s this  orbital, here, that makes it particularly remarkable, because they started a little high. And why is it further down, compared to what we usually compare? But what’s special about the C-O double bond Andrew? So what’s special here is the  is not so unusual, not so far from here. Or it could’ve been lithium that I drew here. So in fact that’s an unusual kind of bond, because it’s bonding three nuclei together, not just two. It’s just that a pair of electrons is being shared among three nuclei, rather than two, and their electron density is — correspondingly, if you did a difference density map, if you could do an X-ray of this, you’d expect electron density to build up in the middle of all three. Does the bond between three nuclei only happen — I can’t hear very well. So boron is particularly good at getting this kind of thing. On the basis of what you know, is it true that low energy molecular orbitals result in bonding? You can say something in fewer words than that. Yes, the blue one is a little bit bigger, because it’s got a little bit of the  of hydrogen lowering the energy of the  of fluorine. Here there are three going in, to give three molecular orbitals. The pink node had to do with whether it was bonding. There are nodes that were there already, atomic orbital nodes, and there are ones that are associated with the coming together, and that’s what makes something bonding, or antibonding; in this particular case it’s antibonding. But also a little bit of a  orbital on fluorine. It’s more than a  on hydrogen; that would be spherical. So this is the favorable combination of those, and this is their unfavorable combination. Is the fluorine lower, or is the C-H lower, or are they about the same? If the fluorine’s higher, and they come together, what does the low one look like? So this has three nodes that are obvious. Why is there no energy mismatch between carbon and hydrogen?"
109,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-17,"Continuing the examination of molecular orbital theory as a predictor of chemical reactivity, this lecture focuses on the close analogy among seemingly disparate organic chemistry reactions: acid-base, SN2 substitution, and E2 elimination. All these reactions involve breaking existing bonds where LUMOs have antibonding nodes while new bonds are being formed. The three-stage oxidation of ammonia by elemental chlorine is analyzed in the same terms. The analysis is extended to the reactivity of the carbonyl group and predicts the trajectory for attack by a high HOMO. This predicted trajectory was validated experimentally by Bürgi and Dunitz, who compared numerous crystal structures determined by X-ray diffraction.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Okay, so this is what we looked at last time. We’re comparing it to C-H or C-C  bonds that went down in energy. The carbon-fluorine bond is longer than the carbon-hydrogen bond. But the shape, especially around the fluorine, is almost identical. But notice, it’s, from the point of view of orbitals, exactly the same make-and-break situation that you had with OH reacting with H-F. It’s the same reaction, just the names have been changed. Okay, so we have these two reactions, acid-base reaction, SN2 Substitution. I didn’t use the true LUMO of the lowest energy, of the molecule, which I just calculated for you at the beginning of class. Look here, there’s an atomic orbital node there. So what about them could give you a high, unusually high-occupied orbital? You know, people always say electronegative, but that’s the cart and the horse. We had two chlorines, each with this odd electron. So the lowest one is , or  if you want to count the core. Which is mostly on the oxygen, a little bit on carbon. And this is drawn at a — it was based on a different calculation and it’s drawn at a different contour level. If you had to give a simple name to it, what would you call it, if you neglected the little tiny pieces on the right? But the one on the top also has an antibonding node. And there — we’re going to show this on the next slide, those two — but the top one, you see, is the favorable combination of O and ; the one of which this is the unfavorable combination. Because oxygen holds its electrons closer. So by the time you get out to a certain low — so you get through most of the electron density of oxygen, as you go out one contour by the other of the onion, that’s the oxygen; there are more electrons inside. And that’s mostly a -rich, hybrid atomic orbital of oxygen, but it’s got a little bit of the C-H bonding and it’s a favorable combination; there’s a little bit of favorable bonding between there. How do those look as ways for an orbital to come in and overlap? So you’re not going to get overlap — how about if you come from the left, the arrow on the left? So we rotate all these different structures around that carbon-oxygen bond. And now we look, with that orientation, to see where the nitrogen is nearby."
110,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-18,This lecture completes the first half of the semester by analyzing three functional groups in terms of the interaction of localized atomic or pairwise orbitals. Many key properties of biological polypeptides derive from the mixing of such localized orbitals that we associate with “resonance” of the amide group. The acidity of carboxylic acids and the aggregation of methyl lithium into solvated tetramers can be understood in analogous terms. More amazing than the panoply of modern experimental and theoretical tools is that their results would not have surprised traditional organic chemists who already had developed an understanding of organic structure with much cruder tools. The next quarter of the semester is aimed at understanding how our scientific predecessors developed the structural model and nomenclature of organic chemistry that we still use.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008),"Okay, so we’re at the conclusion of our theoretical study of bonds and reactivity, then we’ll go on to something completely different, and we’re ending by talking about reactivity in terms of four functional groups, and you’re doing your own functional groups, remember, for tomorrow. Now, if you have a single bond, it’s easy for things to rotate around it, because it’s cylindrically symmetric. Because when you rotate the nitrogen in front, like this, by 90º, you’ve wrecked the overlap that allowed those electrons to be stabilized. And this structure, the halfway-rotated structure, turns out to be 16 kilocalories less stable than the one where you do have the overlap. Because you take electrons that were on nitrogen in the amine, and you shift them into the carbonyl group. We already saw that if you want skin to work, it has to not be as reactive. Okay, the nitrogen is blue, and the oxygen is red. But you shift electrons from the nitrogen to the carbonyl group, and that is the  — pardon me, that’s the HOMO, not the , it’s the HOMO — the  electron pair, which has shifted from nitrogen and shared with the C double bond O. Now, that sharing, as we just said on the previous slide, creates an electric dipole. Not only there, but there are other ones too, like here, a chain of them there, and another chain down here at the bottom. So this atom, this atom, this atom and this atom are all in the same plane. Now, if you had just a regular old alcohol, it can dissociate as an acid. But there’s another way you can say it, just in terms of HOMO/LUMO mixing. There’s an electron pair here that mixes with a vacant orbital. But with the other one, because the H isn’t there, it’s actually making it more stable. The HOMO here is an unshared pair on oxygen. That means that the electrons here are more stable, lower in energy. But if you see the one that the computer has drawn, at least in some cases you can make some guesses about it. This is something you can do in your head, and that’s what we’re going to show, these different points of view with this one. But just you have two atoms and they come together. What is it besides overlap that determines how far they go? Where will it be, on the carbon or on the lithium? Now, but the LUMO+1 is this orbital, which I’ve drawn in a funny way, at a relatively high electron density contour, making the things very small. It’s the  and  bonds of carbon and hydrogen which — and this, the LUMO here is higher than that of lithium — lithium’s unusually low — because it’s still an atomic orbital, it didn’t mix with anything. But at the same time we can go the other way and the HOMO on the top can be stabilized by the LUMO on the bottom. But it’s going to be rotated 90º. So those are the same two orbitals, LUMO+1 in both cases. This one looks mostly like the HOMO of this dimer. And this is about as complex as we’re ever going to get. Because as we go on and get lore, that this reacts with this and gives this, what I want you to be able to do is to look at it and say, ah ha, that’s what happened, that’s why that reacted that way. Okay, so how many people cannot come Thursday evening, 8:00? So here’s CH methane; obviously they knew that. Mortar and pestle; they could grind things up."
111,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-19,"This lecture begins a series describing the development of organic chemistry in chronological order, beginning with the father of modern chemistry, Lavoisier. The focus is to understand the logic of the development of modern theory, technique and nomenclature so as to use them more effectively. Chemistry begins before Lavoisier’s “Chemical Revolution,” with the practice of ancient technology and alchemy, and with discoveries like those of Scheele, the Swedish apothecary who discovered oxygen and prepared the first pure samples of organic acids. Lavoisier’s  launched modern chemistry with its focus on facts, ideas, and words. Lavoisier weighed gases and measured heat with a calorimeter, as well as clarifying language and chemical thinking. His key concepts were conservation of mass for the elements and oxidation, a process in which reaction with oxygen could make a “radical” or “base” into an acid.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","So we know something about all these powerful tools that had been developed: quantum mechanics around 1925, ‘26 actually; and then all these much more modern things, including scanning probe microscopy, which is really quite recent. And, for that, we go back in time and look at these guys in the nineteenth century who invented it. Here’s a painting of an alchemist from 1663. That’s just my own theory, so maybe that’s wrong. He’s before the Chemical Revolution, but he’s an important precedent, as you’ll see, to the Chemical Revolution. Okay, so uric acid is indeed an acid, like carboxylic acids. Being way down, it’s got lots of protons and neutrons and is very, very dense. But the book starts, as I’ll show you here — sorry, there we go — the book starts with an introduction, a “,” which is translated, it says, from Swedish. And here, in 1774, is his draft of a letter that he wrote to France. And it begins — or it actually begins with a couple of words on the previous sheet — but it says: “…since I have no large burning glass, I beg you to try with yours…” Because he had to do this by heating things in an oven, at a really high temperature, which was hard to do. But that letter, although it was sent, was never answered. in Latin; and you know lots of words come from , like radish is a root. This is not the original French, but it’s the first English translation, which you see comes from the Yale University Library, back when. I showed you that picture earlier, said we’d refer to it again. It’ll turn out that the most important thing for Lavoisier, and for the whole 19th Century — all this development that led to bonds and their arrangement — weighing was the key thing. Boyle is the only person on the front of the building older than Lavoisier. And now, at this point you know that the pressure of that gas is atmospheric pressure, less whatever the height of the mercury column is. And he knows how much volume, how much pressure. Okay, here he is working with one of these bell jars. But don’t lift it high, hold it above the thing. “The impossibility of separating nomenclature of a science from the science itself, is owing to this, that every branch of physical science must consist of three things; the series of  which are the object of the science, the  which represent these facts, and the  by which the ideas are expressed. Facts, ideas and words, and they all have to tie into one another as impressions of the same seal. But, for Lavoisier, or for chemists, those are elements, because you don’t break them apart. And this is the calorimeter manufactured and used by Lavoisier; and also Laplace, a younger man who was his colleague, who became a great mathematician, as you probably know. There was a symposium, down the hill, sponsored by the library, including the guy that wrote that . So oxygen is the element that generates sourness, that generates acid. Lithic acid was another one that I didn’t mention before, which comes from stones; see, it’s from urinary calculus."
112,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-1,"Professor McBride outlines the course with its goals and requirements, including the required laboratory course. To the course’s prime question “How do you know” he proposes two unacceptable answers (divine and human authority), and two acceptable answers (experiment and logic). He illustrates the fruitfulness of experiment and logic using the rise of science in the seventeenth century. London’s Royal Society and the “crucial” experiment on light by Isaac Newton provide examples. In his correspondence with Newton Samuel Pepys, diarist and naval purchasing officer, illustrates the attitudes and habits which are most vital for budding scientists - especially those who would like to succeed in this course. The lecture closes by introducing the underlying goal for the first half of the semester: understanding the Force Law that describes chemical bonds.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","So for 150 years organic chemistry courses have tended to acquire a daunting reputation. So you get assigned to do, to cover a couple frames of the PowerPoint. Okay, but in order to get credit for it you have to get it by the night after the lecture. So these are graduate students in chemistry and they run these discussion sections. Typically you have a 50-minute discussion section. So really, for the bookkeeping purposes of the department you have to sign up for a section. And we’re blessed with three alumni, seniors who took this course as freshmen, who act as what are called peer tutors, and they’ll run a session Sunday evening, from eight to ten p.m. is the current plan. Actually, if you check, you’ll find that — and also you get 50 points for participation in the Wiki, and the total is 650 points, that’s what your exam is based on. But that is the main question, how do you know what these things that they told you in school?Well, there are four ways we can talk about of knowing, and two of them are shown on this manuscript from the Carolingian book painter. I could trust a fact and always cross-examined an assertion. So the third way of knowing is by experimental observation. And the lecture is a little bit more focused on logic and the lab is more focused on experiment, and you get an unbalanced view if you do one without the other. And if you get another 100 years you get to Newton and gravitation; and we’ll talk a little bit about that. And these things all have something in common. And here’s a cartoon that shows him — it’s a modern cartoon — imagining him in a class at Cambridge. So artificial experiments designed to decide a question; experiments.) “ And this is why they wrote the history, to try to make the case for being supported. Because that was his crucial experiment; and here’s his diagram in that experiment with a prism in it. What do you associate with Samuel Pepys?Newton-Pepys Problems. And on July Fourth, 1662 — it’s the fourth of July but it’s more than 100 years before that became relevant — he writes in his diary, “By and by comes Mr. Cooper, mate of the , of whom I intend to learn mathematiques, and do begin with him to-day, he being a very able man… After an hour’s being with him at arithmetique (my first attempt being to learn the multiplication-table); we then parted till tomorrow. ”So here was the guy doing all the purchasing for the Royal Navy and he didn’t know multiplication, let alone division. So get together in a group, parcel out who works on what, discuss what went on and so on. You can tell where hydrocarbons came from sometimes that way. So Robert Boyle — notice he’s right at that time, 1627 to 1691, and he’s the oldest person that’s on the Honor Roll outside the building here, he’s over that way — so Robert Boyle wrote this first important book in chemistry,  . So he developed this science on the basis of a new instrument, the pneumatical engine, which was built by Robert Hooke, the guy we quoted. There was a coil in the spring that he depended on. So this is what he published at the end of this book on helioscopes, and that is an anagram of how springs work, so that later he could prove that he knew it, if needs be, but no one could steal it in the meantime."
113,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-20,"This lecture traces the development of elemental analysis as a technique for the determination of the composition of organic compounds beginning with Lavoisier’s early combustion and fermentation experiments, which showed a new, if naïve, attitude toward handling experimental data. Dalton’s atomic theory was consistent with the empirical laws of definite, equivalent, and multiple proportions. The basis of our current notation and of precise analysis was established by Berzelius, but confusion about atomic weight multiples, which could have been clarified early by the law of Avogadro and Gay-Lussac, would persist for more than half a century.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Okay, as you may remember, way back before the exam, we’d started looking at how things really happened, how people were able to figure out about bonds, and how atoms were arranged, and molecules reacted, before there were the powerful techniques that we — that developed mostly in the last twenty-five or thirty years, as far as their practical application in organic chemistry; but how they found these out before that time. For example, carbonous acid was not known at that time; you see in the second entry in the second row, second column. He didn’t use the peroxy acid, as we would often use nowadays. But he used, for example, oxygenated nitric acid, which was unknown. So these - and - names, that we still use, come directly from Lavoisier. So at the end of the experiment you weigh how much water there is in the jar and how much the calcium chloride has increased in weight, and that tells you how much water there was. So he had to know what percent, by weight, water is, of hydrogen. And if know what fraction of CO is carbon — and there’s a homework problem for Friday that you can look at. So that’s fine if it’s a hydrocarbon oil. So it takes at least three or four people to run this thing. So you have to have something that catches the foam so it won’t get into your device. No, I can’t imagine that would happen, right? Okay, and now he does — he looks at the products, and he has a certain amount of CO that he collected; that’s carbonic acid. And he knows how much oxygen and charcoal; there is that. So all the carbon and some of the water has gone. Now, if you recalculate, by modern theory, how much gas you should get from twenty-eight grains of carbon doing this, you should get 157 cubic inches and 313 cubic inches, instead of 144 and 380; you should get 103 grains of carbonic gas and 9.4 grains of flammable gas. This idea of facts and ideas and words having to go together and improve together. But also, in the case of gases, volume, but measuring the density, so that you can relate volume to mass, which is the fundamental quantity. And if we can’t break them down further, we’ll assume for the time-being that they are elements, but maybe that they won’t be in the long run. And then in 1801 carbonic acid, as it was called, was analyzed and found to be twenty-one grams of carbon to seventy-two grams of oxygen. And that’s what you would expect, if these things were made up of identical molecules with simple ratios of numbers of atoms in them. Remember, we just saw that these previous ones were off by as much as 10 or 11%, but he got very good ones for fifty different elements. He studied electrolysis, which we will see, and used that to develop the theory of dualism and how — understanding reactions as double decompositions; and we’ll shortly see what that is. So notice as — so there were alchemical symbols at the beginning for Dalton, as you went across, but in the next row, once you get to iron, which is Fe in Berzelius, can you see what it is? I’m sorry it’s not such a good resolution. H. HO, or his circle with a dot in the circle. But Berzelius’s don’t, they’re just a list of the elements and the ratio, by weight, of atoms in them. The reason is that he felt there was water in these acids. Berzelius thought it was SiCland Odling in England thought it was SiCl. And how much hydrogen would he have gotten from nitrogen?"
114,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-21,"The most prominent chemist in the generation following Lavoisier was Berzelius in Sweden. Together with Gay-Lussac in Paris and Davy in London, he discovered new elements, and improved atomic weights and combustion analysis for organic compounds. Invention of electrolysis led not only to new elements but also to the theory of dualism, with elements being held together by electrostatic attraction. Wöhler’s report on the synthesis of urea revealed isomerism but also persistent naiveté about treating quantitative data. In their collaborative investigation of oil of bitter almonds Wöhler and Liebig extended dualism to organic chemistry via the radical theory.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Welcome to the parents who’ve made it today. Okay, so now we’re going to talk about atomic weights and equivalents and what was involved there. Gay-Lussac went with the volumes of the gases that were involved, which turned out ultimately to be correct, although it wasn’t really widely accepted for about sixty years. Then he assembled this thing along the bottom so that the gases that came out, after the water was removed, would exit and be collected in this bell jar, over mercury. By this arrangement, some brilliant phenomena were produced. “A small piece of pure potash, which had been exposed for a few seconds to the atmosphere, so as to give a conducting power to the surface, was placed upon an insulated disc of platina, connected with the negative side of the battery in the power of 250 of 6 and 4, in a state of intense activity; and a platina wire, communicating with the positive side, was brought in contact with the upper surface of the alkali. … In addition to sodium and potassium, boron, magnesium, calcium and barium were all due to Sir Humphry Davy. So, notice that this is our family tree, you’ll remember, and now we’ve looked at elemental analysis, atoms and dualism. How many people have heard about Wöhler and urea? Or you can test… So it doesn’t behave like an ammonium salt. So he could calculate for a substance of that formula what the percent by weight should be. No, no, the first is Prout’s analysis, the first column; the last column is Berzelius-Wöhler theory; and the middle is what we think is correct, because it’s based on what we have now. So how do you do that and not get it to add to 100%? What he reported was not actually experimental. We’re not going to talk about things that go over the whole molecule. But if you have these two things, you could react them with one another. Is there such a salt, or does it always change to urea? and of a liquid hydrocarbon and the olefiant gas. By isomeric substances, I understand those which posses the same chemical composition and the same atomic….” Okay, so there’s more to chemistry than the analytical composition, which is what they were good at measuring. Or, if any of you are student members of the American Chemical Society, that’s on the logo. Okay, it came through a drying agent, that collected the water that was a product. And the way it worked was it was tilted a little bit. And you had to put it this way, not this way. You stopped the fire, and it would suck back. So here’s a portrait, a little bit later portrait, of Liebig, after he had gone to Munich to be a big wheel. He must’ve told hundreds of students over the years, “Look, when you put it together, you put it this way, not this way.” You must not travel, you must busy yourself, but not in Cassel. So then in July Wöhler says it came: “The oil of bitter almonds has come with the books from Paris. I’ve kept half of it and am herewith sending you the rest."
115,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-22,"Work by Wöhler and Liebig on benzaldehyde inspired a general theory of organic chemistry focusing on so-called radicals, collections of atoms which appeared to behave as elements and persist unchanged through organic reactions. Liebig’s French rival, Dumas, temporarily advocated radicals, but converted to the competing theory of types which could accommodate substitution reactions. These decades teach more about the psychology, sociology, and short-sightedness of leading chemists than about fundamental chemistry, but both theories survive in competing schemes of modern organic nomenclature. The HOMO-LUMO mechanism of addition to alkenes and the SOMO mechanism of free-radical chain reactions are introduced.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","So in 1832, as we saw at the end last time, Wöhler went to work for most of a month with Liebig, and together they worked on the oil of bitter almonds, which is making its way around — it’s benzaldehyde — which is making its way around here. Benzaldehyde is the  of bitter almonds; not the solid of bitter almonds. So what did it react with, in the bottle? So if you denote the benzoyl radical by Bz — you see that you started, the oil of bitter almonds is BzH, and then the acid is BzOH, and the acid chloride is BzCl and Br and I and NH and two Bz’s, together with S, at the end. It was transferred from the idea of shining, to the idea of the clear sky, and from that to a colorless liquid. You can have two ethyl radicals with oxygen. And he was a persistent opponent of Liebig and Berzelius. So this is five years after the Radical Theory began. Well, we are not afraid to say it, and it is not an assertion which we make lightly: this great and beautiful question is today answered; it only remains to follow through on all the consequences which the solution entails. ”Great and beautiful questions to answer. Now, but there was a problem with dualism. We can think about mechanisms; in fact, two ways that the hydrocarbon could fix chlorine. So, in fact, both those things happen at once. The blue orbitals overlap and mix, shift electrons toward the other one; the chloride breaks away. Can you see what would be reactive about that cation intermediate? You got carbon-carbon or carbon-chlorine. Now what are you going to — there’s the low LUMO. And what you can do is — I’ve made it in this weird color, which is hard to see. And notice that we draw curved arrows for that too, but you draw arrows with a single barb rather than a double barb, when it’s just one electron rather than a pair of electrons that’s executing the motion we’re talking about. And now we can do the trick with the chlorine atom, because we have this SOMO, and it can mix with the C-H bond to make a new bond; that is, one electron in the C-H bond now goes each way. But bromobutane is not two words, it’s one word. But the interesting thing about that, it’s not transformation, but that this is the first time the letter R was used, to talk about a generic radical; “R” stands for radical. And it begins with this question, number one there: “Can one substitute the elements that play their role in any simple or compound substance equivalent for equivalent?” And you won’t be surprised that in 40 pages he concludes the answer is yes. And after that lengthy paper, there’s a letter, “,” with a footnote that says it was a letter to Justus Liebig. And it’s the only paper that’s in French, in his particular issue. So these two theories were competing with one another."
116,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-23,"Youthful chemists Couper and Kekulé replaced radical and type theories with a new approach involving atomic valence and molecular structure, and based on the tetravalence and self-linking of carbon. Valence structures offered the first explanation for isomerism, and led to the invention of nomenclature, notation, and molecular models closely related to those in use today.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","So we’re going through the development of the theory and practice of organic chemistry, generation by generation. And in the meantime Kekulé published, which irritated Couper no little, and he told Wurtz what he thought about it, which was why he got sacked. “Among those which have been lately developed, there is one, on account of its apparent numerous merits, which particularly claims investigation, and respecting which we deem that it would not be unprofitable were either new proofs of its scientific value furnished or, on the contrary, should considerations be adduced establishing not only its inadequacy to the explanation, but its ultimate detriment to the progress of science. Were he to begin by saying that he had discovered a certain word which would serve as a type” (remember there were four types; water, ammonia, HCl and hydrogen) “and from which by substitution and double decomposition all the others are to be derived, that he by this means not only could form new words, but new books, and books almost ad infinitum; he would state certainly an empirical truth. At the same time, however, this method would, judged by the light of common sense, be an absurdity. So this was not likely to make him popular in Paris. But at any rate, he got in trouble because of this. It’s because he wasn’t dealing with the right atomic weights, right? But those are the atomic weights he’s using, in order to get these formulas. So now his formulas are going to be more like ours, without the C. So he has a formula for glycerin, and one for glyceric acid. Because carbon can bond to carbon; that’s the special thing about it. And that’s the correct structure for glucose, if it’s hydrated. This is a good exercise for reviewing what we’ve been doing. Instead of drawing OH here — and notice — yeah, instead of drawing OOH here, for a second, he added — he’s got the wrong formula, he’s got H there. Okay, this is a drawing that Kekulé made at the age of thirteen. And we’ll talk a lot about this guy on the right here. ”So 1859 is at the time he was proposing valence and so on; 1858, as I remember. Here’s the origin; I’m going to give this 1.238 and so on. So, and you need to be able to show isomers, which Berzelius couldn’t show. But we’ve got a methyl substituted in it. So he gave this public lecture where he used croquet balls for atom models, with sticks stuck in them, and he colored them, and the system he chose is the one we still use for what color the atoms are: white for hydrogen, red for oxygen, blue for nitrogen, black for carbon. By this time Hofmann was back in Germany. But they got a guy in Spain to make some Hofmann-style models. So suppose we substitute another chlorine. So, but these constitutional models try to show the nature and sequence of bonds for Hofmann, not the arrangement in space; and not for Hofmann, and not for the guy that made these models. So that comes a little later, trying to get to the arrangement in space. But the  of Hofmann’s lecture was this: that if you take these croquet ball models and make the olefiant gas, which we talked about last time, it’s got two spare valences, and if you add chlorine you can get the dutch liquid, the dichloroethane. But that was what he really showed, was that the model had something completely new that no one anticipated."
117,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-24,"Half a century before direct experimental observation became possible, most structures of organic molecules were assigned by inspired guessing based on plausibility. But Wilhelm Körner developed a strictly logical system for proving the structure of benzene and its derivatives based on isomer counting and chemical transformation. His proof that the six hydrogen positions in benzene are equivalent is the outstanding example of this chemical logic but was widely ignored because, in Palermo, he was far from the seats of chemical authority.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","We’ve been going through the generations of organic chemistry, from Lavoisier to Berzelius and Gay-Lussac, to Dumas, Liebig and Woehler, and last time we got to Couper, and began with Kekulé, talking about their discovery, or invention really, of valence; in particular the tetravalence and the self-linking of carbon. And the origin of the name is interesting. But, in fact, only one was known, monobromo. That’s consistent with its being a hexagon. And if you go to four, five, six, it’s the same thing, except hydrogens are what you count instead of bromines. The analysis obviously is going to be the same, because they’re isomers. But if you do, then you can count isomers. Okay?In fact, the paper that I xeroxed this from had written in, in old brown ink, the letters from the bottom , going around the ring, for . The purple and the red are the same — You say the purple and the red are the same. So those are different, if this model is faithful in that respect. And — that one, remember, is called Dewar benzene — and the one that’s not included was prismane or what’s called “Ladenburg” benzene. because of the way it was put together by losing waters between them. So Palermo is down there on the northwest coast of Sicily. But anyhow, Koerner wrote in this paper, in 1869:“The dogma of the impossibility of determining the atomic constitution of substances, which until recently was advocated with such fervor by the most able chemists, is beginning to be abandoned and forgotten; and one can predict that the day is not far in the future when a sufficient collection of facts will permit determination of the internal architecture of molecules. This was proven, in this paper in 1869, by Koerner. How many isomers would you get if there were four different? But you can do the same trick with parahydroxybenzoic acid, and you get the same phenol, not a different one. So OH is in the position of Hω; that we know, in all three compounds. Probably take the OH off and leave the COOH on. So the three sites of COOH are equivalent, and we can name them x and y and z. None of them can be exactly the same, because if they were exactly the same then those hydroxybenzoic acids, two of them at least, would’ve been the same, if the COOHs — because we know the OHs were the same. In this particular case, ω would be the same as x, y and z, as a site for a single substituent, if it were this structure. Now, you replace the NH by Br — and we’ll talk about these next semester, what particular reactions did that — and then you change NO to NH, and then you replace the NH by chlorine. One of them is ω bromide y chloride, and the other has them exchanged. So there must be at least four equivalent substituted positions: ω, y, x and z. Okay? Now that would be consistent with that pentagonal pyramid, right? But you can’t get three different disubstituted ones among those positions. One would have one bromine on each carbon and one would have two bromines on one carbon. In the phase of rotation, around the carbon-carbon single bond."
118,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-25,"Despite cautions from their conservative elders, young chemists like Paternó and van’t Hoff began interpreting molecular graphs in terms of the arrangement of a molecule’s atoms in 3-dimensional space. Benzene was one such case, but still more significant was the prediction, based on puzzling isomerism involving “optical activity,” that molecules could be “chiral,” that is, right- or left-handed. Louis Pasteur effected the first artificial separation of racemic acid into tartaric acid and its mirror-image.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Okay, I need two volunteers here at the beginning, while we’re waiting for everybody else to come in. So we’ve got two spices here that we need to identify. Okay, so as we were closing last time we were looking at this definite picture of the arrangement of atoms in space, where the models are clearly real models, held together by rubber tubing, and they’re tetrahedral, and it explains why there can be three isomers of disubstituted — symmetrically disubstituted — ethane. But now we’re in configuration, how things are attached to the tetrahedron. Remember one could’ve been straight, one crooked, short, long or something like that.)“I believe, however, that I don’t err when I suppose that the same cause which keeps me from accepting it will also keep all the other chemists from doing so, in a silent agreement with one another. But since we have no means to know the topographic position of the atoms, while we have many to know how they are connected to one another, I consider it a bit dangerous for science. Both conditions could, however, be fulfilled through alternative formulas which, so far as I know, have not been proposed before.” So anyhow, this young student, twenty-four years old now, says Ladenburg’s off base in saying the prism is better, because it has the same problem and you can’t get out of it with this vibration thing. This, as drawn, it has a triangle on top. And if it’s in three dimensions, then AB goes left to right, in one, and right to left in the other, and you can’t superimpose them, they’re not the same thing; according to van’t Hoff. ”Okay, now how could the prism be identical to this? So as long as you don’t have dashed lines for 3D, they’re the same; one is just twisted. Or if you make it, it immediately transforms to the other one. Any property that those two bottles differ in? I’ll tell you the measure of this, which is you have light that’s polarized. So how many degrees per mole, you might say. So different colors in the spectrum are being blocked out. So we block off different colors at different angles. So that’s the color that was used, because it was easy to generate in the old times. And you correctly identified a difference between them, that one has a hydrogen pointing backwards and the other coming out toward you. Oh pardon me, vice-versa from what I said there. So obviously they’re quite different from one another. Sometimes too many isomers are predicted, like Paternó’s dibromoethane. He had different phases of rotation; said those were different. But always only four of them are observed, in sodium ammonium tartrate; not all eight. So he thought untwisted molecules would be what’s called “holohedral”; that is, have all their faces."
119,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-26,"With his tetrahedral carbon models van’t Hoff explained the mysteries of known optical isomers possessing stereogenic centers and predicted the existence of chiral allenes, a class of molecules that would not be observed for another sixty-one years. Symmetry operations that involve inverting an odd number of coordinate axes interconvert mirror-images. Like printed words, only a small fraction of molecules are achiral. Verbal and pictorial notation for stereochemistry are discussed.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","At the end last time we saw this intemperate quote from Hermann Kolbe on the young van’t Hoff: “The fancy trifles in it” (his book about the arrangement of atoms in space) “are totally devoid of any factual reality.” That’s not what happens to the plane of light as it goes. But this is twisting the direction that the electric vector oscillates. That it’s identical in every respect, except it’s all different. In the case of tartaric acid, after Pasteur, they had that. Down here, this carbon that was red here, has two hydrogens on it. That you get — when you start with tartaric acid and pull off the water. And what he shows here is you can rotate that freely. And you can’t go back and forth between those by rotating, because they’re in a certain order. What you need to do is to twist it, like that, so that the groups, CH and CH, come in and out of the plane. Okay, so we want to count how many different mono-substituent positions there are in that compound. Okay, and notice that this one, the third one in, has exactly the same arrangement among the hydrogens as the first one. I’ll not go through these — notice — except to note in this one that there’s obviously top here and these three. How does the mirror know which way gravity points? Because if I look like this, and I go like this, you expect it to change, the right hand, because you’re accustomed to people rotating. And it turned out that John Tenniel was blind in one eye; a fact I only discovered yesterday, on Wikipedia. ”Because in the college Carroll knew Vernon Harcourt, who was a chemist who was involved in this work, with Wislicenus. And this is a right hand, incidentally, not a left hand. And if I rotate it, it would look like that, right? But we can occupy the other four as well. For example, we can change the sign of all  and , but leave  the same. Now, this is a special property, handedness. And the voice of the people is the voice of God. Like a propeller is chiral; it has rotational symmetry. And now we’re going to go into configuration and conformation, the other two Cs. And you won’t be surprised to hear that there are some bonds that are so easy to break that it’s easier to convert those configurational isomers than it is to convert certain conformational isomers; where formally all you have to do is rotate about a bond, but in the process other things run into one another and make it very difficult. But then you can get from one to another."
120,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-27,"It is important that chemists agree on notation and nomenclature in order to communicate molecular constitution and configuration. It is best when a diagram is as faithful as possible to the 3-dimensional shape of a molecule, but the conventional Fischer projection, which has been indispensable in understanding sugar configurations for over a century, involves highly distorted bonds. Ambiguity in diagrams or words has led to multibillion-dollar patent disputes involving popular drugs. International agreements provide descriptive, unambiguous, unique, systematic “IUPAC” names that are reasonably convenient for most organic molecules of modest molecular weight.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","We’re talking about facts, ideas and words, in relation to stereochemistry. So you have to use your stereochemical intuition sometimes to interpret that. They’d be 120° angles, or something like that. He wrote:“With the help of Friedländer’s convenient rubber models, one can construct molecules of right-handed tartaric acid, left-handed tartaric acid, and inactive tartaric acid and lay them in the plane of the paper so that the four carbon atoms are in a straight line and the attached hydrogens and hydroxyls lie above the plane of the paper. But he says what you’re going to do is take the four carbons that are in a chain — this is tartaric acid, here’s CO, carbon with an OH, carbon with an OH and a carbon with O on it, right? And then you understand that the bonds between them are severely bent. So that the curious thing is that when you draw a Fischer projection, as is most convenient for sugars, for discussing the configuration of sugars, the bond, the four bonds for this carbon are understood that these two, the horizontal ones, come out toward you, as if they were wedges, and the other two from this carbon go back into the board. So you could rotate it 180°, but you can’t rotate it 90°. And notice that these terms name relationships. If you rotate them, they become the same thing they were originally, right? Now how about the first one in the bottom row here? And that became very important in the chemistry of sugars, where Fischer was deeply involved, as we’ll see next semester. Yeah, four different things, because you have to count the hydrogen. So here’s what they’re comparing in the two different things. And the estimated primary completion date is September 2011. So these are very, very long, expensive things, to try to get a drug that will work. It certainly doesn’t show 109° angles, but it’s — and this dash should be up here, to be even close. So does the patent cover Lipitor or doesn’t it, was the question for the judge. He said:“In the ‘633 patent,” (when they talk about patents they just talk about the last three digits, not the big number) “it is absolutely clear from context throughout that formula (1) is being used to denote a racemate.” ( ”So the person without any creativity knows that yes, the patent described the racemate, but there’ll be one in there that I can get, and that’ll be the useful drug. They put out a press release saying this is a victory for science. Then they had to agree on how to describe it, on what the nomenclature and the notation should be. So they had to devise rules for what you want to do when you make a name for a compound. But this is what we were just talking about. So everybody will have the same name for the compound. It should be possible to write it fairly quickly. Okay, so the first thing you do, these people decided, when you get together, is decide what the main chain of carbons is. Because that will provide the root with a Greek designation that says what the number of things is. So you choose the one on the top, not the one in the middle."
121,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-28,"Determination of the actual atomic arrangement in tartaric acid in 1949 motivated a change in stereochemical nomenclature from Fischer’s 1891 genealogical convention (D, L) to the CIP scheme (R, S) based on conventional group priorities. Configurational isomers can be interconverted by racemization and epimerization. Pure enantiomers can be separated from racemic mixtures by resolution schemes based on selective crystallization of conglomerates or temporary formation of diastereomers.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Okay, today in the  there was a report of a clinical trial, which event, the kind of thing we talked about on Friday. But since arrangement in space is also important, you have to be able to have names for stereochemistry. So the top is the mirror image of the bottom. But we don’t know exactly how we should draw it — right? — Capital D is the name he used, and that big D-glyceraldehyde, he guessed — the one that rotates light to the right — he guessed had that structure, which when drawn with a Fischer projection is that structure. So he said this now gives us a starting point. So you have to do some chemical transformations. For example, someone else might go into a lab and they want to prepare tartaric acid from -glyceraldehyde. So you don’t need to know how it was synthesized or anything. And we can draw them that way as well; near on the left and far on the right. And if you heat these molecules further, the one on the left can lose water and form an anhydride, but not the one on the right. But as to whether to say the molecule itself is  or , you have to know which one you’re talking about, on the right. Which one do you think should have higher priority? How about on this end, CH or COOH, which should have higher priority? Once you find a difference you stop, so you don’t have to go everywhere. Okay, so on the left, in each case, you have a carbon compared to a hydrogen as the thing that’s immediately attached. You don’t really have — in the second part of the double bond, as a substituent, and that itself is like  or . If it’s isotopes, you take the heavier one. Okay?Now there’s another — there are lots of tricks to do this. Pretend that this is a steering wheel of a car, and the H is going back in. So that one’s a left turn and that one’s a right turn. A conglomerate is a mixture of crystals where each crystal is all one hand or all the other hand; but it’s a 50:50 mixture of such crystals. And then you can filter it and you have just that one. Okay, so that’s one way that’s actually used industrially, as well as in the lab. So if what I did was make diastereomers by adding something else to these molecules, which itself is only one hand, like right, now I’ll have things that reacted that are right with right, and things that are reacted right with left. So one will come out the bottom of the column faster. That’s one way of making temporary diastereomers; or making a compound with a chiral-resolved mate. There’s brucine; that’s one of these alkaloids. And you see it has all those centers, stereogenic centers. And it recrystallized and didn’t change it."
122,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-29,"Within a lecture on biological resolution, the synthesis of single enantiomers, and the naming and 3D visualization of omeprazole, Professor Laurence Barron of the University of Glasgow delivers a guest lecture on the subject of how chiral molecules rotate polarized light. Mixing wave functions by coordinated application of light’s perpendicular electric and magnetic fields shifts electrons along a helix that can be right- or left-handed, but so many mixings are involved, and their magnitudes are so subtle, that predicting net optical rotation in practical cases is rarely simple.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","So you remember Pasteur was very fond of racemic and tartaric acid. Natural things, enzymes and so on, can distinguish between the two hands, and naturally the stuff that normally eats tartaric acid is going to eat normal tartaric acid, not the unusual one. The other ones they just had to hope, and fiddle around with different reactions until they found one that would do the trick. But we don’t know that; at least I don’t know that. He was the first person to introduce the word  into science. He’s best known for inventing the absolute Kelvin temperature scale. So whenever you use the absolute temperature scale now in the future, you can picture this idyllic scene. Anyway, so he was the first to introduce the word  into science. And if you put in — if you reverse the direction of the magnetic field, relative to the light beam, you’ll get an equal and opposite sense of optical rotation. A pseudoscalar is a number that changes sign under reflection or inversion; we’ll leave it at that. So now we bring in circularly polarized light. Now you know that light involves electromagnetic oscillations in space, and usually you just think of the oscillating electric vector of a light wave, and if it’s linearly polarized, it’s oscillating in one plane. There’s actually also an oscillating magnetic field vector that oscillates perpendicular to the electric. And what happens is you get this circular polarization. Now this picture here, this represents the instantaneous electric vectors at different points in space, in the direction of propagation, along the  direction. And there it is for left-circularly polarized. Now chiral molecules respond slightly differently to right and left-circularly polarized light. Anyway, there’s a differential absorption of right and left-circularly polarized light. And it’s this — these electric dipole transitions, like this, that’s behind conventional spectroscopy. But this is a very important feature here. However, you wouldn’t want to go on and actually calculate the optical rotation of the carbonyl chromophore, in some situation from this. So you can calculate this whole thing, , and taking in however many excited states in the sum are necessary. Many drugs now are chiral, and drug companies like to market now single enantiomer versions of the drug. But even then, you can occasionally make a mistake. Here we’ve been looking at optical activity in electronic transitions, using visible light. You’re not specifically responsible for it, but it’s review. On five, there’s a methoxy group, which appears first among all the things in this — named here; not the thing that’s on two. So the image in the middle of the three seems to be in 3-D. Okay."
123,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-2,"Professor McBride begins by following Newton’s admonition to search for the force law that describes chemical bonding. Neither direct (Hooke’s Law) nor inverse (Coulomb, Gravity) dependence on distance will do - a composite like the Morse potential is needed. G. N. Lewis devised a “cubic-octet” theory based on the newly discovered electron, and developed it into a shared pair model to explain bonding. After discussing Lewis-dot notation and formal charge, Professor McBride shows that in some “single-minimum” cases the Lewis formalism is inadequate and salvaging it required introducing the confusing concept of “resonance.”Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","So last time we got to the point of asking the question, are there atoms and molecules — and well, I anticipate that the answer is yes — and what force holds the atoms together? However, if you put the earth in the way, there’d be a shadow, and now you’d have more things hitting the moon from the right than from the left. And this attraction between the particles or repulsion) “For it’s well known that Bodies act upon one another by the Attractions of Gravity, Magnetism and Electricity; and these Instances shew the Tenor and Course of Nature, and make it not improbable but that there may be more attractive Powers than these. I use that Word here to signify only in general any Force by which Bodies tend toward one another, whatsoever be the Cause. And there may be others which reach to so small distances as hitherto to escape observation; and perhaps electrical Attraction may reach to such small distances, even without being excited by Friction.” ( First there’s Coulomb’s law; so it charges over the distance. And now there is no balanced minimum in the middle. And if we pull it further, it pops and it becomes a double minimum. And if we keep going the double minimum gets more pronounced. How can you look at those curves and tell how far apart you have to stretch it before the chain pops? So there are different numbers of these lines, valences, for different atoms. Hydrogen has one; carbon has four; oxygen two; nitrogen three. What the loop means, if you look at it in the context, is what makes NHreactive? This thing didn’t explain anything, or explained everything. He doesn’t say  octets should be so great, but if they’re octets then you could explain bonds. So what was an octet, what was a cube, becomes what? And we can abbreviate it this way, and leave the dot. Well we’ll get later on to know about what a surface potential is. Or what else can happen, with a sulfur, what additionally can happen? So there are problems to drill on Lewis structures. And it’s also possible to make a ring of CNO and put the hydrogen on any of the positions. Like the same molecule but different structure. It’s the same molecule but a different structure. But in the top one, nitrogen is much closer to carbon than to oxygen. So that if you draw a picture of the energy, as a function of the position of the nitrogen, you could get two different structures, one where it’s further to the left, where the nitrogen is further to the left you have this structure, and when the nitrogen’s in the middle you have that structure. It’s that the notation you use doesn’t show the right structure, and when that happens there’s said to be “resonance”; although actually all it is is that the true structure is a single minimum, not the double minimum you’d expect from your drawing."
124,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-30,"The chemical mode of action of omeprazole is expected to be insensitive to its stereochemistry, making clinical trials of the proposed virtues of a chiral switch crucial. Design of the clinical trials is discussed in the context of marketing. Otolaryngologist Dr. Dianne Duffey provides a clinician’s perspective on the testing and marketing of pharmaceuticals, on the FDA approval process, on clinical trial system, on off-label uses, and on individual and institutional responsibility for evaluating pharmaceuticals.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","So remember we were talking about configuration, about handedness, which was introduced - the idea was introduced - in the context of a tetrahedral carbon. So lose the proton on the nitrogen and then have those electrons re-form the double bond to carbon, and the electrons go out on sulfur, and you get this thing. What will make the drug, in this form, reactive? And, in fact, this is an interesting problem in the design of the drug, because it’s acid that causes this to happen, in two minutes, to become the active form. Okay, now should a chiral switch, to a single enantiomer — omeprazole, Prilosec, is a racemate, it’s a 50:50 mixture of the enantiomers; enantiomers, remember, at sulfur, not at carbon. All that that mechanism I showed you did was to change that bond from there to there, and the proton from nitrogen to sulfur. The bond is going — like it can either go inside or outside. Still, it could be that one enantiomer is better at getting through the digestive system and getting back to the stomach, in order to do the trick. And here’s data from Wellmark, which is the Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Iowa and South Dakota; so a pretty small population area. And this is how many prescriptions they wrote for Prilosec in the period from 1999 to 2003; just went up by 250% to a quarter of a million. Okay, but now these proton pump inhibitors come along. To show the best distinction between the new stuff and the old stuff. And Professor McBride did give me permission today to talk a little bit about his case. And these are all things that I need to be taking into account when I prescribe a drug to a patient. Is that patient population representative of my patient population? And I submit — and I think Professor McBride, who helped write some of these slides, probably also feels — that there is some duty on the part, not only of the manufacturers, but of academic institutions, who are also running their own clinical trials, to actually design the studies so that it’s easy to understand; the data are there and they’re very clear, so that they can make also very legitimate head-to-head marketing comparisons between competitor compounds. As a physician, I feel that I have a duty to really evaluate the literature critically. We can follow this clinically, and that’s usually what we do. The preliminary data generated generally is for effectiveness of the compound for a particular disease or a condition. So this is where we start to get into specifics about which dose of omeprazole am I going to choose if I’m going to compare this to esomeprazole? It’s really quite remarkable to watch, as a clinician. So these companies are very, very invested. I’m only showing you a few studies, just to demonstrate what type of data I have to actually take into consideration, as a clinician, when I’m looking critically at how the studies were done; whether I think the drug’s actually going to be helpful for my patient or not. So then finally these are some of the three studies that Professor McBride has already alluded to, showing that there are variable results. And this is where we get into off-label use of drugs. So oncology drugs; immunology, which would be something for rheumatoid arthritis, for example; and neurology are going to be a very, very big focus of attention of pharma industry. So she’s noted when these ads come on TV that there’s a very long disclaimer afterwards about the side-effects. I was involved with one clinical trial where a phase IV study actually was mandated. So I think for the pharma companies — correct me if I’m wrong; you may have more insights — it’s probably, it’s a decision that they have to weigh. You can market anything you want, for almost any indication, and whatever dose goes. So the question is if an off-label use for a drug can’t be advertised by the company, how do I as a physician hear about it? But I look for literature within my field. And there actually are phase III trials going on right now by a colleague of mine down in Manhattan, looking at exactly that question. But I don’t know of any specific negative side-effects that were used."
125,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-31,"After mentioning some legal implications of chirality, the discussion of configuration concludes using esomeprazole as an example of three general methods for producing single enantiomers. Conformational isomerism is more subtle because isomers differ only by rotation about single bonds, which requires careful physico-chemical consideration of energies and their relation to equilibrium and rate constants. Conformations have their own notation and nomenclature. Curiously, the barrier to rotation about the C-C bond of ethane was established by measuring its heat capacity.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Last time we heard about some medical considerations regarding stereochemistry, and we’re going to just start today with a little bit about legal considerations about stereochemistry. First, resolution of omeprazole by chromatography. So they found out that the half-life for racemization was an hour at 75°, which they then extrapolated to what it would be at a body temperature to be 100 hours; so plenty of time. So you have that as the pure  enantiomer. So you can lose another RO- and you get this Ti+. But now you have a different functional group there. So you get the sulfur attached to the oxygen, and it’s S+, since it has used its electrons to make that new bond. And that’s the sulfoxide; remember, that’s the important group in the ()-omeprazole; that’s what sets things going. But the chiral oxidizing agent means that it will discriminate between the two hands of the product. And one thing they did was to add diisopropylethylamine. You get rid of the 3%, and you have the stuff you want. Note that constitution is already involving the bonding model. And, in general, it’s hard to break bonds and easier to rotate bonds. So not all the different phases of vibration are considered different molecules; that would be way too much, to call those all isomers of one another. But it was only in 1950 that conformational analysis began, and then twenty-five years later that people started doing significant, what’s called molecular mechanics modeling, treating molecules as if they were springs and so on. We talk much more about why things work — how bonding works, how to recognize a functional group — than we do with memorizing reactions that will get you from here to there. Now, in the late nineteenth century, when these guys were founding physical chemistry, organic chemists focused their efforts on molecular structure, on these things having to do with configuration and enantiomers and so on. So you can call energy , or if you’re more particular you can call it , for enthalpy, or  for Gibbs free energy; and entropy gets into the argument, as we’ll see in a few lectures. It’ll be 1000; 10; 3/4 of 4 is 3; 10 is 1000. So forget spontaneously, at room temperature, going over a barrier of 40 kcal/mole, for practical purposes. Or this one, remember, that Fischer used; which is good because you can bend it, for his purposes, for drawing two-dimensional Fischer projections. But you can also have them be right on top of one another, like this. Okay?Now that’s not so convenient, because you can’t see the stuff in back. How about gauche, is it chiral; is there a mirror here? And, what’s the energy minimum?Now let’s just suppose, together with van’t Hoff and Paternó and the person who made the Molecule of the Week, that the lowest energy — if we plot energy versus phase of rotation here — that the lowest energy is 0°; that’s fully eclipsed, like this. all the way up to whatever temperature you’re interested in. So don’t worry about it, except by this definition for now. So both those factors mean that the entropy, at any given temperature, is going to be smaller, because you’ve absorbed less stuff in the numerator, and you’ve absorbed it at a higher temperature; so you have a bigger denominator for all these contributions. And the same for the third to the second, or the fourth to the third."
126,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-32,"Why ethane has a rotational barrier is still debatable. Analyzing conformational and configurational stereotopicity relationships among constitutionally equivalent groups reveals a subtle discrimination in enzyme reactions. When Baeyer suggested strain-induced reactivity due to distorting bond angles away from those in an ideal tetrahedron, he assumed that the cyclohexane ring is flat. He was soon corrected by clever Sachse, but Sachse’s weakness in rhetoric led to a quarter-century of confusion.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Okay, so we were talking last time about rotation in ethane, and the fact that there was a barrier, and that you can measure the barrier. And one way to measure the barrier, the first way that the barrier was measured, was remarkably enough, by the heat capacity of ethane; how much heat it takes to warm it to a certain temperature. All these various abbreviations are various really high-quality computational results. And then all these calculations give about 2.7 kcal/mole. But that’s not easy to do in your head, because there are also attractions between a proton on one side, and the electron on the other, and it’s not clear which of these is going to dominate. So you’ll get better HOMO/LUMO interaction from one side to the other; and not only for these two hydrogens, but for the other two pairs of hydrogens as well, if the thing is staggered, so that the opposite ones are parallel to one another. The name “hyperconjugation” was created to talk about the same phenomenon when it’s  bonds, rather than  bonds that are doing the trick; and it’s usually much, much less important. We’ll talk about more examples of this later on. But at any rate, that’s a very different point of view from the first one. That doesn’t happen over on the other case because it’s so hard to get the proton off, and the carbon has no unshared pair to pick up the new proton. First, we said that the blue ones were homotopic. Are their environments superimposable, exactly on one another? Obviously that was sort of a leading question. Now, so these distinctions are only conformational and erased by rotation; in 10 seconds I said here. What would happen if you tried to rotate, to put the back green one in the place of the front green one? But the important thing is you have to break a bond to change them. You guys shouldn’t sit next to each other. But which one should be third and which one should be fourth? So they’ll have precisely the same rates. You can pull it off and check optical activity. So if you do a full cycle, like that, then you come back — pardon me — you come back exactly where you started. And this picture hangs in the hallway out there, the original picture. But that doesn’t — so he used that to say where the methyl groups were on the ring. The four valences are equivalent, shown by the fact there’s only one monosubstitution product of methane.” ( And people didn’t understand what it was. And he gave people this thing so they could make their own models and see it. ”That this, only one cyclohexane carboxylic acid. And here he gives more formulas; again, things that didn’t appeal at all to anybody who was actually interested in the arrangement of atoms in space."
127,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-33,"Understanding conformational relationships makes it easy to draw idealized chair structures for cyclohexane and to visualize axial-equatorial interconversion. After quantitative consideration of the conformational energies of ethane, propane, and butane, cyclohexane is used to illustrate the utility of molecular mechanics as an alternative to quantum mechanics for estimating such energies. To give useful accuracy this empirical scheme requires thousands of arbitrary parameters. Unlike quantum mechanics, it assigns strain to specific sources such as bond stretching, bending, and twisting, and van der Waals repulsion or attraction.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Okay, so as you remember, before we ended, we were talking about Sachse and how he explained everything in more detail than people wanted to hear about. Scientists are probably sort of geeks, actually; but that’s okay. But the boat is what Sachse made his picture of, and it’s easy to think about. Okay, now you should learn how to draw chair cyclohexanes. Now that means when you draw the frame it looks like this, so that opposite ones are parallel to one another. Okay, so six of the hydrogen bonds are parallel to the axis of symmetry. So even if you drew the six-membered ring in some cockeyed direction, so that its mean plane was like this, or like this, or like this, or like this, still you can see where that axis points and make the axial bonds parallel to that axis. I’ll go one, two, three, four, five, and you raise your hand when I get the right one. But there are other chiral centers in the molecule. So this is the picture, from his paper in 1950, that Barton drew to show that ring A; and the bracket there, that I’ve drawn in, shows where it would go on to ring B. I’ve truncated his picture. No, this one, notice, is exactly horizontal, and this one is exactly horizontal. What does that mean Maria, about the axial bonds? So you don’t have to feel bad when you draw it wrong the first few times. Okay, so and you try with models if you’re skeptical. Okay now, nowadays people, much more often, encounter these things on animations. Okay, so if you go to this website, you can click there to get it. So they show here, for example, ethane, and if you click ‘Play’ — let’s see, I think I’ve got it animated here — you can step from one position to the next and see what the shape looks like. And you can click on a point and the model will turn, to show you what it’s like. So let the buyer beware in situations like that. So here’s the rotation in propane, and it says the barrier is 5 kcal/mole. How to find out how fast something is, if you know how big the barrier is you have to go across? Essentially it’s just using Hooke’s Law for the model, to calculate strain energies. And you can resolve them, and get optically active forms — one that’s twisted to the right, one that’s twisted to the left — even though you don’t have a carbon that has four different things on it; because it can’t rotate. That’s what conformation involves, after all. So that’s a threefold barrier, for rotating. And that one, you see, is 0.27 kilocalories high. It’s because it’s — the van der Waals repulsion is least when these two carbons are as far apart from one another, rather than being eclipsed with one another. Or suppose you had axial methylcyclohexane. Now you have much, much worse van der Waals interactions — right? —"
128,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-34,"Professor Barry Sharpless of Scripps describes the Nobel-prizewinning development of titanium-based catalysts for stereoselective oxidation, the mechanism of their reactions, and their use in preparing esomeprazole. Conformational energy of cyclic alkanes illustrates the use of molecular mechanics.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","So you remember this slide from several lectures ago. And then they take it away from you at birth; they cut it and they take it away. So you could have anything there; nitrogen and oxygen. or three years old; you’re pretty much locked in, unfortunately, in some ways. Nature is supposed to be very, very touchy about changing her preferences. And then when we came to titanium — we’d been working with vanadium and molybdenum. And it goes way back to Louis Pasteur, with the discovery of tetrahedral carbon; I mean then the precursor to it. I was looking at him; he was looking at me. And whatever else — if that’s going well, life is good. So I went back to MIT, which I wouldn’t have if I’d gotten this about three months earlier, probably. This is a more reactive olefin for the transfer of the oxygen, but it doesn’t have the handle. And titanium goes about ten times faster with tartrate. And this book though, is a huge book, which was gotten by Nancy Schrock, who’s in charge of the MIT Archives and is a book restorer. There’s Nexium, and maybe we’re getting — I went too far into the other stuff. And then he got Katsuki and me over to his office, and he interviewed us for about ten minutes. If we don’t make it, it won’t matter that much. We’re just going to do this straight-out attack here. So now you have to — yeah, if he was a good yoga person, he could pyramidalize it a little better. Because where are the anchor points that we need, the group that binds the metal? But the feature that’s important here is the pKa of this benzimidazole is probably — I looked it up; I think it’s below that of an alcohol. It’s more encumbered, and it’s probably — kinetics are slower for this, and off of oxygen, for the hydrogen transfers that are needed. So it can’t itself get at the oxygen; which you would worry about. And usually you could write a concerted mechanism. Like let me erase some of this and have some room here. You got this benzimidazole, with a sulfur here, and I’m going to put the hydrogen up here. Whenever you engage compounds in reaction, acid-base reactions, you look for the basic sites and the acidic sites. And that story doesn’t wash too well here. Okay, and he was going to talk about carvone too. And we talked last time a lot about cyclohexane, and how it distorted — remember, that it’s not really ideal, with the axial bonds parallel to the axis. What is it that makes the energy the way it is? This one is eclipsed, but also this one is eclipsed; those four."
129,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-35,"Although molecular mechanics is imperfect, it is useful for discussing molecular structure and energy in terms of standard covalent bonds. Analysis of the Cambridge Structural Database shows that predicting bond distances to within 1% required detailed categorization of bond types. Early attempts to predict heats of combustion in terms of composition proved adequate for physiology, but not for chemistry. Group- or bond-additivity schemes are useful for understanding heats of formation, especially when corrected for strain. Heat of atomization is the natural target for bond energy schemes, but experimental measurement requires spectroscopic determination of the heat of atomization of elements in their standard states.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","At the end last time we asked the question whether molecular mechanics programs are useful? And all these other atoms are attracting one another, pulling toward one another. And, of course, many are further because other atoms are running into one another, of these two molecules. And you see that many structures are available. It turns out that if you do ones where the nitrogen and the benzene are co-planar, as shown above, then you have one nice histogram. So the bonds are longer than the ones that are partial double bonds. You have poor  overlap when the nitrogen-carbon bond is twisted. We want to understand all stuff; chemicals that is. And the key to doing this, the trick we’re going to use, is to understand the basis of structure — how the atoms are arranged — and energy. He didn’t mean constitution to mean nature and sequence of bonds. We know you can burn carbon, coal, and get a certain amount of heat out. So you should get 303.7 out of burning a mole of ethene. Notice, we could even understand why you get a little more heat out than you expected, because one of the bonds in CH is not such a strong bond. Now let’s try to extend it to other things. How big a factor in equilibrium would nine kilocalories be? and it’s the one we’ve just been using, without saying so — which is CO and HO; the same amount of carbon in CO and the same amount of hydrogen in HO. Ah, so all you have to do is burn it, see how much heat you get out, and you know the energy relative to CO and HO. So graphite; how stable is it compared to graphite being the carbon and H gas being the hydrogen? We would get a very good prediction of what their heat of formation is if we just multiply from the value we got from cyclohexane. And you can really see this if you look at space-filling models of these. But then if you also know — if somebody out there has for you measured the heat of combustion of graphite, and the heat of combustion of hydrogen, then you have the numbers that enable you to work up your data and find out what the heat of formation of your substance was. So now this book, in Appendix III of this book, has average bond energies. So again you’re going to do these heats of combustion, but you’re going to need somebody to measure a new value for you; not just the heat of combustion of graphite and the heat of combustion of hydrogen gas. If we knew that, then we could figure out that that’s going to be  kilocalories/mol; that’s to get out six carbons from graphite and twelve hydrogens from H gas, in order to make the CH of cyclohexane. And indeed you can’t buy C in a bottle to do the experiment either. But what you can get in a bottle is CO, carbon monoxide. So all we need to have is that difference, and we know what the heat of formation of carbon is. So we’re able to do it by doing spectroscopy on CO.But this was done — people got the number 171.3, but then they began to worry. You can measure these positions of spectral lines very accurately, but you don’t know how to interpret it."
130,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-36,"After discussing the classic determination of the heat of atomization of graphite by Chupka and Inghram, the values of bond dissociation energies, and the utility of average bond energies, the lecture focuses on understanding equilibrium and rate processes through statistical mechanics. The Boltzmann factor favors minimal energy in order to provide the largest number of different arrangements of “bits” of energy. The slippery concept of disorder is illustrated using Couette flow. Entropy favors “disordered arrangements” because there are more of them than there are of recognizable ordered arrangements.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Okay, at the end last time we were looking at how you could possibly know the heat of atomization of graphite; how much energy it takes to put a carbon atom into the gas phase from graphite. But the last thing you need is the energy of graphite relative to the atom. Okay, except that people who were very smart, Nobel Prize winners and so on, differed on interpreting this, because some of them thought that when you break  into atoms, with the light, the atom you get is not the lowest energy state of the atom, but a higher energy state of the atom. So if we’re much higher than room temperature, then the exponent gets much smaller. Right?Now, of course, exactly what one means by the concentration of graphite needs to be — you scratch your head a little bit about that. But you don’t actually need to know it, because if you could measure the pressure of the C atoms at equilibrium with graphite, at very high temperature — call that the pressure of carbon, right? — But it was done in 1955 by Chupka and Inghram. But you at least have these things there at equilibrium. And that will allow a little bit of the gas to escape; not so much that you destroy the equilibrium inside, just a really slow leak. So now, if you could measure the amount of these different carbon species leaking out, you could know what the pressure of them was inside the can. Now, so you have to put shielding around this stuff, so it doesn’t melt everything. And from the slope, you can see up there at the top, that for C you get — the slope says it’s 171 kilocalories/mol; Q.E.D. Right?Now you know which was the right one, measured by spectroscopy. Now that comes from mating a carbon atom with four hydrogen atoms; that is 397.5. So about 100 kilocalories/mol for a C-H bond; that’s convenient to remember. Now the second bond is stronger than the first. And we’re going to sum them all up to get the heat of atomization — compare it with the actual heat of atomization. Or if you do glucose, which has lots of oxygens in it, then you get within again less then 1%; 0.7% of the right value. So this is pretty darn good; very impressive, very small errors, to predict these. Now so that’s — whatever — the calculated energy is whatever the true energy would be. You can’t use the average bond energies and get something that’s very useful, because if you’re off by sixteen down here, in the case of sugar, that means you’re off by a factor of 10th in predicting the equilibrium constant, which wouldn’t be acceptable probably. This is a really interesting case, and it has to do with statistics. And here’s his tombstone in the cemetery in Vienna. Now how many different ways are there of arranging it so that there are two in the first container? Now disorder, reversibility and Couette flow. So if you want to see that, come after class and we’ll try the actual experiment. Okay, so it’s a glass rod that goes up inside a glass cylinder. So the rotated state only  to be disordered. But in fact that’s not true, because you divide by  to get anything out of it again."
131,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-37,"After discussing the statistical basis of the law of mass action, the lecture turns to developing a framework for understanding reaction rates. A potential energy surface that associates energy with polyatomic geometry can be realized physically for a linear, triatomic system, but it is more practical to use collective energies for starting material, transition state, and product, together with Eyring theory, to predict rates. Free-radical chain halogenation provides examples of predicting reaction equilibria and rates from bond dissociation energies. The lecture concludes with a summary of the semester’s topics from the perspective of physical-organic chemistry.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Okay, so last time we were talking about exponents, and how statistics gives rise to them. Then there’s the entropy factor, which we saw last time. And by the middle 1800s, this was formulated as an equilibrium constant, , which was understood as the balance between forward reactions and reverse reactions. So there’s — if you have 50 particles, this particular realization of randomness gave one dimer. We have energy distribution, , the Boltzmann factor. Okay, so free energy determines what equilibrium is, what can happen. And we’re going to look at two kinds of things. So two coordinates will tell you what the arrangement of those three atoms are, if they’re in just one dimension. Okay, so a linear triatomic, A-B-C. On the horizontal distance we have the distance A to B, on the vertical axis, B to C, and the contours tell us how low the energy is; the darker, the lower the energy. Yeah, the atoms are all separate from one another. So as it comes along, B and C are standing still. And then it starts — AB is vibrating, and C is getting far away, as it goes down the product valley. Now people have made surfaces like that for real systems, like H, one hydrogen atom attacking a hydrogen molecule and taking one of the hydrogens away. There actually is a potato chip, not a lake up there at the pass. So here it is, and the dimensions, that one inch corresponds to 1.4 inches is an angstrom, and so on. And that would allow me to predict the rate of this process. Okay, so people have done that kind of thing. But we can now use free energy to determine what can happen. Multiply it by 10, and you know how fast it’s going. So it’s not really a rigorous theory, but it’s a very, very helpful theory for approximate purposes. Then you do single electron curved arrows; take the hydrogen away from methyl — from methane, to give methyl, and then it attacks chlorine — we’ve seen this before — and the chlorine atom comes back to constitute a chain reaction. So H 104.2; HF 136; HCl 103; HBr 87; HI 71. But at any rate, the normal, the starting bond, is normal. So it’s easy to break that one; 10 kilocalories easier than for normal C-H bonds. And the cost is the sum of those two; what it’s going to cost to break those bonds. How fast would the reaction be, if we used that mechanism? You’re paying 105 but you’re getting back 136. The first step seems plausible now; although you don’t know how high the barrier is that you have to get from starting material to product. So you should be in a position to think about this now. But suppose chemistry was developing in some other solar system."
132,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-3,"Continuing the discussion of Lewis structures and chemical forces from the previous lecture, Professor McBride introduces the double-well potential of the ozone molecule and its structural equilibrium. The inability for inverse-square force laws to account for stable arrangements of charged particles is prescribed by Earnshaw’s Theorem, which may be visualized by means of lines of force. J.J. Thomson circumvented Earnshaw’s prohibition on structure by postulating a “plum-pudding” atom. When Rutherford showed that the nucleus was a point, Thomson had to conclude that Coulomb’s law was invalid at small distances.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","This is the slide from the end of last time, we didn’t quite finish it. But these are not rules like the rules you want to learn in physics. Okay, so the goal of this Lewis stuff was from the number of valence electrons it would be nice to be able to predict the constitution, that is, the valence numbers for the different atoms, how many atoms of one kind or another get together to make a molecule. So the trivalent oxygen is positive, as you would expect. Well you have to do some experiment to find that out or some high-faluting calculation that you believe; a quantum mechanical calculation. Or you could give this distance and this distance and the angle here. But we’re not going to do that in class, that’s just to do on your own or with a discussion section. So any point on that thing will specify the structure. A particularly interesting position is that one, because that’s the pass, that’s the lowest you can go, the lowest energy that’s required to go from one valley to the other. It turns out it crosses every contour perpendicularly. Not that the true molecule would necessarily have to follow that path, but it’s a well-defined path that gets from one valley to the other. And there’s experimental evidence that supports that too, but it’s more complicated. That’s what we’re after, remember, here altogether. But we want to understand what that means. One thing that means is that if you have Coulombic interaction, positive/negative, you can’t have a minimum energy structure that has a nucleus here and eight electrons at the corner of a cube, because there are inverse-square force laws and that can’t be a minimum energy; if it distorted, it would keep going. Now we can visualize Earnshaw’s theorem here in terms of for electrostatics by the analogy that you’ve all seen of magnetic lines of force; everybody’s seen something like this I think, right? Okay, so that means the force, which is proportional to the line density, must be proportional to 1/r. Okay? But Thomson himself came up with what came to be called — and I don’t know by who first, I’ve tried to find out and can’t — the “plum-pudding” atom. They didn’t know that the inverse existed, so they thought that… No, none of this is it. But the big magnet attracts them to the center. So if you have just one, it goes to the center; no big deal. If you have two, you get a line; there’s no big deal about that. He wrote: “If electron nuclear attraction were to vary strictly as the inverse-square, we know by Earnshaw’s theorem that no stable configuration is possible with the electrons at rest or oscillating about positions of equilibrium… I shall assume that the law of force between a positive charge and an electron is expressed by this equation… Then a number of electrons can be in equilibrium about a positive charge without necessarily describing orbits around it.” So we’ll see what happened three years later next time."
133,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-4,"This lecture asks whether it is possible to confirm the reality of bonds by seeing or feeling them. It first describes the work of “clairvoyant” charlatans from the beginning of the twentieth century, who claimed to “see” details of atomic and molecular structure, in order to discuss proper bases for scientific belief. It then shows that the molecular scale is not inconceivably small, and that Newton and Franklin performed simple experiments that measure such small distances. In the last 25 years various realizations of Scanning Probe Microscopy have enabled chemists to “feel” individual molecules and atoms, but not bonds.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Okay, so we saw last time that Lewis wasn’t so dumb. So that would do okay then for a structure. So cubic octets of Lewis and  electrostatic force laws, like this  term in there, soon disappeared from conventional chemistry and physics; immediately in fact, I mean within a month say. But the idea of shared-pairs, and lone-pairs, that Lewis came up with, remained useful tools for discussing structure and bonding. But despite Earnshaw, might Lewis have been right? But there are more recent techniques that suggest that you can really see things that small; at least you can think about them clearly. But some people didn’t like this idea of going back and forth between two things, and they thought that you just have the fourth valence of every carbon going into the middle, all satisfying one another. But I suspect that Crookes is not so familiar to you. But he’s the guy who supplied the samples for Leadbeater and Besant to look at. And there were a lot of semi-, well really serious scientists. But to get back to the point, and forget clairvoyance for awhile, which I don’t believe in, the question is, are molecules unobservably small for what Newton called “vulgar eyes”? Okay, now think about 10.So this lecture room is about ten meters wide. So here are two pieces of glass, two disks of glass. So that’s a lot bigger than an atom; but if you go into the first ring, or even closer, then you can measure it. So all he needed was a spherical glass with a very large radius that he could measure his distances from. The learned, too, are apt to slight too much the knowledge of the vulgar. “At length being at Clapham, where there is on the common a large pond which I observed one day to be very rough with the wind, I fetched out a cruet of oil and dropped a little of it on the water. And you have a very precise position detector for the laser light up where you see the light glowing. So the width of the tip is like 100 or so atoms. So it’s touching a bunch of atoms at any one time. It always stays the same size as the others dissolve. So what you do is you have something on the surface of a slide here that you want to probe with this, and you send light down the thing, and if there is a molecule where the light’s coming out, through this tiny hole, if there’s a molecule there, that will take the blue light and emit red light. Now, that’s — I’m going to spend the last few minutes going over the problem that we were looking at with — remember you were supposed to draw all the resonance structures for H, C, O, N isomers. So that’s — not only is there a charge separation, it’s in the wrong direction. Curved arrows show a shift of electrons, an electron pair. And no one succeeded; in fact, only a few people get the — know which the lowest one is, on the basis of their familiarity with Lewis theory. Actually, there’s a reference for this if you want to see it."
134,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-5,Professor McBride introduces the theory behind light diffraction by charged particles and its application to the study of the electron distribution in molecules by x-ray diffraction. The roles of molecular pattern and crystal lattice repetition are illustrated by shining laser light through diffraction masks to generate patterns reminiscent of those encountered in X-ray studies of ordered solids.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008),"So as we ended last time, we said despite Earnshaw, which says you can’t have these Lewis structures, might there really  shared-pair bonds and lone-pairs, and how do we know; we have to look, or feel. Now suppose that happened to be one wavelength. But if the wavelength difference were half — if the path difference were half the wavelength, like for red light —Oh-oh. And then from that information, those scattered rays, you get where the atoms are in the molecule; more precisely, as you’ll see, where the electrons are in the molecule, or in the crystal. So light is associated with an electric field that goes up and down. And you can plot it in time or in space and get a wave. Now, its effect is on charges; on electrons, on protons, therefore on nuclei. There’s one benzene molecule missing there. All the bones do is stop the x-rays that are going through. So you don’t get something that’s enlarged. So the closer things are together, the fewer the angles are. Closer together, further apart, in what’s called ‘reciprocal space. So you don’t even notice the difference, from that. Okay, so this blue line here is called the scattering vector, and that’s how different the arrow coming out is from the arrow going in. Okay, so there’s the scattering vector, perpendicular to these planes, and all the electrons on any one plane will scatter in-phase with one another. It’ll be as if it were all the electrons working together. So the net in-phase scattering is as if there were ten electrons doing the scattering. There’s a pattern being repeated, pairs of lines. So it’s oriented benzene; that’s the next one we’re going to look at. Now then he’s going to show you this one. So how does it look different from what we saw before? They’re not just evenly — they’re not just all the same or slowly dying away as you move out to right or left. So it’s like looking at the scattering from a single molecule but looking at it through a pegboard. And there are dots along the arms of the X. Okay? And when we had a lattice made of those, you saw the same underlying pattern, but only at little — only at regularly spaced spots that had to do with how far apart the hexagons were from one another, and much more intense, because all the light that would be scattered all over the screen here is focused in those little dots. Okay, now can you see what we need in order to understand?"
135,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-6,"Professor McBride uses a hexagonal “benzene” pattern and Franklin’s X-ray pattern of DNA, to continue his discussion of X-ray crystallography by explaining how a diffraction pattern in “reciprocal space” relates to the distribution of electrons in molecules and to the repetition of molecules in a crystal lattice. He then uses electron difference density mapping to reveal bonds, and unshared electron pairs, and their shape, and to show that they are only one-twentieth as dense as would be expected for Lewis shared pairs. Anomalous difference density in the carbon-fluorine bond raises the course’s second great question, “Compared to what?”Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","So we want to understand diffraction patterns. So what we’re going to do now is look just a little bit — — no one figures this out, in a real case; people have written fancy computer programs to do this. Notice, they don’t have to fall exactly on, because if they’re displaced a little bit, the phase of the wave will change a little bit, compared to the others; but only a little bit. Far out, and there you see it, way out at the edge. Okay, so there again we notice here that the closer spaced planes give higher angles. And that’s what we saw when we went to this final picture for scattering from a lattice. So what this means is that the lattice repeat concentrates the snowflake scattering into tightly focused spots, on a regular pattern. So the crystal is the real thing that you’re interested in, and diffraction photo is in diffraction space; you see these dots that Lowy Laue saw, for example, for copper sulfate. Okay, now let’s look at the light bulb filament, the last thing we looked at, and see why the scattering from that looks the way we do — — looks like this X with dots along it. But you could make planes that are twice as close to one another. Not — well it probably will be not as bright, and the reason is that for — there are two things that have to do with the brightness. But as the planes get closer and closer, the fact that the wire has a finite thickness means that some parts of the wire, the same part of the wire, are out-of-phase compared to others. Okay, now what does the X, the angle of the X tell you? So it tells the scale of the helix, right? Instead of being strong, not quite as strong, less strong, weaker, very weak, as you go out, it goes weak, strong, strong, very weak, strong. Can you say it in a more mathematical way? What happens now?You’re missing even numbers. Now tell me what happens if I add that other one offset this way. So it was possible to slice through practically all the nuclei. So you have these pieces of paper that say how much the electron density would be at all different points; experimentally, how much it is experimentally. This was done by Leiserowitz and Ziva Berkovitch-Yellin thirty-three years ago. If we slice the first one, and turn it, it’s oval for the same reason as before; there’s a p orbital pointing in and out of the board, and if we look at it below, part of the bond is caused by overlapping, as we’ll see, of those  orbitals. There must be something different about the interaction at the end and the interaction in the middle. And there is the electron difference density. Okay, so there’s a carbon-carbon aromatic bond, a bond and a half, and if you turn it and look at it, it’s distorted the way you expect, just as in the previous experiment we talked about. What’s it going to look like in cross-section?"
136,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-7,"After pointing out several discrepancies between electron difference density results and Lewis bonding theory, the course proceeds to quantum mechanics in search of a fundamental understanding of chemical bonding. The wave function ψ, which beginning students find confusing, was equally confusing to the physicists who created quantum mechanics. The Schrödinger equation reckons kinetic energy through the shape of ψ. When ψ curves toward zero, kinetic energy is positive; but when it curves away, kinetic energy is negative!Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Okay, so we just glimpsed this at the end last time. So you could cut a slice that went through all the atoms. And here is the difference electron density. Okay, so again that’s nothing surprising. Here we’re looking at a plane that contains the bond, and again there’s no there there. I think you got the idea but I’m not sure everybody understood it. But of course if they’re sort of close to one another, that doesn’t surprise you too much because as you go out and out and out, ultimately you’ll get rings that do meet, if you go far enough down. Okay, so it came with the Schrödinger wave equation that was discovered in, or invented perhaps we should say, in — I don’t know whether — it’s hard to know whether to say discovered or invented; I think invented is probably better — in 1926. Now, the potential energy part is in fact easy because it’s given to you. Now if you know the charges of the particles, and their positions, and know Couloumb’s Law, then you know the potential energy, if Couloumb’s Law is right. Or here it is, written just a little differently. So what would happen to the kinetic energy there if we doubled the size of  every place? When you’re given the charge, and you know Couloumb’s Law, then you know how to calculate the potential energy; remember that’s part of it. But that function has to be such that  is the total energy, and the total energy is the same, no matter where the particle is, right, because the potential energy and the kinetic energy cancel out. And  has to be integrable; you have to be able to tell how much area is under , and you’ll see why shortly. And notice that the kinetic energy is proportional to one over the wavelength squared, right?; ; You can have kinetic energy that’s less than zero. Then you have this situation in any real atom. It looks like a saddle point so it’s probably zero. So it’s got zero curvature there; okay, zero curvature. Okay, so how about the curvature; curving up, curving down? Which way is it curving at this point here? At these places, the potential energy is higher than the total energy. If the potential energy is a continuous kind of thing, then, although we couldn’t tell by looking at the wave function, it’s curving away from the baseline, but very slightly, right?"
137,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-8,"Professor McBride expands on the recently introduced concept of the wave function by illustrating the relationship of the magnitude of the curvature of the wave function to the kinetic energy of the system, as well as the relationship of the square of the wave function to the electron probability density. The requirement that the wave function not diverge in areas of negative kinetic energy leads to only certain energies being allowed, a property which is explored for the harmonic oscillator, Morse potential, and the Columbic potential. Consideration of the influence of mass reveals an “isotope effect” on dynamics, on the energy, vibration frequency, and length of bonds.Professor McBride’s web resources for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Okay, so last time we saw the jeopardy approach to solving the Schrödinger equation, which is to take the answer and find out what the problem was, and we saw that for a constant potential you got a sine wave. And you can do that by guessing the energy. And if you recalculate and know the curvature at that point, then you know what the curvature at the next point is going to be, and the next and the next and the next, and you can use this to just draw a curve that’s bound to satisfy the Schrödinger equation because you’re using the Schrödinger equation to generate it. Do you want me to say it again, or you got it now? Okay, so that’s great, and it would be tedious to do this by hand, but that’s what this little program, , does is start the curve and draw it out, according to what — if you know everything else in the equation. So the potential energy being greater than the total energy is a bad situation intuitively, right, it means the kinetic energy is negative, and it curves away from the baseline. The kinetic energy is going to be positive, right? Now, there’s a problem, because if you go the other way, the rest of the graph, the kinetic energy is negative because the potential’s higher than the total. This thing is, the particle, if it has this total energy, is bounded, it can’t go all the way to the left or the right, that’s true enough. And all we have to do is connect the pieces. So it’ll be closer to the red than to the blue. But you’re right, that also does the trick, but it turns out to be the same thing. You know the curvature — remember, it’s a sum of a bunch of curvatures, and knowing the kinetic energy, the difference between total and potential, doesn’t tell you which curvature to change. But does  really mean something, besides just being a handy tool for this purpose? And it was later, six months later, in 1926, that it was suggested what the meaning of it was. And you’re going to ask the question, if the total mask in the flask is one kilogram, what fraction of that, or how much weight, is exactly one centimeter from the bottom? You have to multiply density, grams per cubic centimeter by volume, how many cubic centimeters, in order to get mass. But notice if you get to the seventh wavefunction; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven; the seventh wavefunction is going to have seven humps — that then it’s most probable at the extremes, and as it gets — as you get higher and higher it gets more and more focused at the extremes, and that’s why when you get to something that’s really heavy it behaves the way you expect a pendulum or a thing on a spring to behave. But notice something else that’s really valuable here, really crucial, which is that this line is where the potential and the total are the same for the red curve. So the thing exists in a region of negative kinetic energy. No, because the potential looks that way, pretty much. When do you expect the wavefunction to be an exponential decay, under what condition?When the potential energy — Can’t hear very well. Ah, when the potential energy is constant, and what else to be exponential? The reason it’s complicated is the energy goes to infinity when  becomes zero; when the positive and the negative are on top of one another it becomes infinitely favorable. But it spreads out much more because the well spreads out so much. So here’s — suppose this is a proton attached by a bond to something that’s heavy. But we can talk about how wide it is by saying how wide it is at half-height. And that’s how much it is, that little yellow dot after it shrank."
138,chemistry,chem-125a,lecture-9,"After showing how a double-minimum potential generates one-dimensional bonding, Professor McBride moves on to multi-dimensional wave functions. Solving Schrödinger’s three-dimensional differential equation might have been daunting, but it was not, because the necessary formulas had been worked out more than a century earlier in connection with acoustics. Acoustical “Chladni” figures show how nodal patterns relate to frequencies. The analogy is pursued by studying the form of wave functions for “hydrogen-like” one-electron atoms. Removing normalizing constants from the formulas for familiar orbitals reveals the underlying simplicity of their shapes.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125 (Fall 2008)","Okay, so we have the promise of the knowledge of everything, at least everything within a certain category, and we saw how we could see quantized energy last time, and structure, and structure-related dynamics, how nuclei vibrate and how it’s different for heavier atoms. Now what would happen if we moved the wells further apart? Here you see the separation of the two wells as 0.6 angstroms. And we get a higher energy for the next higher one. The particle is more stable when the wells are closer together. It turns out that the time to get from one well to the other, which I won’t be able to prove to you because it requires time-dependent quantum mechanics, and we’re talking about time-independent quantum mechanics, but let me just tell you that the answer is, if you know the energy difference between the blue and the red, that the rate of getting across is 5*10 seconds, divided by whatever that energy is, expressed in kilocalories/mole. We even can handle multiple minima and understand tunneling and so on. On top you see color coded as to whether the plane, at an instant of vibration, whether it’s toward you or away from you, as it’s vibrating; that’s the pattern. The dotted patterns and the circles and the line don’t move as the rest of the thing deforms. These mathematicians could work in three dimensions as well as two. Schrödinger didn’t find these, he just looked them up. It relates to the position of an electron, shown on the right there, relative to the nucleus. But the nucleus can have any charge you want it to. First, every one of them has  to the 3/2 power. Why do you have these constants in there? And notice, every one of these has  on it. I have the squared function here, ; remember that the wavefunction was ; the density is .To get the same thing I’m going to have to multiply that by six. How would it differ if instead of talking about the  orbital of carbon, I was talking about the  orbital of carbon? And the dependence on  is as easy as pie, it’s just (or  — it depends on what units you measure  in). So inside it’s one sign, outside it’s the opposite sign. Or I could make a picture like that, which is a contour plot showing how big it is, on a slice, through the nucleus. So it’s  times  times ; that multiplied by a constant is the wavefunction. And, notice it doesn’t depend on , the angle of rotation around here. And if we put the constants in, we could find the true probability density anywhere; just plug in , plug in , and square it, multiply it by the constant. Now, or you could have a computer do it for you, and that’s where we’re indebted to Dean Dauger, who’s a physicist."
139,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-10,"Bridged pentavalent carbon structures can be intermediates or transition states of cation rearrangement during S1 reactions, and short-lived ion pairs explain net stereochemical inversion. The different perspectives of preparative organic chemists and mechanistic organic chemists on reaction yields are illustrated by a study designed to demonstrate that molecular rotation can be rate-limiting in viscous solvents. “Electrophilic” addition to alkenes is the reverse of E2 or E1 reaction, and its mechanisms can be studied by analogous techniques. The NIST Webbook provides thermochemical data to help understand the relative stability of isomeric alkenes.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","OK, so we’re going to finish up on nucleophilic substitution, elimination reactions today with an example of practical application of them. But you could imagine that since primary cations are rather unstable, and we’ll give some more evidence on this later on, that you could get a rearrangement in which first, the HOMO next door is shared with the LUMO of the carbon cation. But at any rate, once you have the carbons rearranged like that, it’s a simple matter to have–and notice what that means is, that the [gr[s of the carbon-carbon σ-bond is actually acting as a nucleophile a displacement reaction. And if you take those three simultaneously into account, it says you can have positive charge either on the right carbon, on the hydrogen, or on the left carbon. So that hyperconjugation is one reason that more substituted cations are more stable. But in fact, in this calculation, it’s a double minimum. So now it turns out to be a single minimum, that’s the lowest energy structure. And again, you can see the HOMO, which is a  orbital on the carbon overlapping with π, and the LUMO, which I put in only because I’ve been drawing these things, but I wouldn’t spend a lot of time worrying about that one. We talked about this last semester in XH. So it depends on the polarity of the solvent. OK, now this was a question I asked on an exam once. “ Give an example of the influence of a change in reactant structure on the ratio of S2 to E2 products. If you get substitution, it’s S1 in the cases we saw last time and looking at the rates of the various RBr’s. Now there are two different organic chemical perspectives on situations where you have drastic ratios. So a synthetic chemist wants a reaction that gives a really, really high yield. There’s a delicate balance between going this way and going this way. And finally in our discussion of S2 and E2 eliminations, I’m going to give you a valuable lesson that was learned, he taught himself, by Jo-David Fine, who as you see here was the class of 1972 at Yale College, and was doing undergraduate research during the spring of 1971, so 40 years ago he began this project. And if the medium is sufficiently viscous, and the reaction that follows when they get close together is sufficiently fast, then it could be that the rate-limiting step would be motion, not breaking or making bonds. Well if it’s the hydrogen transfer, then we know that there’ll be a kinetic isotope effect, and you’ll transfer hydrogen more often than deuterium. Whether the deuterium is in the alkane product or the alkene product. So all he had to do then was to prepare this compound. So that reacting with water gave from this half a ketone, a ketone that I think some of you have seen, and on the right, the -butyl hydrazine, the compound you want. So he feels that this was very good training for him. You could attack the opposite face if it was stepwise and it rotated. So all these are questions we’re now going to address. So if you click on that, you get that those things came from Prosen, Maron and Rossini. Now this Rossini is not the guy who wrote . The one I’m looking for–here’s going to the -2-butene."
140,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-11,"Substitution stabilizes alkenes, and addition of acids is thermodynamically favorable in acidic media.  Addition to alkenes can involve free-radical, metal-catalyzed, and stepwise electrophilic mechanisms, the last  a cation intermediate. Electrostatics can help position an attacking electrophile like H, but bonding  to Markovnikov addition requires orbital mixing to form the more stable cation.  Relative cation stability can be understood in terms of hyperconjugation, hybridization, and solvation or polarizability. Stabilization of a carbocation  methide shift can compete with its trapping by solvent.  The curious relative rates in stepwise addition of HCl or HBr to alkynes show that halogen substituents are both electron withdrawing and electron donating.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","So the second part of the last lecture introduced the idea of alkenes, and we were talking about the stability of alkenes,  versus , and the effect of substitution. And that doesn’t surprise you, because we’ve talked about having more carbons as opposed to hydrogens on a double-bonded carbon makes the compound more stable. Less repulsion from the–in  there’s repulsion from the hydrogens that are on the same side. Once you’ve corrected for strain, what do you notice? But at any rate, we have the question of the addition of the mechanism. So if you had two methyl groups already on one of the double-bonded carbons, it would be the one that gets the bromine, that the hydrogen goes to the other one. Suppose you had H to react with, with the carbon-carbon double bond, a very exothermic reaction. And we’ll be talking about that pretty soon. You see it in the Jones book; it’s in chapter 10.So that would be a concerted reaction, where you make and break bonds at the same time. But it’s also possible to do it stepwise. And when it’s there, it can overlap with this π orbital. And there’ll be discussion of hydration, where instead of the X being the thing that adds to the H, [correction: C] it’s the solvent water, the unshared pair on oxygen can attack the cation as well, and then lose a proton, so that it’s OH that goes on instead X. So you can be reading that in your texts. And this, just to show an example, is from the lecture that I mentioned was given by Professor Siegel last year, where he talks about how you can do this Markovnikov addition, chloride going to the more substituted, OH going to the more substituted, Br going to the more substituted, when it’s clean, that is when you don’t have free radical initiators there. And in this case, with dilute sulfuric acid, it was water that came on to do this. Where those electrons are in the product. And if you want to be thinking really clearly about it, you should draw those arrows clearly. So the reactions, where you protonate the alkene, should be easier. And the secondary vinyl cation is also pretty high. And that really does show that secondary is more stable than primary. In the case of the cation, we have just a vacant  orbital. So there indeed would be less overlap in the case of the carbon-carbon double bond, rather than just a full-fledged  orbital. You have to be really close to get a lot of advantage out of that. Here you have that one much further away. So we can see that there’s going to be “intramolecular solvation,” you might call it, but nobody else calls it that. Is it unusually fast or unusually slow compared to what you expected? Because of the chlorine, it could be hard to get a cation. The question is how hard is it going to be to form this cation, which we did by putting a proton on that carbon. How about the regiochemistry of the second step? That is, is it Markovnikov or anti-Markovnikov? But if you form it, form it next to the bromine."
141,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-12,"When electrophilic addition involves a localized carbocation intermediate, skeletal rearrangement sometimes occurs, but it can be avoided when both alkene carbons are involved in an unsymmetrical 3-center-2-electron bond, as in Markovnikov hydration  alkoxymercuration followed by reduction. Similarly a reagent that attacks both alkene carbons simultaneously by providing a nucleophilic component during electrophilic attack can avoid rearrangement, as in reactions that proceed  three-membered-ring halonium intermediates. Simultaneity in making two bonds during formation of cyclopropanes from carbenes can be demonstrated using stereochemistry. Anti-Markovnikov hydration can be achieved  hydroboration followed by oxidation with hydroperoxide. Rearrangement of the borane hydroperoxide intermediate with frontside C-O bond formation shows close orbital analogy to backside attack during S2 substitution. Again syn-addition shows that nucleophilic attack occurs simultaneously with electrophilic attack on the alkene.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","So what is it that does the attacking in S1 and S2 reactions? To show how you do this, it requires several steps. OK, now last time, we talked about rearrangement. So the oxymercuration adds Hg and OH to the double bond. We can have the three resonance structures on the right, with Hg on the left with the primary C, and on the far left, with the secondary C. But that secondary cation would be thought to be more stable than the primary one. So when the nucleophile comes in, in the second stage of the reaction when the water comes in, it attacks that cation, not the other one. So let’s contemplate this reaction in a little more detail. At the same time that the  orbital of the chlorine is stabilizing the  electrons. And then if the bromine comes in, backside at the carbon to do its S2 reaction, you get the product that’s just like the one we’ve showed before with chlorine, except it’s two bromines that have added in this case. The positive charge is bigger on the left, so that’s where the bromide attacks. So whether it’s the OH, and you’re forming the halohydrin, or whether it’s Br, and you attack to form the dibromide, in either case, it has to be a  product. The bromine and the nucleophile have to be on opposite sides of the ring. Hydroxide, smaller, better overlap with hydrogen, is a good base. So it’s the thing that would be doing the S2 kind of reaction. And chloroform is uniquely set up to do that. So this is actually the three frames through the transition state. OK, now how would we know that both bonds form at once? Chris, you have any idea of how you can tell if two bonds are being formed at once? So if this is  and it doesn’t rotate, this product will be . That’s what we added, HOH to a double bond. Oxymercuration and reduction, which we just talked about, also forms the alcohol. So this nucleophile is attacking  at the same time. But the reason is that I’ve distorted it, to be in the shape it would have at the transition state, not where it started. Here’s the HOMO,  is the LUMO.Now, here’s the geometry of the transition state. And in fact, if we go to the transition state, you see the thing bouncing back and forth to the transition state, but if we look at the orbitals of the transition state, this is the HOMO for S2, this is the HOMO for this rearrangement. So it goes to the more substituted center. So whereas Markovnikov, of course, knew nothing about HOMOs and LUMOs, nucleophiles and electrophiles, all he knew was that the hydrogen went to the place that had the most hydrogens."
142,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-13,"After drill on the mechanism of the pinacol rearrangement, this lecture applies molecular-orbital analysis to simultaneous electrophilic/nucleophilic attack by a single atom to form a three-membered ring from an alkene. These reactions provide drill in consistent use of the curved-arrow formalism for describing electron-pair shifts. Two alternative mechanisms for formation of cyclopropanes by the alkylzinc Simmons-Smith “carbenoid” reagent are proposed, and the one-step mechanism is supported by theory. Epoxidation of alkenes by peroxycarboxylic acids also seems to go by way of a concerted electrophilic/nucleophilic process involving a single transition state. The stereochemistry and scale of various paths to epoxides is discussed in the context of their commercial utility.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","OK, so we’ve been talking about electrophilic addition and the nucleophilic aspect of it. So first, about that problem I gave you last time, about drawing nice curved arrows to show the pinacol rearrangement. But it turned out that having a little copper with the zinc made it work better. Ayesha, you got us on to this, tell us again, what orbital does it go into? So, a pair will go there, and now you got X and the R•. But, the R• is generated right next to the metal, so you can get a making of a bond between that radical and an atom in the metal. The HOMO is mostly a  orbital on the zinc, actually the LUMO+1.Now, if you bend the zinc, you’ll mix those two, they’ll hybridize. So, if you bend it, that’s the 4 on zinc, if you bend it, as it’s approaching the transition state, where the zinc is going to be approaching the C-C double bond, then you hybridize that central one and you’ve got an orbital that looks like this. Matt, what do you say, with respect to the alkene? S2 right, a backside attack by the high HOMO. First, you have the addition of zinc halide and the carbon group, and then in a second step, you do the S2-type reaction to form the second bond. First, we could look at how the thing moves through the transition state. Can you see any other thing that might be a low LUMO? So in principle, either of those might be the reaction. But at any rate, those are the two that you might consider at the beginning and once you’ve tried these several paths, then you can see which one’s going to give you the product that you know by experiment is actually the product, and it turns out to be this one, σ. Pardon me, that was the LUMO, here’s the HOMO, actually it’s not the HOMO, it’s the HOMO – 3, but do you see what it’s made of? Now we’re going to look at it as it interacts with the carbon-carbon double bond. So that’s an S2 attacking oxygen, not carbon of course. The  orbitals on oxygen are all filled with electrons. These attacks are always backside to break a σ. Notice that the O-H bond, remember that H is going to transfer from O1 to O3, at the transition state it is hardly stretched at all. No, it doesn’t tell you it’s an intermediate. That the deprotonation is the limiting step. This shows the motion, successive motions. The name of this transition state, they called it spiro transition state. In fact, you have water here that can also do it. We get that intermediate and react it with allyl alcohol. Notice that the source of oxygen is O in this case, that’s a really cheap source of oxygen."
143,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-14,"The formation of epoxides and the regiospecificity of their acid- and base-catalyzed ring openings underlines the importance of thinking carefully about how textbooks draw curved arrows and may sometimes read too much into fundamentally inadequate experimental data. The ozonolysis of alkenes begins with several 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions that can be understood in terms of matching HOMOs with LUMOs of the corresponding symmetry. The process continues with acetal hydrolysis and either reduction or oxidation to obtain the desired product. Mechanisms of these typical reactions are analyzed. Although addition to the C=O double bond is usually considered nucleophilic, it can have an important electrophilic component that makes it mechanistically analogous to the “electrophilic” additions to C=C being discussed in these lectures. The use of metals to access orbitals of the proper symmetry is introduced through alkene dihydroxylation  cycloaddition of OsO.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","In particular today we’re talking about cycloaddition, addition to make rings. It will attach onto hydrogen, CH molecule. Now the problem with that is that the anion you get is not at all a good anion. So it’s going to be very hard to pull off a proton, even though hydroxide, you’re right, is a strong base– better as a base than what you would expect for its nucleophilicity. Now suppose we’re going to do with H catalysis. And in fact, this is what’s called an  prep. But if you want to see how a reaction is really carried out, this is a very good source, and it tells you exactly what faithful yields are, not ones that have been exaggerated. Now, do you find that then convincing in terms of in acid you attack one and in base you attack the other? And it’s in the gas phase, and, of course, where a solvent is can make a lot more difference than 0.12 kilocalories per mole. So it’s not what you would draw if you just put a plus charge on the oxygen. Now you notice that when the phenyl attached to copper attacks, so that the polarization is such that the phenyl is mostly minus, so it’s the nucleophile, although it’s really more complicated because the copper’s around at the same time. So another pair of electrons gets stabilized as these atoms come together. Now this is cycloaddition of allylic 1,3-dipole to alkenes. We can choose the size of the  orbitals of the three. So the bigger the orbitals the more overlap. Now if you take another allylic system like CHBHCH, the one we were talking about, we can look at its  orbitals and there’s  and there’s  and there’s , and this one does, indeed, show biggest in the middle, so that’s satisfying. So that’s big on  and a little bit of the terminal oxygen. So the HOMO is the middle orbital, the one with the node. Now let’s go over to look at the carbonyl oxide and count its electrons. There’s no alkene-HOMO match with that LUMO, and no alkene-LUMO match with that HOMO. Use what you just formed instead of the three O’s, I’m not quite sure what you mean. So it’s another S1 kind of thing where we make the cation. So the book now gives examples where you see you could do this, first treat it with ozone to get the ozonide. So those are the two possibilities with ozonolysis. And this will remind you, if you think about it a little bit, of another reaction we looked at. So we start with this, methyllithium and the carbonyl, and there we have a HOMO, which is the lithium-carbon bond, mostly on carbon– that doesn’t surprise you. And notice that that looks like ozone, these three atoms in a row above the two of the alkene. So we can imagine water coming in and breaking it apart to give a double bond and two OH groups. In other respects, it’s not such a great reagent, and we’ll talk about that next time."
144,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-15,"Alkenes may be oxidized to diols by permanganate or by OsO catalysis.Metal catalysts provide orbitals that allow simultaneous formation of two bonds from metal to alkene or H. Coupling such oxidative additions to reductive eliminations, provides a low-energy catalytic path for addition of H to an alkene. Such catalytic hydrogenation is often said to involve  stereochemistry, but the primary literature shows that addition can be  when allylic rearrangement occurs on the catalyst. Similar oxidative/reductive cycles operate in olefin metathesis and metal-catalyzed polymerization. Careful catalyst design allows control over polymer stereochemistry (tacticity). Polymerizations catalyzed by free-radicals or acids typically lack stereochemical control, but there are ways to control regiochemistry and chain length. Latex, a natural polymer, coagulates to form a rubber ball.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","OK, we’re still talking about addition to alkenes. And in fact, this is called the Upjohn process, which is relevant because the guy whose picture is over here, whose estate gave the money for redoing this room awhile back, was the research director at Upjohn Laboratories. So the configuration you get at the two carbons, where the OH’s add, are related to one another. I think it’s now long gone, since that was 1988. What do you think, is that going to be a good reaction? Maybe on one side, but not as shown there. But if that’s the energy of the starting material in a pretty crummy calculation, so don’t hang your hat on this, these are successive stages as you go left to right. However, once it gets up there, these hydrogens can move from one metal to the next, because we’re talking a solid metal, in this case. So you get an advantage from entropy, from the hydrogens getting apart, even though it’s uphill a little bit in energy. OK, now, catalytic hydrogenation puts these two reactions together that we just looked at. And now we have room on the surface of the palladium, there, to bring in the alkene and do its trick. Now suppose we have that hydrogen that’s wandering around the surface, suppose we bring it back? And of course, if you put methyl groups on there, and it were 2-butene, then you’d expect to get that particular isomer of the 2-butene, where the two hydrogens operated, added on same side. That was not necessary, in this case, to tell, because you also have the cyclohexane ring there. But I’m actually doing this little bit to show you how to read textbooks. But notice, it doesn’t say what the yield is. So it shows an example, here, using palladium on carbon as the catalyst. You don’t have very much, so you put it on charcoal. And what do you would notice about the stereochemistry of the product? So it’s all these oxidative addition reductive eliminations, but if you go through that symmetric intermediate, then you can take the wrong one off as you go back toward starting material. So we can look at that reference, and see here where they give the table about studying these things. Just by the same processes we talked about on the previous slide. But now, that we could just call a different R group. And Kaminsky, the name associated with this catalysis, has to do with his accidental discovery that adding MAO makes these very reactive. And then the R group shifts across, and you make a bond. The original one was R. But now the next alkene comes in and associates with the zirconium, but what’s different from the first one I drew? This was the earliest kind of polymerization studied in laboratories. We start polymerization going, fine, free-radical polymerization. So if you have R as an electrophile, you do a really interesting reaction. What you think would happen first?Where is there a functional group? So this is a chain, it can go round and round. Now, if you don’t have the isobutane there, then it turns out that it could do this polymerization, add another one and another one, et cetera, et cetera."
145,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-16,"Isoprenoid or terpene natural products, that seem to be made from isoprene (2-methylbutadiene), are formed by oligomerization of electrophilic isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). Latex, the polymer of IPP, became commercially important when Charles Goodyear, a New Haven native, discovered how to vulcanize rubber. Statistical mechanics explains such curious properties of rubber as contraction upon heating when tightly stretched. Specific chemical treatment confers useful properties on a wide variety of polymers, including hair, synthetic rubber, and plastics. The structure of copolymers demonstrates non-Hammond behavior and ionic character in the transition state for free-radical polymerization.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","We’re talking about alkenes, and in particular today, we’re going to be continuing to talk about polymerization in the context of things that nature makes, which are called isoprenoids. That thing is called geranyl pyrophosphate, because it’s related to geraniums, as well see. It’s a different kind of reaction, we’re not going to talk about it. But, we’re not interested in the particulars of the biological reagent, but it makes an expoxide. Now you protonate that, and what will it do? Do the same thing again, do another Markovnikov addition. I’m not talking about cation/anion mechanisms, just schematic here. He tutored John Dalton for example, he lived up in the Lake District in England. He lived in Middleshaw House, near Kendal in 1802. Here he says, “Hold one end of the slip, of the rubber, thus prepared, between the thumb and forefinger of each hand; bring the middle of the piece into slight contact with the edges of the lips”; because he has to do it by touch, “taking care to keep it straight all the time, but not to stretch it much beyond its natural length: after taking these preparatory steps, extend the slip suddenly; and you will immediately perceive”– something. It may be that it’s, let me slide it out a little bit here, so that it’s not rubbing against the rod, there. It could be that the heat comes from friction of the molecules rubbing by one another. Did it get hot when it contracted, or did it get cold? People tried, everybody and his brother tried, to break his patent. There’s a zillion ways to have it if it’s contracted, so statistics, entropy says, it wants to have a shorter distance between the ends. So, then it will allow statistics to make the material contract like this, and you’ll go backwards. That’s what vulcanization does, so there’s no flow when hot, and it inhibits crystallization, so it’s not brittle when it’s cold. But, Robin Kelly did Irish dancing, and she wanted her hair to look like this, for Irish dancing. Designing a tire for your car is a very complex thing, to mix different polymers to get exactly the properties in different parts of the tire that are necessary. It has the double bonds to interact with the SOMO. So, if you have that particular radical at the end of the chain, it adds to styrene faster than it adds to methyl methacrylate. What would you expect if you have styrene as the last radical? So, the ionic resonance structure, you could say, stabilizes the transition state, or if you wanted to talk about it in terms of orbitals, you’d say that the C double bond O gives an unusually low LUMO, so that’s good when the SOMO is not so low. The product is not stabilized by that kind of thing, but the transition state is, which is what makes these things turn around and go A B A B A B. OK, now I was going to go on to acetylenes, but we’ll do that next time."
146,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-17,"Because of their unusual acidity very strong base makes it possible to isomerize an internal acetylene to the less stable terminal isomer. Many chemical reactions may be understood in terms of localized bonds, but the special stability of conjugated systems requires considering delocalized orbitals or “resonance.” Equilibrium constants, rates, and regiochemistry in systems involving allylic cations, anions, transition states, and free radicals demonstrate that allylic conjugation is worth about 13 kcal/mole. Regioselection in addition of DCl to 1,3-pentadiene reveals rapid collapse of an allylic ion pair. Allylic substitution of bromine can be favored over Br addition by using NBS to control Br concentration. Diene conjugation is worth much less than allylic conjugation.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","So we’ve been talking about alkenes and their polymerization. It’s possible to isolate that in 40% percent yield which seems funny, as we mentioned before, because if it’s not very reactive, wouldn’t the hexene you make be even more reactive, so that it would be impossible to isolate something that was part way along. But if you form the cation, make it next to the halogen so that at least you can profit from stabilizing the unshared pair on the halogen. Now, hydration and hydrogenation of alkynes. First hydration, we can do the same kind of thing we did before, the alkoxymercuration, which you might remember forms an unsymmetrical bridged ion, then water can open it up, and you get the addition of Hg and OH, hydroxymercuration. Just to remind you, this is where we went through it, added up the bonds, and showed that the ketone is much more stable than the enol. And so, you have a week to learn this stuff. You can get first this alkene, and you use a special catalyst, this is called… was developed by a guy named Lindlar, and he added lead to the palladium catalyst. Why might you want the catalyst not to be very active? It’ll do the acetylene, but it won’t do the alkene. So, you can write it as one being an anion with two electrons, and the other being a radical with the third electron. So, we have an anion radical as an intermediate. So it can react with the ammonia and pull off a proton. But that if you have an hybridized carbon, or an hybridized carbon, they get much more acidic. Remember, the PKA is 16, 4/3 of 16 is 21. Or if you want to, you could just add acid so that you don’t even have OH there, although, that’s gilding the lily. So you stopped equilibrium, you put the proton on the terminal acetylene, so you can go from the internal, the more stable one usually, to the terminal acetylene using the trick. But then in a second step we add bromide. Now, in fact, you get those in the ratio of 80% to 20%. But, the initial product formed at really low temperature, at dry ice temperature, is backwards. Hammond would say, you’d go faster to the more stable product, but sometimes, remember, it crosses and it’s easier to get to the less stable product, and that’s the example here. That’s where bromide would tend to be in order to attack. So one would think that this is exactly what Anurag has proposed, that it should attack there. If you do it at room temperature, at 25°, you get half again as much of this as you do of this. So the methyl group has to be on one end or the other of the cation you’re going to make when you lose the chloride, in order to get that acceleration. So again having these π things where they can overlap with the anion that’s being formed is very favorable. The lone pair is stabilized by the carbonyl π*. We can imagine doing a reaction of Br with a double bond. Then you can react it with Br and replace where the hydrogen is with bromine. You can use photoinitiation to get the radical. If you use, noticed this was done in the dark."
147,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-18,"Despite the substantial change in the energy of individual orbitals, the overall pi-electron energy and orbital shape changes little upon linear conjugation of two double bonds. Conjugation energy of polyenes and allylic systems may be predicted by means of a semicircle mnemonic. The much greater stabilization in “aromatic” conjugated rings, and Hückel’s 4n+2 rule, derive from alternating stabilization and destabilization of successive orbitals when the ends of a conjugated chain overlap as it is closed to form a ring. A circle mnemonic predicts orbital energies for conjugated rings. This aromaticity concept is generalized to heteroaromatic compounds like furan and imidazole, to polycyclic compounds like naphthalene, and to hydrocarbon ions like cyclopentadienide.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","OK, so last time we started talking about conjugation, the special properties that functional groups have when they’re adjacent to one another, in particular dienes. And then right at the end last time you guessed for me, and did the right thing, to show that the diene at the bottom is special because it’s conjugated, as opposed to the other dienes. So the important thing is to look at the how big the barrier is. Now there are two ways to look at butadiene. You notice that the best one is big in the middle. Now you can optimize things on the right too, and see why it’s not very important to do this change in size. But then the ones on the far right are the same as the ones on the left, if we let these interact with one another in two stages. Because the energy match was so bad, of the things we were mixing. So there the chain length is two for ethylene. We’re ignoring that, just to get an idea of what’s going on. Now the normalized atomic orbital size is 1 over the square root of 8. And that suggests, although it doesn’t prove, this construction that allows you to view what the energies of the orbital will be in this simple approximation for any length of chain. But in the allyl case it’ll look like this. So the favorable orbital is favored, compared to the electrons in the π-orbitals when they were isolated. What do you think the gap is going to be here? Unless, just to look ahead a little bit, you twist it and make a Moebius strip. If you have an even number of nodes, it’ll be favorable because you’ll have the same sign on the two ends. Of course, you also have to take into account the sigma bonds. Compared to a chain that’s not touching the ends. That means an odd number of electron pairs. It’s the same radius; minus 1 to 1 is the limit. So the cyclopropenyl cation, just two electrons that’s the energy you’re going to have. But there are two going down here, and one going up. This stabilization that we saw in benzene, aromatic stabilization, is the opposite here. So it has two that are in the sigma system that are irrelevant for our purposes. Now if we look at this, the next orbital here, it has two nodes, here and here. And it’s big in the middle, as you expect, because it has more interactions. So that has the same energy, here, here, and here. So it’s the same energy as ethylene would be, because it’s the same interaction. OK now can you make that compound, cyclodecapentaene? And now this thing could open that central bond to give this, and it does that. So here’s the CH bridge across the middle, but all around the periphery you have 10 atoms with p orbitals."
148,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-19,"Cyclic conjugation that arises when -orbitals touch one another can be as important for transition states as aromaticity is for stable molecules. It is the controlling factor in “pericyclic” reactions. Regiochemistry, stereochemistry, and kinetics show that two new sigma bonds are being formed simultaneously, if not symmetrically, in the 6-electron Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Although thermal dimerization of thymine residues in DNA is forbidden, photochemistry allows the 4-electron cycloaddition. “Electrocyclic” ring opening or closing chooses a conrotatory Möbius pathway, or a disrotatory Hückel pathway, according to the number of electron pairs involved and whether light is used in the process. Dewar benzene provides an example of a very unstable molecule that can be formed photochemically and then persists because of unfavorable orbital overlap in the transition state for ring opening.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)",": So we’re going to finish up talking about aromaticity, talking then about reactions, as well as molecules that are unusually stable. There are three benzene rings that help stabilize the positive charge, or„ to speak more accurately, whose electrons are stabilized by the vacant orbital on carbon. So that one is even more stable than the unusually stable triply benzylic one. So an ene and a diene and they react with one another with three pairs of electrons shifting to form a ring. If we rotated it at 90°, that’s true, but you don’t get the best overlap that way for forming a new bond. So to see the product then we have to unfold it. If this is the way it is in the transition state, try to think of it mechanically, we break this bond. How many think it’s going to be pointing away? OK, so now we can imagine this diene, the methyl substituted diene, to be either approaching this way or to be upside down. And when we do that this methyl group is going to come over here. So that’s why I took the trouble to draw it that way. Or it could just be that the transition state is a little unsymmetrical the way we showed in other cases, where a bridge thing like mercury wasn’t in the middle but a little toward one side. Because if you have an intermediate, then you would imagine that that could rotate here. Now, how about with respect to the diene stereochemistry? This one takes 15 hours at a much higher temperature, 30° Celsius hotter. Because the acetylene, when it loses one of its bonds, becomes an ene not a single bond. But when you want to do a synthesis project and you see that there’s a 6-membered ring with a double bond in it, you think Diels-Alder reaction. And here we see, I think, the motion that’s involved in going through the transition state. And notice there is a double bond here and a double bond here. So changing the π to the σ bond requires a twist in one of two ways. Or we could go through this other geometry and rotate this one counterclockwise, but the one on the left clockwise, and that’s called disrotation, they rotate in opposite directions. Either way would take these four groups here and make them in and out of the plane, as they need to be to form a σ bond. Is there a preference between these?Well notice, if you do it this way, that the  orbitals that are on top in the starting material are bending in toward one another. So that’s like these things that were involved in in the Hueckel, rule where you have a ring and they all touch one other on the top. So that will happen– here is at the transition state, and you see that when you have the mirror that’s happening. Now let’s look at– there are three pairs of electrons were talking about, that’s the lowest one of the starting material. And the problem is this, this reaction is exothermic by 16 kilocalories because you’re converting a π bond into a σ bond. And then they used H to do the displacement to convert that into methyl. Benzene would look like this instead of being a hexagon, it would look like this if you rotate it the wrong way."
149,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-1,"This second semester of Freshman Organic Chemistry builds on the first semester’s treatment of molecular structure and energy* to discuss how reaction mechanisms have been discovered and understood.  It also treats the spectroscopy and synthesis of organic molecules.  Reactions and their rates can be understood in terms of reaction-coordinate diagrams involving the passage of a set of atoms through the “transition state” on the potential-energy surface.  Analysis of bond-dissociation energies suggests a chain mechanism for free-radical halogenation of alkanes.  Experimental determination of kinetic order provides insight into complex reaction schemes, especially when one step is rate-limiting.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","I hope you’re rested and ready to go again. We’re not going to have a textbook this semester either. But we’re going to use it to talk about the concepts of reactivity and selectivity–when you can get different products, how do you control or predict which ones you’ll get?Then the nice thing about free radicals is they’re not charged, so they’re relatively insensitive to solvent. R-H becomes R plus H atom—R radical plus H atom. So less electron stabilization means a weaker bond. The vinyl and phenyl are much stronger, 10 kilocalories stronger. Now it can mix with the  because it’s going in and out of the plane. But the others go up and down, the ones that came from the  and the . So you get net stabilization due to this pair of electrons going down. And the same is true for the benzyl radical where the  orbital on the adjacent carbon, again can overlap with the  system of the benzene ring. What does that tell you that as you go down the rows of the periodic table, you don’t get some monotonic up or down in the bond strength, but it goes up and down? So is break-two-bonds-then-make-two a plausible mechanism? What might you be able to do to realize such a reaction? And we already know a better way to go about it from looking at these potential energy surfaces for transferring an atom between two other atoms. First you take chlorine and you break its bond. And now the product of that is HCl, one of the products you want. So we know the energies of the starting material and products for each of these steps, but we don’t really know the activation energy–how much you have to come up before you come down. But even if we could predict the rate of Step 1 or Step 2, there’s still a problem, because the overall process is not just one step, it’s two steps. So that’s why we’re particularly interested in it. Then there’s a rate law that’s some constant times the concentration of something. You double the amount of material, double the concentration of material, and it doesn’t change the rate. Again, this is easy to demonstrate using calculus, but it’s just sort of cute that you add forward and reverse rate constants together to get how rapidly it approaches equilibrium. But suppose the transition state energies are like this. So it’s very slow to get to the intermediate. The rate at which you get product is the rate at which you get this. So to the extent that that intermediate is in equilibrium with the starting material, and we treat the rate of going over here as an equilibrium between the intermediate and this transition state, we could also pretend that the transition state is in equilibrium with the starting material, since they’re both in equilibrium with the intermediate. All we have to know is how high it is compared to the starting material. When you get to here it’s 9 times as much of one or the other and so on."
150,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-20,"Time-dependent quantum mechanics shows how mixing orbitals of different energy causes electrons to vibrate. Mixing  with  causes a vibration that can absorb or generate light, while mixing  with  causes “breathing” that does not interact with light. Many natural organic chromophores involve mixing an unshared electron pair with a vacant pi orbital, whose conjugation determines color. Infrared spectra reveal atomic vibration frequencies, which are related by Hooke’s law to bond strengths and “reduced” masses. Infrared spectra are complicated by the coupling of local oscillators of similar frequency to give “normal” modes. Alkane chains possess characteristic stretching and bending modes, with descriptive names, that may, or may not, absorb infrared light.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","OK, so we’re ready for a new phase here, to talk about spectroscopy, the interaction of light with matter and what it can tell us about molecules. It can show spectral transitions for the H atom. OK, you can see the shift, as we saw last semester, from mixing  with . And the oscillation frequency, how rapidly it goes up and down, that is what color of light would interact with it, what frequency of light, has to do with the energy difference between  and .So here, this is just a footnote. And now that’s an interesting question, because it depends on what– the magnitude of the energy for any given system– depends on where you define 0 to be. And this would suggest that the rate of oscillation depends on what you call 0. So why do you have it in there in the first place? You only care what the difference in frequencies is. So now it doesn’t depend on what you call 0, because the one state you’re taking and the other state you’re taking have the same difference, whatever 0 is. But in those cases, we weren’t trying to mix two real states, that’s why I said “actually” up there. But normally, the atoms whose bond you’re interested in vibrating is part of a whole molecule, and then things get more complicated, as we will see. When things vibrate we often think of them following a sine wave. Notice here, there’s a little rod that goes out here under the spring. And it goes out until it makes a little fork there around the spring. And this means you could use this thing to measure the frequency. And we don’t need to go into why that is. But what that means is that that effective mass– use the Greek µ, the Greek m, µ instead of m– that’s dominated by the smaller mass. A C-O bond has a heavier mass, 6.9 versus 0.9. But it’s not that simple, because a single atom is connected, not to just one other atom, but others, and they couple with each other. So this, our study of coupled oscillators is going to illustrate several things. Because we’ve added this spring to however hard it is to bend that. The meaning of it is that, in that pattern of vibration, all the atoms are oscillating at the same frequency in a normal mode. This one’s not moving nearly as much as that one is. They stay mostly independent, if they have different independent… different individual frequencies. It’s an exact analogue of the energy-match and overlap thing, where the energy-match is now how different the frequencies are, or the energy-mismatch, and the overlap is how strong this spring is between them. But it’s not that simple, because they get mixed up, according to frequency-match and coupling, into 36 complicated normal modes. Let’s see if we can understand what any of the peaks are. So the charge is moving up and down, up and down."
151,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-21,"Infrared spectroscopy provides information for analyzing molecular structure and for understanding bonding and dynamics. Although the normal modes of alkanes involve complex coordinated vibration of many atoms, the unusual strengths of multiple bonds give alkenes and alkynes distinctive stretching frequencies.  The intensity of characteristic out-of-plane C-H bending peaks allows assignment of alkene configuration. Characteristic carbonyl stretching peaks in various functional groups demonstrate the importance of pi- and sigma-conjugation.  The complex fingerprint region of IR spectra differentiates the subtle isomerism of polymorphic crystalline pharmaceuticals. A 90° phase lag between force and velocity explains the precession of tops and of magnetic nuclei in a magnetic field. Nuclear precession in the combination of a stationary magnet and a pulsed radio-frequency field can be visualized by means of the “rotating frame.”Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","I’ll have a good answer key for you soon. So the frequency of the light has to be exactly the same as the natural frequency with which the molecule vibrates. That that one was the coordinated stretching of the C-H bonds, as indeed with the field pushing up and down. And in fact, of the 10 C-H stretches that combine to give 10 normal modes involving C-H stretching, half of them have no handle, and you can’t see them in the IR.But we can go on to other peaks. Here we were looking just at a saturated alkane. What IR is especially good for is identifying functional groups. Incidentally, what does -yne mean as a suffix?: So that’s characteristic of having an acetylene in a molecule. There’s no change in the dipole moment, because it’s symmetrical as you move like that. But if it’s -4-octene, then if you stretch the double bond, and change the bonds from carbon to carbon, you change the dipole moment in this direction, not in this direction. So if you have it  like that, then the dipole change is actually in a different direction. Now, of course, the others that don’t have that extra methyl group are  and , but have two H’s, two H’s , or two H’s . Now, this is the vibration we’re looking at, out-of-plane vibration of the C-H. Everybody see what I’m talking about? Why don’t I show the one where one moves up and the other moves down? Now, why does it stand out in its frequency? π*; here are the electrons on the atom we’re interested in, on oxygen or nitrogen.: But why does it strengthen it to have a halogen there?So here’s a different kind of resonance. Of course, that’s not the dominant structure, but it’s one that causes the bond to get, the C=O bond, to get stronger. It’s out of phase, and it’s mostly a vibration of the C=O. And that’s the one that’s at high frequency. So there’s a little influence of the neighbors on the frequency. It might be a combination of some other freak transitions. The actual amplitudes are very subtle for these things. OK, so here’s the second form, Form B. And again, it has ammonium. So this is the legal world and IR being involved in it. He thought they were real, that there were real little filaments there for these lines of force. The strings pulling that way, but its weight, if I let go, is going to make it fall. So normally it would just fall down, but if it’s spinning it falls around. The precession of a top looks like some kind of miracle involving right angles and circles, and twists and right-hand screws. As it goes up it gets more and more force to the right. Where is the velocity fastest to the right? And this is how fast they precess in a magnetic field. You see it going back and forth as it is like that. But what would a proton look like if we were going around it at 100 MHz? If it weren’t spinning it wouldn’t precess."

When protons in different parts of the body can be driven to broadcast different frequencies, tomography allows reconstructing a three-dimensional image showing water location. Dependence of the signal intensity on relaxation allows BOLD functional MRI that shows brain activity. When the applied magnetic field is sufficiently uniform, chemical NMR spectra differentiate proton signals according to local field variations within molecules. Modern research in a chemical laboratory like Yale’s depends on the availability of many magnetic resonance spectrometers. Peak integrals show the relative number of protons in different molecular environments, while peak frequencies or “chemical shifts” show the bonding environment of groups of protons. Often downfield (deshielded) or upfield (shielded) shifts are correlated with local electron density.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","Can you remember back to when we, before break, what we were talking about? You should be able to pick up a radio signal at 100 MHz. In fact, the energy is so small, of the interaction of each of these magnets with the field, that there are ones pointing the opposite direction, with higher energy, almost exactly the same population. The higher the field, the faster they precess, the higher the frequency. So essentially, we’ve made a big solenoid magnet that goes along the body’s axis. So we know there are protons in the body. So if I went, like, 25 millimeters, about an inch, that would be 1000 microtesla, that is a millitesla. But in the second slice they’re going to be at 63.05, about a part per 1000, because there’s a higher field near the head. So just like we did with the X-rays scanning down. I now know how much water there is at different places along the height of the body, or the length of the body. And in fact, by putting a certain amount of current in all these coils at the same time, different amounts in different coils, I can make a slice that goes in any direction I want to, and find out how much is there. So the way you tell something about them, is to take a difference. That difference signal, tells you how it shifted for bonds. So the brain is working harder when it’s in one state than the other. So we can’t do this trick, or can we?So we want to locate protons within molecules. And, of course, then there was X-ray, which really did show where atoms were. And in it he put two capillary tubes that had water in them. So he did exactly the kind of experiment we were talking about. And I already showed you some X-ray diffractomers around, which have put classical structure proof by chemical transformation, the kind of thing that we talked about Koerner doing, and even IR, mostly out of business, although there are still things for which IR is as good or even better than NMR.And, in fact, there was a Yale– before I came here, there was a organic chemistry professor who was in the field called natural products, where the job was to take something that came from nature and figure out what its structure was. And the electron magnet is 660 times stronger than the proton. The conclusion is that the structure must be B, not A. So that’s a classical structure proof by chemical transformation. But here’s a completely different way of going about it. Now, why would they pay the bucks, the big bucks, to get deuterium rather than just using normal chloroform, CHCl, for a solvent. So these molecular fields then tell you about the molecular environment, these tiny shifts. So there are two sources of these local magnetic fields, besides the enormous big field that you put on. This B is bigger than it would be if there were fewer electrons around. This scale is the chemical shift numbers, and that’s defined as zero, so it’s a very low number. There is very small, relatively small, magnet effective field, relatively small. So there’s more to it than what we’re saying. But the good news is that when you hear it, you’re going to be able to impress your roommate, because this is due to diamagnetic anisotropy."
153,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-23,"Through-space interaction between magnets of fixed strength and orientation averages to zero during random molecular tumbling, suggesting that the local field about a proton should be sensitive only to electrons that orbit about itself. The chemical shift can be sensitive to electrons orbiting elsewhere if the amount of orbiting varies with molecular orientation. This “diamagnetic anisotropy” is commonly used to rationalize the unusual chemical shifts of protons in acetylene and in aromatic and antiaromatic compounds. The other source of a proton’s local field is nearby magnetic nuclei, which can be counted by the splitting multiplicity. Unlike chemical shift, which is measured in fractional units because it depends on the strength of the applied field, this spin-spin splitting (), measured in Hz, is dependent only on molecular structure.  depends not on spatial proximity, but on orbital overlap, which, remarkably, is larger for anti- than for eclipsed conformations.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","OK, so we’re talking about NMR spectroscopy. So, as we said last time, the precession frequency of the proton in a molecule depends on the magnetic field they see, which is mostly this enormous applied magnetic field. So that it’s as if the proton is on a perfect ball bearing or something. That is, energy, not parts per million, not a fractional unit. It’s shifted downfield, compared to other hydrogens on carbon-carbon double bonds. The reason it’s there is because you put the applied field on. Now that creates the field that’s opposed to the applied field in the middle of the ring, but reinforcing the applied field out where the protons are. So this is exactly a situation of diamagnetic anisotropy, where you have the effect for some orientations and not others, and now there’ll be a net average field, due to the circulation in these  orbitals of carbon, as seen by the hydrogens, which is what you’re looking at in your NMR spectroscopy. Now, this then provided, once this was appreciated… NMR came along. How is this different from the case in aromaticity? So the lines of force go exactly the opposite direction. And Professor Wiberg has done calculations and observations that show that it doesn’t work for C-13. And it’s just as likely as the others, so it’s 1:1:1, but you can also have one down and the other up, the opposite direction. There are the ones where they all oppose the field. But this is measured in Hertz, in energy, because it doesn’t depend on the applied field. And then it would be 1:4:6:4:1, but it doesn’t look like that. And furthermore, not only is it a weaker magnet than a proton, so that it’s only 1.8 Hz, it can be oriented three ways in the field. And this one is slightly bigger than that one. So we’ve looked at this in pretty much detail. So it can be like this, or it can be like that. Zero, because now you’re not going to get diamagnetic anisotropy, because this magnet has nothing to do with the circulation of electrons, and where the paths are. How do we get splitting if the through-space interaction of magnets won’t do the trick? Can I see the hands of those who are surprised? Now let’s look at ethane here, and look at those two protons, top-right and bottom-left, and look at this particular molecular orbital, which turns out to be HOMO - 3. It can’t be the blue one, when the blue one is up there. So the electrons provide a way to communicate between the nuclei. So it’s as if the nuclei were interacting with one another. So the J, the magnitude, depends on the  orbital content of the various molecular orbitals. So let’s just look at this one where the difference lies. This one, it says that the coupling is 6 to 8, and that’s fine."
154,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-24,"Because spin-spin splitting depends on electron spin precisely at a nucleus, splitting by a C-13 depends on its orbital’s hybridization. “Higher-order effects” that give complex multiplets for nuclei with similar chemical shifts can be understood in terms of the mixing of wave functions of similar energy. Averaging of chemical shifts or spin-spin splitting may be used to measure the rate of rapid changes in molecular structure, such as changes in conformation or hydrogen bonding. Since the spectroscopic time scale depends on frequency differences, averaging is easier in NMR than in IR. A typical problem involves predicting the NMR spectrum of a compound with diastereotopic groups. In proton decoupling radio frequency irradiation of a particular proton can make it cease to split the NMR signals from nearby protons.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)",": So we’ve talked about the main events in NMR spectroscopy for determining structure. Those were then changed to be called Hz nowadays. This is where double bonds normally come. Remember, we drew a resonance structure where the blue ones were more positive. So if we measure in Hz, as we’re doing here, they’ll come closer together, but  will stay the same, because it doesn’t depend on the field. Or at 0.86 Tesla, it would be 3.Notice, incidentally, that this would be a much cheaper spectrometer, because it would have only 1/10 as big the magnetic field as the other one. Now notice that that part in the original spectrum was a mess, because all those hydrogens of the benzene ring have similar chemical shifts, and they’re all coupled with one another so it’s more of this same thing, and all on top of one another, and very complicated, so we’ll forget that. So they could both be with the field; that would be low in energy. Or one with and the other against, or one against and the other with. And the difference has them pointing opposite directions altogether. So the radio frequency light loses its handle on the flanking peaks as ∂ becomes small compared to , as shown here. There are more protons there than just one. It’s an average of both the OH that’s on the alcohol and the H.Now let’s see, how did that happen? How fast does it have to be to see a blur, or to see the average as a sharp average, rather than to see the two distinct things?This particular sample is a solid, so you could imagine that these are held in place by the surrounding molecules. Well suppose you have two different swings. Suppose that it goes at 22 Hz for a while, then at 20 Hz for a while– it’s in a different environment. Then at 22 Hz, then at 20 Hz, then at 22 Hz, then at 20 Hz for a while. It’s how long the pulse is compared to the difference in frequency. But you can’t do that in the IR, because the differences in frequency are so large. And then they’ll also be split by these with different coupling constants and so on. So cyclohexane gives a single sharp peak. Those are removed by one, two, three, four bonds. Sebastian, you shake your head slightly.: Slightly deshielded by two oxygen atoms on the neighboring carbon. So it’ll be shifted down more than this one was. So that’s going to be really, a whole bunch of them. If the rest of the molecule is chiral, those will be different.: It doesn’t feel as much torque, it doesn’t precess as fast. Or there are other ones that have exactly the same steady field in the opposite direction. So it precesses much more slowly, it’s a smaller magnet, and it can be either up or down. So both these things are happening when we put it in a magnetic field. So if you put enough power in on the hydrogen, you remove the splitting from the C-13 spectrum, which can be handy, as we’ll show you next time."
155,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-25,Proton decoupling simplifies C-13 NMR spectra. Dilute double labeling with C-13 confirmed the complex rearrangement scheme in steroid biosynthesis. Two-dimensional NMR yields correlations between NMR signals that underlie structural determination of proteins and identification of the mechanism of a rapid carbocation rearrangement. Substitution of an electrophile for a proton on an aromatic ring proceeds by a two-step association-dissociation mechanism involving a cyclohexadienyl cation intermediate. The relative rates of forming various products from substituted benzenes correlates with the substituents’ influences on the stability of the various cyclohexadienyl cation intermediates. The spectrum of electrophile reactivities is very broad. Important contributions for activating electrophiles were made by Friedel and Crafts working in Paris.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011),": So, we’ll finish up on NMR spectroscopy, talking about more dynamic things involving decoupling. And there are two peaks, because of the adjacent proton. Now here’s a C-13 spectrum of a given compound. This number up there, 40 decibels, is an inverse ratio of how strong that horizontal field is for the protons. And if we look at the carbon, we see that some of the carbon signals are split and some are not split. And see what happens, is we start increasing the power. And notice, incidentally, that the CDCl didn’t get stronger as we did this. It would be 100 times stronger, because it would be 100% instead of 1%.OK, so here’s a compound, neotame, it’s an artificial sweetener. People put in known compounds and figured out what the chemical shifts… what peaks were from one compound to the next. And then they figured out this comes in this range, this comes in this range, this comes in this range. Rahul, what do you say they have in common?: They all have an electronegative atom next to them, right? And we’ll talk about lanosterol biogenesis. The blue and the red one are going to split each other. So the carbon got away from its original neighbor. So this double labeling absolutely proves that these rearrangements took place. So the red is near the blue is near the R. So you know which NH is near which R. And now the way you make a map, then, in this way– Professor Loria, who does this kind of thing, uses this analogy– it’s like making a map of a town if all you have is a telephone and a telephone book. Especially if you have some help, because you know in the case of the protons, they have to fit with normal bond distances, normal bond angles, and so on. And what happens quickly is a 1,2 shift, not a 1,anywhere shift. You can use other electrophiles as well, not just D, you can use NO, Br, sulphur, R, and RC=O. All these things can substitute for hydrogen, and we’re going to talk about those. Now, the mechanism is that the deuterium, D, the deuteron, adds to the ring. You make it by just having a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acid. Notice, incidentally, that NO is an interesting molecule because it’s exactly the same as CO, except it has one more proton in the nucleus of the central atom. That is, if you have 25 times as much benzene as toluene– the one with methyl on it– you’ll get equal amounts of the products at first, until you’ve used up all the toluene. So in that case of oxygen, there’s this unshared pair on the oxygen, which can overlap with the  orbitals on the benzene ring. And finally, you have the third of the allylic orbitals, that one. Now there are two things about a substituent, X. Does it make it go faster, or does it make it go slower, is it activating or deactivating? And if you have an ester group, the same kind of thing is true. So Cl would be a great nucleophile, but you don’t  buy Cl, you have Cl. Just like NO, except that CO isn’t nearly as low as NOwith its extra proton. And you see it’s ortho/para directing, not meta directing. And it was named after Charles Friedel and James Mason Crafts. So this is a great example of where America stood in international science in the last part of the 19th century. And then he was ill, but also tired of not doing research. And notice he did most of the publication during this second period in Paris when he was doing only research."
156,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-26,"The Friedel-Crafts reaction creates new alkyl- or acyl-aromatic bonds, with or without cation rearrangement. Designing reaction sequences, especially those involving diazonium intermediates, so as to access a wide variety of substituted benzenes provides a good introduction to the challenges of synthetic organic chemistry. Aromatic rings with strong electron withdrawal can undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which plays an important role in biochemistry. The special properties of phenyl-substituted alkanes, especially benzylic reactivity and steric hindrance, played an important role in the development of organic chemistry a century ago.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)",": OK, so we’re finishing up on talking about aromatic compounds, about the chemistry of benzene. You know, this was a big deal in the 19th century, in part because you had reactions that were clean. So the Friedel-Crafts reaction we were just beginning with, and we’ll talk today about some ideas about how you design syntheses, and about benzylic stabilization, the reactivity at positions next to an aromatic system. So although he was an American, many people thought he was French. So Wurtz was in France, and he wrote this in his thing about a special reaction of iodides with sodium. So they tried reacting alkyl halide, alkyl chloride with aluminum, with the idea of getting R and aluminum chloride. And an interesting thing about the aluminum: they found that they reaction was initially very slow. They tried a number of methods of oxidation, but the one that gave a good yield was to treat it with cold potassium permanganate for two months. It comes in nature, probably from oxidizing graphite or something like that, I don’t know where it comes from exactly. And it was the triphenylmethyl chloride, but it didn’t have chlorine anymore, because they worked it up with water. Now that was done at a slightly warm temperature. Well, remember the aluminum chloride comes up and starts pulling off the chloride and makes a complex like this with the incipient cation. So now you have this unrearranged ketone. Like the Clemmensen reduction, treat with the zinc and hydrochloric acid. Or you could put a nitro group on, we said, with nitric acid, sometimes with sulfuric acid, if you need it to be more reactive. So there are lots of different things you can put on benzene this way. And you might wonder, why would you do that if you went to all the work to put it on? That one probably does involve losing N from the cation to form the phenyl cation, which then pulls off a fluoride from BF. You could also react it with NaNO to put NO on. It’ll make the reaction slow, but still it’ll happen. But if not that one, there’ll be another one that allows you to reduce it. Because this is the chemistry they were doing at that time. We’ve got not only the wrong group, nitro instead of methyl, but we’ve got it in the wrong place. Or if it’s too reactive– remember that the rocket fuel was a nitration of something like that– you could acetylate it, if that’s necessary. How to make para-dinitrobenzene with the reactions that we know about here. But this clever thing, that he, as a good chemist, figured out how to do, is nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Now, another place this crops up is in NAD, which is this compound. Notice what’s going onto the benzene is H with the electrons, H. It’s helped out by the unshared pair on oxygen coming in here. So let’s look at what kind of thing you would have taken if you were getting a BS in chemistry, as it says up here, at Michigan in 1890. You might think as an immigrant who had worked in the stockyards, he would be trying to do some practical work. And this is a different way of making carbon-carbon bonds."
157,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-27,"Painstaking studies of his “hexaphenylethane” and its reactivity convinced Gomberg that he had prepared the first trivalent carbon compound, triphenylmethyl radical, the discovery of which marked the emergence of fundamental organic chemistry in America. Isotopic labeling could decide whether protonated cyclopropane plays a role in Friedel-Crafts alkylation. C-13 NMR spectra of aldehydes and ketones show how characteristic chemical shifts are established empirically. The carbonyl group is thermodynamically stable but kinetically reactive. Its acid- and base-catalyzed reactions often involve loss of α-proton to form an enol or enolate intermediate. Carboxylic acids display four fundamentally different reaction patterns. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of acetals illustrates a multistep reaction mechanism involving the carbonyl group.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)",": We introduced the idea last time about triphenylmethyl, so I thought you might like to see a space-filling model of triphenylmethyl, and feel it, how it works. It’s true that the models have fixed angles and don’t distort easily, these models. Not like Friedel who spent four years first, and then 17 years in Paris. So he was really confident that he had tetraphenylmethane. You can easily do an S2 [correction: S1] reaction, because the chloride will come away to give the triphenylmethyl cation, and then O will go between. But he found it was very funny because this substance not only reacted with O, it reacted easily with Cl, with Br, and even with I, which you remember doesn’t add to alkenes. He said, “Triphenylmethyl…The experimental evidence presented above forces me to the conclusion that we have to deal, here, with a free radical…”Remember where radicals came from? On this assumption alone do the results described above become intelligible and receive an adequate explanation. And here in October 1900, he wrote a paper, published it in America, received October 4th. “ But at the same time, he published it in Germany. All the center of gravity was in Europe, especially in Germany, at the end of the 19th century. So what I want you guys to do is to try to think up an experiment that can tell you whether it’s the S2 or the S1 mechanism. And we’ve seen that the second bond in carbon is very much weaker than the first bond. And with one more carbon, 2-butanone, they found that. Now, a different kind of reactivity is when one of the substituents on the carbonyl can be a leaving group in an S2 reaction, so it’s an OK anion. Remember, electrophilic aromatic substitution goes through a tetravalent carbon, then the proton gets lost and you have the electrophile left on there. And that’s what’s discussed in Chapter 18.But there are other ways to go at it too, because the oxygen has unshared pairs, so acids can attack it. Or it can be OR, and we’ve already talked about that, hemiacetal, or on the way to an acetal. So a base can come in and take the proton. Put two carbonyls adjacent to this α thing, so now both of them can stabilize it. Because this one is– you’ve gained the aromaticity, that 30 kcal/mole that you didn’t have over here. Well first, you can get addition, just as if it were a carbonyl group. But there’s another possibility in the acid. That when you have the OH and put the R on, making the R-O bond, that’s an α substitution also. Well, we could just have it leave now, right? Because it’s O, so it’s going to gain full ownership of that pair of electrons, so it becomes ROH neutral. We have ROCH left, what do we draw on the CH?: Same way: Tell me what we’re going to do."
158,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-28,"This lecture aims at developing facility with devising plausible mechanisms for acid- and base-catalyzed reactions of carbonyl compounds, carboxylic acids, and their derivatives. When steric hindrance inhibits the A/D mechanism of Fischer esterification, an acid-catalyzed D/A mechanism can still occur. Substituent influence on the equilibrium constants for carbonyl hydration demonstrates four effects: bond strength, steric, electron withdrawal, and conjugation. Cyclic acetals play an important role in protecting the carbonyl groups of sugars, but acetals also can be used to protect alcohols, as can silyl ethers. Using amines instead of alcohols allows converting carbonyl compounds to imines  carbinolamines.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)",": So we’ve started talking about the mechanism about carbonyl chemistry. So nucleophilic substitution of acid derivatives. You can have substitution at carbon, where you make a new carbon-oxygen bond. And it’s substitution at carbon of a carboxylic acid to convert it into an ester. Because water’s a good leaving group, and so that O just put the H… or you put the proton on–: I’m not asking what’s a good leaving group. Why protonate this one instead of that one? And now this is strictly analogous to that. So you can go either way, trading them back and forth. So this tetrahedral intermediate is hard to make if R is really big and crowded. We can’t do Fischer esterification that way. Now what happens when you put it into concentrated sulfuric acid? So then you’ll– that inhibits the reversal, as we just said. So this CH could run into the H. But also, the CH gets more crowded because we’ve got two O’s on here now. Is it going to make the equilibrium constant greater or less than one?: Notice that here we have an  bond to carbon and here we have an bond to hydrogen. But the carbon-carbon bond is more sensitive to hybridization, gets stronger when you go , than the carbon-hydrogen does. So this one was a stronger bond than that one, with respect to the hybridization. So it should shift it to the right, and indeed, both the bond strength that we just talked about, and the steric hindrance both suggest that it should shift to the right. So it should shift the equilibrium in that direction. Or we did the reaction going the other direction, now I’m going back. OK.But suppose what we wanted to do was get the ketal, not the hemiketal, OK? You’re going right back where you started. It can’t pull it off from the R. And you can’t do an S2– pulling the R off would be like doing an S2 reaction, where hydroxide attacks the R, and this O leaves. But there’s something that makes it good. So we can make a ketal, right?Now, it’s possible under those circumstances to do reactions with alcohols to chew up the other alcohols, but not chew up this one. So this is protecting that particular carbon from being reacted by having a full ketal there. Stabilized by the lone pair on the oxygen.: It’s an association, followed by dissociation. Pardon me, it would be originally NH, when we use the unshared pair, but then we can lose the H. So now we have this functional group, which is called an imine, which is rather like a ketone."
159,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-29,"Imines are pervasive in chemistry and biology, playing key roles both the in artificial Strecker synthesis of amino acids and their biosynthesis by L-glutamate dehydrogenase and by transamination. Imines are also involved in Stork’s α-alkylation and acylation of ketones by way of enamine intermediates. Oxidation and reduction in organic chemistry can involve actual electron transfer, when ion-radical intermediates are involved as in the formation of Grignard reagents or in the pinacol reduction. But more often in treating the covalent molecules of organic chemistry atomic oxidation states are used as an artificial bookkeeping device that helps suggest reagent choice for transformations that do not involve literal electron transfer. Oxidation states are assigned by pretending that covalent bonds between different atoms are purely ionic.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","So as we said, most of the lectures nowadays are about carbonyl chemistry. So you made a couple of these derivatives, measure their melting point, and then you knew what ketone you had, if you didn’t have NMR to help you out. So you get special stability on the right. Now, there are other cases where imines are very important. That makes a negative charge on the nitrogen when you formed a bond. And we already know that could react with water, right, to liberate ammonia. And then you can change it into a carboxylic acid group. Now it’s not only in the laboratory that this kind of thing happens where you go through an imine. And we’d have the amino acid at the bottom. OK?Now, does anybody recognize what this fragment is? So it has a nitrogen and an oxygen on the carbon. Now, you can also get what’s called alpha-substitution  a relative of the imine called enamine. Chris?The imine is the C=N double bond, but without the charge, because you lost the proton. In fact, it’s very reactive, because the N makes that double bond even a lower LUMO than the π*. The proton gets pulled off by the hydroxide. So you need two of them, if you want to get the reaction to go. The product is this, in 71% yield, from doing this reaction. But nowadays, we understand it in terms of electron transfer. And those actual reactions occur in organic chemistry. And it behaves a lot like you might expect CH to behave. And if you then add water to put protons on the Os, you can get pinacol. And this is called the pinacol reduction. Because we’ve classified reagents as HOMOs and LUMOs and what they can react with. So one electron came from the carbon we’re talking about, one came from the other carbon, but we now split it 50-50, since they’re the same electronegativity. One bond to carbon and then three bonds to hydrogens, so that would be -3: So it’s -3 again, like the methyls on the left. Remember, bromonium ion, bromide comes in, and so on. So the aluminum would be +4 with four hydrogens, because hydride is more electronegative than aluminum. Karl, what’s the oxidation state of sodium in this?: But you know in order to make the disulfide bridge, you need an oxidizing agent."
160,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-2,"Curious kinetic orders can be mechanistically informative. Fractional kinetic orders suggest dissociation of a dominant aggregate to give a smaller reactive species. An apparent negative kinetic order, due to competition with a second-order process, leads to spontaneous deracemization of chiral crystals. Changes in bond dissociation energies can be due to differences in bonds or in radicals. Although it is often said that the order of alkyl radical stability is tertiary > secondary > primary, careful analysis suggests that the order of bond dissociation energies may be due to differences in the alkanes rather than in the radicals. Hammond helped organic chemists begin to think systematically about predicting relative reaction rates by suggesting that the transition states of more exothermic reactions should lie closer to the starting materials in structure and energy.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)",": Today’s the day I should have welcomed you to sunny New Haven I guess. If you double it, you have twice as much of the dominant species. So if the dominant species is proportional to how much you add, that’s how much you think you have. Then the equilibrium lies to the right, and when you ladle 8 times as much material in–you don’t ladle it because it’s very reactive with air and water–but if you increase the concentration by a factor of 4, this is what you increase by a factor of 4. I better turn those off to get better definition on the slides. Fractional order when things have to come apart. And that’s to say that that’s why the radical is more stable. That is, they say that it has to do with this radical stability. And see what they say about what the explanation is. That is, it’s going to be different depending on which atom we’re pulling away, but the relative stability of the radicals as we go across a given color should be the same, if that’s the explanation. These are relative bond dissociation energies, taking zero to be methyl. So what they tend to say, for example, the Jones and Flemming book that I mentioned, on page 479,  bonds to carbon are preferentially stabilized the more substituted radicals. So if this trend is due to radical stabilization by these two phenomena, then whatever X we break off we should show the same trend. And that could make the starting material unstable and relatively easy to break the bond. That’s how much strain energy there is in the starting material. And we calculate by molecular mechanics, if we have normal C-C and C-H bond distances, normal angles at carbons, how much strain will there be due to things running into one another. It adjusts, as we mentioned last semester, to minimize the energy. What I’m showing you is an endothermic reaction. You have that in your mind’s eye?So I can go back and forth, knowing the energy difference between starting material and product, I have some idea what the activation energy might look like. And if that were so, then you notice that an endothermic reaction would have a high transition state. So they would have the same kind of strip. So we’re not going to try to do absolute energies like this–that’s way too hard. But we’ll hope we can at least do relative energies if we look at analogous reactions. So we make those, by definition, the same, because we’re going to compare relative. So if the transition state, when this bond is partly broken because X is taking H away, if it were a late transition state like that, an endothermic process, then it should have a late–if it were a late transition state it should have pretty much stabilization by resonance. It might not be quite a straight line, but at least it’s steadily going down."
161,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-30,"A difficult exam question shows how visible and NMR spectroscopy related to long-term misassignment of the structure for the triphenylmethyl dimer. Evidence from 1970 shows that Friedel-Crafts propylation involves an S2 mechanism, not a protonated cyclopropane. Assigning oxidation states from -4 to +4 to the carbon atoms of proposed starting material and product allows choosing whether a reagent that is oxidizing or reducing or neither is appropriate. Beyond belonging to the appropriate redox class, the reagent must have an appropriate mechanism. Alcohol oxidations by elemental bromine and by Cr reagents are shown to involve familiar substitution, elimination, and addition mechanisms. Mechanistic understanding allows adjusting conditions to make oxidation selective.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","So we’re talking about oxidizing and reducing reagents, and about alcohols, and Grignard reactions to make them. So I showed you, during the exam, this dissertation from the University of Michigan in 1921. That’s what he decided he had made, on the basis of their reactivity. So anyhow, if you consider this structure, notice that you have the explanation for two hydrogens here, the blue one, two hydrogens here, the green ones, a hydrogen here, the red one, and you have coupling between these two of about 10 Hz, so it’s a double doublet, right?And it’s distorted, though, because this 60 MHz spectrum, the chemical shift difference, isn’t large compared to the -coupling. But if you look even more carefully, you can see that there’s a 3 Hz coupling between the red hydrogen and the green. So it’s quite clear what this structure is, that it’s this quinoid dimer, once you have the NMR to see it. So the stuff it was in equilibrium with was not colored. And in fact, Deno found in 1968 that you did that, and that it was randomly distributed, because the hydrogen can zip around the periphery of the protonated cyclopropane. How to decide whether the Friedel-Crafts reaction really is an S2, where benzene is a nucleophile and displaces chloride from a thing like this, either before or after the methide shift, or whether it’s an S1 reaction. So one carbon got oxidized, but the other carbon got reduced. But water does work in oxidizing-reducing scenarios. Actually, I should have worked this through better ahead of time. But notice that you can… or another alkene would be RCH=CH. You don’t need an oxidizing or reducing agent. And how do we get, say, the bromide from the alcohol? How do you get at something that’s not a functional group? And that would require from here, doing a second free-radical substitution. And that we could get from an acid, without using an oxidizing or reducing agent. So we get Br•, taking the hydrogen, and we’ve done this before. this Cr=O. So you can imagine adding water to give Cr, O, O, OH, OH.What’s the oxidation state? You lose this H and this H. And then you would have OH, C=O. So you over-oxidize all the way to the carboxylic acid. And then the proton is given to pyridine to make a pyridinium cation. If you look at what Wikipedia says about this, there seems to be the voice of experience writing."
162,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-31,"The ability of periodic acid (HIO) to cleave the C-C bond of vicinal diols and α-hydroxycarbonyl compounds allowed structure determination of sugars and their ketals before spectroscopy was available. Reduction of carbonyl compounds by organometallic or hydride reagents provides a range of schemes for synthesizing various alcohols, where preference may be dictated by the desire to avoid competing processes. Wittig olefination allows conversion of C=O to C=C with good control over constitutional isomerism. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have taken great interest in developing new solvents and reagents that minimize hazards, waste, and environmental impact of traditional reactions.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)",": So we’ve been talking about oxidation and reduction. Of course the double-bond Os can be hydrated, so you can have OH, OH in place of a double-bond O, but this is a simple form of writing it. But I said not… Suppose it’s not a– suppose it were a carbonyl group, C=O. No OH on the group up at top. So remember what sugars are, are a bunch of carbons in a row. Now the one… not only the one in the middle of the chain has only one H on it, but the one at the top has only one H.So from that one, you’d get a formaldehyde and two formic acids, right? Both for the aldehyde that was formerly here– and that’s its oxygen– and for the alcohol that was here. Think what would happen with this with HIO. Would that be something that would react in order to give this product? Then, of course, those electrons could be used to form a bond to the metal, and you get that intermediate. In fact, we can’t even start with this, because that’s a carbon that goes into the product. Because the oxidizing agents that oxidize alcohols also react with aldehydes. because this is not a particularly good carbon to be reactive. This one was in a position that was a carbonyl. Now we need a nucleophile and an electrophile. So then what would you use on the right?: But you’re going to have problems, depending on how you do it, of over-oxidation. And now finally, how about if we wanted to make that one instead? Now, suppose you want to use t-butyl instead of methyl. And you see that the carbon part that was t-butyl loses magnesium and loses H to become the alkene, and the other product, then, is that 65% yield alcohol. So those are other things that can happen with Grignard reagents. But you can do it in this case with a stronger base. So it’s especially acidic, but not so acidit that you’re going to pull it off with OH.So you could draw a resonance structure where you have a double bond, where not only the phosphorus has given electrons to the carbon in making the bond, but the carbon has given electrons back to the phosphorus through this d-orbital interaction. The other product is losing a different α hydrogen. It’s a more stable alkene, more highly substituted. But at least these are their ideas, and they’re people that have a great practical interest in it, not only in the sense of there are things they want to happen, but they’re willing to give money to people to try to help make it happen, to do research projects, to try to develop new ways of doing it. So they were trying to decide what they would most like to have. And so you can see a real problem with this. But the miscibility with water is what makes them bad, because it’s hard to get out of the water again. A better way of activating OH for nucleus  substitution. So they need something better than the available hydride reagents."
163,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-32,"Spectroscopic determination of bond dissociation energies is relatively straightforward for many diatomic molecules, but for polyatomic molecules it requires merging the results from a variety of challenging experiments. Professor Ellison describes how such techniques as flowing-afterglow mass spectroscopy and negative-ion photoelectron spectroscopy together with data on free-radical kinetics and heats of formation have allowed precise determination of the O-H, C-H, and C-O bonds in methanol and other compounds. Interpreting these reliable data provides new insight into the nature of chemical bonding and “resonance.”Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)",": OK, well, today we have a guest lecture. And so I told you we would try to have him speak with you about where these things really come from, how you know what bond dissociation energies are. So if you have methane, and you want to measure the bond energy, I literally want to reach in and measure the energy it would take to grab that hydrogen and literally just rip it out of there. And when you can see it does that, the molecule is going to have a change from a tetrahedral geometry to a flat geometry. That gives you the energy of the negative ion here. And here, this is the easiest way, I think, about this. And if you take a vapor of the negative ions, you make a fast beam. If the product radical is vibrating, then the photoelectron kinetic energy will be smaller than the measured binding energy. You can actually take a vibrational spectrum. And then when you’re running, these people basically are dancing around the machine nude with tambourines, just trying to keep the machine stable long enough to get a spectrum. If Bierbaum has the acidity, and you know the electron affinity, and you know the ionization energy of hydrogen atom, so here are these numbers. If you have a base that you try to pull a proton off the carbon, the electron is going to be on the carbon atom, and that’s bad. So Professor Bierbaum uses a set of pumps which are as big as I am. So it turns out that if you have these guys, you now use the heat of formation of methyl radical. So this is the other thing I’m going to need. So we have to make a beam of these things. This is about the same thing it is for the CO bond in methanol. And this is a testament to the guys who did these measurements. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder. So that’s how you know what the lowest energy is. And it will actually be in the CO stretch, is where this will be. So if there’s energy in the negative ion, then, to go back to my diagram– if you have hot bands, in other words, if some of the molecules have vibrational energy in this, then the molecules aren’t down here, v equal to zero, but they’re actually populated in higher states here. And you can always spot them, because they’ll have a different frequency. You’re going to have a set of frequencies here, which will be a mode in the neutral molecule. And so this is a vibration in the negative ion. So now you’re going to have to begin to tell which OH this came from. Would you say that this radical is stable because you can draw resonance structures that have the electrons over here. I don’t like the fact that the oxygen is going to have– you’re starting to suck electrons– if the electrons migrate down, the oxygen is going to become positively charged. All these compounds are long, three-dimensional polymers of aryl alkyl ethers. So Barney says it’s because he doesn’t like to separate charge in resonance structures."
164,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-33,"Green chemistry needs new asymmetric reactions and safer, more environmental Mitsunobu reactions. The Mitsunobu mechanism is general and reliable, but atom inefficient, generating almost 30 times as much weight of by-products as of the water it is designed to eliminate. Admirably green processes include autoxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids using only O, and oxidation of alcohols by loss of H using a ruthenium catalyst. Relative pK values of carboxylic acids provide insight into the role of inductive and resonance effects in organic transformations. One analysis suggests that the special acidity of carboxylic acids owes four times as much to inductive as to resonance effects. Carboxylic acids can be prepared both by oxidation and by reduction.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)",": OK, So now we’ll come back down to earth after Professor Ellison’s talk. And the final one is asymmetric addition of HCN.Notice, incidentally, that four of these eight– half of them– have to do with asymmetric synthesis, making chiral things. So let’s see what that means, active methylene compound. Diethyl– so it’s an ethyl ester on both ends, notice it’s symmetrical– azodicarboxylate, DEAD.Now, this is sort of a complicated scheme. And now this HX is one of these things that has a K less than 15. And notice, at the same time, the nitrogen-nitrogen, which originally was a double bond, now has two hydrogens on it. And now X is able to do the nucleophilic substitution, and that’s how the Mitsunobu activation happens. And at least this aspect of it has been improved. And in fact, we already talked about such a reaction last semester. It was one of the first oxidations of an aldehyde that was studied, which was the oil of bitter almonds. It had converted spontaneously to benzoic acid without adding any chromium, manganese, or anything like that. So it’s like a hemiketal, except it’s peroxy. So what could be a more efficient reaction? And I thought this one was a very interesting one. So you can imagine that the hydride attacks this hydrogen, which loses these electrons to make that bond. So let’s redraw that thing and look at what happens if there’s an alcohol. And again, I think that should be two Hs. So sometimes they’re very good, compared to the gas chromatography yield. But in this particular case, it’s hard to separate, and you only get half as much out to sell to your neighbor as you had analyzed by GC.So you can also make imines and amides and so on with these catalysts. So this is an interesting analysis, in terms of resonance structures. So it should be about 15 kilocalories per mole. Only 15 kilocalories uphill, instead of 30 kilocalories uphill. So you could also have an inductive effect due to the oxygen. So it’s an interesting question whether you count the oxygen once or count it twice. But one way or the other, it would be good to check it. And now that’s plus 37.3.Now, what does it involve? And now we have no resonance on the right. There’s one different type of oxidation that we haven’t talked about yet which is mentioned in the Jones textbook here, which is alkyl groups attached to a benzene ring can be oxidized by permanganate at 100° to make carboxylic acids, as well. But there are more oxidized things, like CO.So if you had CO, what would you react it with in order to form a carbon-carbon bond to make a carboxylic acid?"
165,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-34,"Reactions of carboxylic acids and their salts include nucleophilic substitution and decarboxylation to leave enols, free radicals, or alkyl halides. A review of the IR spectroscopy of acid derivatives includes the use of vibrational coupling in the structure determination of anhydrides and imides. Many acid derivatives can be interconverted by substitution through a tetrahedral intermediate, and differences in acidity can be used to drive such reactions toward completion. Reduction of acid derivatives illustrates the challenge of designing selective reactions. Acidic and basic mechanisms allow conversion of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Ketenes provide routes to several acid derivatives. The Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of ketones to esters illustrates atom insertion into acyl-R bonds.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","So more today about the lore of acids and acid derivatives, which you’ll find in chapter 17, 18. But there are other ways to do decarboxylations from acid. And it undergoes this shift of the electrons– single electrons, it’s a radical process– which is fast. So you can convert a carboxylic acid to the alkyl bromide with one less carbon atom. To take RBr and substitute the Br with an acid group, CO, put another carbon on the chain?We’ll actually talk about this some more later. But we had shown an example that if you have cyanide– which is a nucleophile, so you could do an S2 reaction, put cyanide there– but cyanide has the same oxidation state of the carbon as the acid does. But how can you get the σ to be high energy?: There, as we just mentioned in the last slide, the carbon has a +3 oxidation level, because X is electronegative, something with the unshared pair there. So you can go between these things and acid just by treating them like water. It doesn’t look like you’re dealing with the same thing. So you don’t need an oxidizing/reducing agent, and you can just do that with water. And that the reason for that was that you could get this other curious resonance structure. So there are two normal modes, both involve both of the C=O bonds. And it turns out that that’s difficult to do. But it’s quite intense, because they’re both going the same direction. Now, which group will leave from that intermediate, X or Y? As exemplified in the p.So if you could make the most energetic one, the top one, the acid chloride, then by adding the others successively, you could make it into any of the other three; or the next one, the acid anhydride, into either of the other two; or the ester into the amide, and so on. You can go back and forth from one ester to the other. So you could have hydroxide come in and OR go out. So treat it with KOH, and you have this reaction take place. That she knew that she could wash her hair with this stuff, even though you put lye in it. What’s going to be different?Well, if you went through, you replace the chloride by R, same kind of trick we’re doing here, or H. Then you replace the other chloride by Hor R, you get an aldehyde or a ketone. You’re using expensive reagents to make something cheap. Now you can use a really weak carbon nucleophile, high HOMO on carbon, that will react to give the ketone, but won’t react with the ketone, because it’s so weak. Let me just use the other board here for a moment. So we talked before about converting the CN to a carboxylic acid. So in base, you attack the CN triple bond, as if it were a CO double bond."
166,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-35,"When a nucleophilic atom bearing a good leaving group attacks a carbonyl group, an adjacent Rgroup can migrate to the new atom, inserting it into the R-acyl bond. This mechanism can insert O, NH, or CH groups into the acyl bond with informative stereospecificity in the case of the Beckmann rearrangement of oximes. Although the migrating groups are formally anionic, relative migratory aptitudes show that they give up electron density during rearrangement. Acid dissociation of protons a to a carbonyl group to form enolates, and the ease of forming enols, gives α-carbons nucleophilic reactivity under both basic and acidic conditions. This explains H/D exchange and racemization as well as halogenation and alkylation of α-carbons.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","We started last time talking about acyl insertions, although I’m not sure I mentioned the term. You could displace it with a carbon nucleophile. Or an alkide, shift, we say, like a methide shift. So it’s not as unstable as you might have thought. The polymer– I’ll write it this way– is called nylon-6. And the way that one goes is first, to react with SOCl. And now, nucleophiles can do association-dissociation and displace the chloride. Plus minus– which is called a diazoketone. So I’ll just use the slide to talk about that. Why is it that the ester is less prone to form the anion by losing that red proton than a ketone is?I could make the opposite argument. In fact, this has the same acidity as the ester does. Nitrogen comes before oxygen, so nitrogen has less nuclear charge than oxygen, so it’s unshared pair is higher in energy. So the amide is a little bit like a carboxylic acid. But if you put two R groups on the nitrogen, so it doesn’t have a hydrogen it can lose, then indeed it’s less acidic than the ester, which is what you predicted once you get the periodic table right. Now, you can do even better if you have two carbonyls. So this allows you then to form carbon-carbon bonds with the other kinds, the electrophilic carbons, by using that unshared pair to form a new bond. So we can, in the enolate, we could bring in deuterated water. So you can put one in, one iodine, one chlorine, one bromine, but you can’t put the second one in, because you can’t, with acid catalysis, get the enol. This one had a methyl ketone in it, that one didn’t. So it was Hell did it first, and then Volhard, and then Zelinsky, at about two year intervals flanking 1885.So the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky– I forget whether I’ve got this animated here or not– involves PBr and bromine. So this was easy to do, because the acid bromide is good at forming the enol."
167,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-36,"As in many synthetic procedures, an important challenge in ketone alkylation is choosing reagents and conditions that allow control of isomerism and of single vs. multiple substitution. β-Dicarbonyl compounds allow convenient alkylation and preparation of ketones and carboxylic acids. The aldol condensation, in which an α-position adds to a carbonyl group to generate a β-hydroxy- or an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, can be driven to completion by removal of water. The Robinson annulation reaction is an important example of conjugate addition to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. α-Acylation of esters as in the Claisen condensation is a key step in the biosynthesis of fatty acids. Determining the constitutional structure of sugars posed a daunting challenge to early carbohydrate chemists.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","Since it’s going to take a minute for this to start up, I’ll show you a demonstration here. It takes an enormous amount of solvent to get it out. More liquid boils up and comes in and dissolves. So a little more about the reactivity of acid derivatives, and then on to the sugar– glucose proof, one of the finest logical creations of the 19 century– or ever. And the attack would be from the top, because it would come in on top of the  orbital of the carbon. Now, in fact it turns out– so that if it attacked the carbon, it would attack from the top, as shown up here on the right, out of the plane. LDA can also be used with carboxylic acids. Because you don’t have this really super strong base that could pull off two protons. What they’re after is protonating those to give the beta-keto acid or the malonic acid. Because when this was still an ester here, this was CH, acetoacetic acid. It was discovered first with acetaldehyde, which, treated with base, makes the enolate. So these are things that when you’re looking at something you want to make, and you see, aha, it’s a beta-hydroxycarbonyl compound, or it’s an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, you think, the aldol reaction. Now, the equilibrium for this is favorable, because this isn’t very crowded with H and H here, and H’s down here, and H here. So these things we talked about before, about using really strong bases to pre-form the anion, those are ways to do this. But it’s also a way to make aldol because of what you put in the cup. So that the pi* of the carbonyl will stabilize the anion. It adds, as you would naïvely have expected, to the carbonyl group. But when you’ve been around, you know what to do. And when BH adds, it adds an H, and also the boron, and that’s the way you get an alcohol, remember, the hydroboration/oxidation. Now a very interesting reaction is called the Robinson annulation. So you would get it from this forming the bond across there. So that was what he was hoping is a way to try to make this five-membered ring with that methyl group, which is hard to put in there otherwise, “by intramolecular change,” which we would now call rearrangement. But this is making a bond from here to here. Except you have to be sure that you’ve got the right anion here, that the anion is, at that position, the enolate that you’re starting with, and not at that position. So in fact, when I made these slides, I could use exactly the same slide and just plug in one group different each time. But once you do this very exothermic reaction, taking up one of those hydrogens, then the reaction is favorable again. And then it gets reduced again to put H in here. Because it makes them this way, and always adds two carbons at a time to the chain. So these, then, are sugars, but who knows which one is which?"
168,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-37,"Modern spectroscopic tools show not only the constitution, configuration, and conformation of glucose but also how it interconverts between isomeric hemiketal pyranose rings. One of mankind’s great accomplishments was determinining its constitution and especially its configuration before such spectroscopy. By 1887 Heinrich Kiliani had established the constitution of glucose as an aldohexose, and with help from Emil Fischer, he developed a method for homologating aldoses. Fisher assembled a great deal of experimental evidence on interconversion of natural and artificial aldoses, and their derivatives, especially their crystalline osazones. In 1892 he used this evidence to prove logically which of eight aldohexose configurations corresponds to glucose and to provide definitive support for van’t Hoff’s stereochemical theory. In 1991 Cram, Tanner, and Thomas reported the NMR spectrum of antiaromatic cyclobutadiene, which they prepared by photolysis inside a clamshell molecule that they designed and constructed in order to isolate this highly reactive molecule.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","I realize it’s reading period, so we’re supposed to be having fun. So we saw last time that there are carbohydrates, and I found who used the word first. And we remember that Couper, as soon as structure became something that you could talk about, because of the tetravalence of carbon, he proposed that there was another water added to give the hydrate of glucose, which is just fine. Or you can do the next carbon or the next carbon and ketones, so you can have ketoses. The one that’s attached to the carbon attached to oxygen.: But if you take them apart, one of them is glucose, and the other is levulose, which is also called fructose. And it was found in 1876 that lactose treated with acid gives also glucose, but another one called galactose, which comes from the Greek word for milk. The aldehyde on the end has been reduced, in this case. Because in this paper in 1855, which fortunately I’ve translated here, he says, “While a large number of compounds are very easily formed upon oxidation of dextrose”– remember, dextrose is glucose, it rotates light to the right– “by dilute nitric acid or by halogens, these molecules retain six carbons bound together in a chain. They had this interesting idea in those days that when they dissolved sodium in alcohol, it generated hydrogen, but this hydrogen was more reactive than most hydrogen and could reduce things that normal hydrogen gas couldn’t do. If it’s a ketone here, you break the chain. It’s very, very, very difficult to get crystals from them. Active methylene adjacent to two carbonyls. And then, what I told you last time is that when you hydrolyze this, you get the acid, and then it decarboxylates. So you get diastereomers, depending on which side you add from. Because it gave a way to convert one sugar into another sugar. So a Kiliani-Fischer synthesis on arabinose gave this compound. But let’s keep it simple just by showing the D-sugars, because as Fischer well knew, he had no way of telling D from L. You could measure the rotation, but not the absolute configuration. Then you can go right, right, left, left, right, right, left, left; and finally right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left. But not arabinose and xylose, because as we just saw, Kiliani showed that arabinose was a five -arbon sugar, not a six-carbon sugar. How could it be different?It could be the aldehyde was on the top, made two acids, reduced the top to an alcohol and the bottom to an aldehyde. So there’s some special relationship between glucose and mannose, that all three of these things do that. xylose, wood sugar, by the Kiliani-Fischer synthesis, added a carbon and made gulose. You put it in, you think it’s not chiral. So we’ll put that on the back burner for a second. So from Item 1, we know for sure that it’s not that and not that, glucose. Both the enantiomers are known when the two ends are the same. This one, would that have a plane of symmetry? So we know something now about arabinose and xylose. He finds the crucial bits of evidence and puts them together to do this really beautiful proof. So I thought you would want to know about that. And then with light, it loses CO, and you get it. So you protonate that, you have an electrophile, it forms a bond, ortho-para, you’ve got the first bond made. So now they had to join the two hemispheres, which they put a lithium on in place of the bromine. So most of the peaks come from these hydrogens in the shell."
169,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-38,"Discoverers of the structure and biological activity of steroid hormones won seven Nobel Prizes between 1927 and 1975. Studying the steps involved in Woodward’s 1951 “total” synthesis of cortisone provides a review of the organic reactions covered this semester. Many steps involved novel insights, others were based on lore from previous work in the area. The overall yield of such sequential syntheses is typically much lower than that of convergent syntheses. Practical syntheses of cortisone were based on modification of related steroids readily available from nature. Milestones in total synthesis include both purely intellectual work with natural products and commercially important synthesis of designed pharmaceuticals. The course ends with thanks to those, young and old, who have taught us all.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)",": Well, from the happy hubbub I gather you’re as eager as I am to get this over. So very small amounts of them go around and make various things happen in your body. In fact, they were recognized as so important that work on steroids awarded four Nobel Prizes between 1927 and 1950, and another three between 1965 and 1975, which were, at least in part, due to work on steroids. So Reichstein then, the Swiss chemist, took 1000 kilograms of adrenal glands from cattle, and was able to get a 1 kilogram of dry residue from that and follow the activity as he parcelled it out, including using Girard’s ketone reagent T.Remember, we talked about that’s the thing that makes a hydrazone, and that it has a permanent cationic charge, so it will take a ketone into water, then you can take it off, and it’ll go back into the organics? So this was this fishhook to extract ketones. In nearly all cases, this could be elucidated in all its details. Because it’s so far away from any other functional group. So this book that I talked about uses as an example of a total synthesis Woodward’s synthesis in 1951 of cortisone. This is going to be a handle to build the rings A and B. So we’ll see how that works. So this compound was known and readily available and cheap. But we need to get this OH off to get down to what he wants to build this over here. What does an alcohol do with the acetic anhyride? And the next step is to build ring B, and also, to protect the double bond here, so it won’t react when other double bonds react. And you make it by reacting a ketone, acetone, with a diol. So you had to first protect this, then get rid of this one. It’s like making an α,β-unsaturated ketone, except it has this nitrogen on it now. That was already known 50 years before, right? So they’ve got both right- and left-handed stuff there, and they want only the one enantiomer, ultimately. And then they could do sodium borohydride that made the alcohol that we showed you before. Heymann and Fieser”– that’s the guy that wrote this story, right– “have recently converted the acetoxy-ester (III) into  V.” So here’s the reference to that. Now, how about a practical cortisone synthesis that could make something that people could afford to use? But you can imagine ways that you could get at it. How are you going to put the ketone in?And this is where it was found, actually, by this guy here, or by his research group. And I know where they got the paint, because I got it. You can’t imagine all the problems that were faced by this. All the operations had to be conducted with every conceivable precaution in respect to purity of reagents, exclusion of oxygen and moisture, and with the greatest possible speed. He ultimately synthesized palytoxin, this compound, which has CHNO. So Kohler was a student of Remson, who was at Johns Hopkins. And I actually had Onsager as a colleague. And next to her is the Biology professor from Bowdoin whom I’ve quoted. You know who Caroline Doty is, a basketball player at UConn."
170,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-3,The reactivity-selectivity principle explains why bromine atoms are more selective that chlorine atoms in abstracting hydrogen atoms from carbon. A free-radical mechanism for adding HBr to alkenes explains its anti-Markovnikov regiospecificity. Careful analysis is required to understand kinetic order for reactions involving catalysts. Termination of radical-chain reactions can make their rate half-order in the initiator. Selectivity due to protonation of radicals and their reaction partners illustrates the importance of ionic charge in determining reaction rates.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011),": So we were talking last time a little bit about the reactivity-selectivity principle. The same difference overall in the products. But the actual change in energy is much more positive in the case of bromine. And bromine, the less reactive agent, is more selective. So this is called the reactivity-selectivity principle, and it only can apply to the extent that the transition states are mirroring what the products do and that the two reactions are very, very similar to one another, and there’s not something else that makes the reaction transition state come much earlier or much later with a much different structure. If it’s early you don’t see much of that increased stability. There are actually special factors that apply only in the transition state. So it gives that intermediate carbon radical. And we’ve converted X-H to X•.So if we look at the average bond energies involving fluorine, for R-X, the product, we have 116 that’s going to go in here. In the case of chlorine it’s still exothermic–that should be not as fast but easy still. But you can’t do that with free-radical reactions. We’ll talk about that when we come to it. Remember you needed some way to have a radical to begin this whole process. So if you have R-O-O-R, a peroxide, and HBr and the alkene, the first thing that happens in this mechanism is that you break the O-O bond to get two R-O radicals. Now you have the radical that could do a hydrogen abstraction. And the concentration of the free radicals will adjust the ratio of the two to make those two equal. And you’ll notice, as Sharpless said in that lecture, if there’s a slow step, like this one, then there’s 99.9% of the titanium is what he was calling about–remember we talked about that last time. If you get that barrier down then the rate goes way up. And if you get them all at the same height then you’re really rolling. This ratio is half that ratio, very close. So the rate’s obviously going to be proportional to the amount of radical. And the reason it’s weak is because you have repulsion among these unshared pairs of electrons that you don’t have in the other cases. So now how about the kinetic order in the amount of initiator? And at steady state, once the thing is cranking along, the rate of initiation, which is this, here, and the rate of termination must be the same, because we’re in the steady state, we’re not changing the number of machines. So you can slow down the termination by protonating these free radicals. It’ll get a secondary hydrogen, not the primary one–we’ve talked about that already. So now that substitution reaction could either be the radical substitution, this mechanism going like that."
171,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-4,"A student provides insight on fractional-order rate laws. Bonds involving atoms with lone-pair electrons are weakened by electron-pair repulsion. Electronegativity differences between atoms make ionic dissociation (heterolysis) easier and radical dissociation (homolysis) harder, although Pauling’s definition of electronegativity makes the logic of the latter effect somewhat circular. The course transitions from free-radical reactions to ionic reactions by discussing solvent properties, in particular the electrostatic properties of alkyl halides and alkanes.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","I want to start with a question that was asked by Ayesha after the last lecture regarding fractional-order of kinetics. You’re not going back to the starting material; you’re not getting back to the peroxide. So this isn’t an equilibrium, as it was in the top. So on the 2009 exam I asked consider this chlorination reaction–the one we talked about at the end of last lecture–and certain bond dissociation energies, and then you’re supposed to figure out various things. So that seems a plausible explanation for weakening O-O versus C-C or N-Cl versus C-Cl. Actually, it was Henrietta Silliman Dana was her maiden name. That’s just to give you a little local color. You multiply by 23 to get kilocalories per mole. Now observed values are this; the bonds are actually stronger than you expect. So he called these things, this scale, electronegativity. In other words, he’s taken the periodic table and he’s distorted it like that so that the numbers go from red to yellow, as you go from left to right. But one passage in that I thought was particularly timely. But the idea of polar bonds having high bond dissociation energy in terms of what we talked about first, how far the electrons have to go up when you break the bond to get two free radicals, we expect that energy mismatch will strengthen bonds. Or how much energy does it take to pull an electron away from a charged ion. Free-radical halogenation introduces a functional group into alkanes. And if the atom in the middle is H instead of R, then this same thing is acidity. So we have to go beyond the molecules themselves in thinking about this reaction. Because it’s often possible to focus on the simple unit with strong interactions, that’s molecules are the individual units, and bonds within them are the strong interactions with well-defined geometries and energies, as we discussed last semester. There’s the strong force–that’s for physicists, that’s way above what we deal with in chemistry. Here are some values taken from the Jones book. But chloroform, ether, and hexane are not very polar; they don’t cut it down very much. And whatever textbook you have you’ll find this–When we talk about different functional groups we’re talking about the alkyl halides now. Now we already see here how much they’re separated, that is, what the distance is. So there were two things going on to give the dipole moment. Now compare that if the group there is CH. Because CH has this effective van der Waals radius. So methane, methyl with hydrogen, is very low boiling, and then it gets higher and higher and higher. So you see if you look at fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine atoms, fluorine atom is very non-polarizable. Next time we’ll start at this point and go in and try to understand the boiling point of the alkanes without the halogen on them."
172,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-5,"Most organic reactions occur in solution, and particularly in the case of ions, one must consider non-bonded interactions with neighboring molecules. Non-bonded interactions, including hydrogen-bonding, also determine such physical properties as boiling point. For the most part these interactions may be understood in terms of electrostatics and polarizability. Artificial or natural ion carriers (ionophores) can be tailored to bind specific ions. Energetically the ionic dissociation of water in the gas phase is prohibitively expensive.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","So as we move from radical to ionic reactions, HOMO-LUMO reactions, we have to take into account solvation. We might begin nucleophilic substitution. And then if you have a base around it–it doesn’t have to be a strong base–you can pull off the proton and lose the chlorine–chloride simultaneously in an elimination reaction to generate the carbonyl, and I think a lot of people got that. So the base that removes the proton could be a very weak base. So there’s something that can take the electrons as the base pulls the proton off. And neopentane goes down by another 18 degrees. So if you have the same atoms, for example, here in normal pentane, so we got five in a row, we have to get the atoms close together to allow their polarizability to hold the molecules together. But one of the factors is certainly that the positive charge gains stability by polarizing the material that’s around it. When it’s a really short chain, the fluoride is a little bit like–that’s methyl fluoride–that’s higher boiling than hydrogen. But the electrons have nothing to do with the weight. That’s hydrophobic forces–that’s like the grease, they stay apart. If nothing else there will be the mutual polarization of one atom by another across this boundary that will tend to hold things together. It has so many electrons out there that could be polarizable. It’s like the alkane, the neopentane–the atoms want to be close to one another to be low in energy. Anybody that has a theoretical technique tries to do it with water. You could go further and not lose too much. So you have a tall target there and a small target on the other one. So it’s lower in energy when the hydrogen is on one end or the other. And a maximum, local maximum, in the middle. If you look at the very lowest energy level for moving the hydrogen back and forth, you’ll see something interesting. And the barrier is very low, only 0.6 kilocalories per mole. And the potassium sits right in the middle with three above and three below, and I’ll pass that around so you can see it. And if you look at the actual value, not just relative to one another, which was what’s plotted first but the actual value, you see that it’s over a million, this equilibrium constant. But notice what this does when you put this crown around the golf ball. So this has worked out in lab in a way that’s shown here. So I don’t know that it’s never purple, but that’s what he told me. So maybe purple benzene looks sort of yellow, according to Professor Ziegler. And you don’t have to use crown ethers for this, although they are used for it. But we’re going to look at it a different way as to what’s involved, what role the solvent plays in this."
173,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-6,"The coincidentally substantial extent of ionic dissociation of water provides an example of Brønsted acidity, or nucleophilic substitution at hydrogen. Relative pK values are insensitive enough to solvent that they provide insight on the role of energy-match, overlap, and resonance in ionic dissociation. The titration of alanine in water illustrates the experimental determination of pK values and the phenomenon of buffering. The limited pK scale in water can be extended dramatically by titration in other solvents, providing one of the best ways to measure many “effects” in organic chemistry. A wide range of important organic reactions discovered in the 19 century and many biochemical reactions can be understood under the rubric of nucleophilic substitution.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)",": So as you know, we’re getting on to ionic reactions, and started by talking about how important the solvent is. So it’s more, in that case, more than just a dipole. If you put another water on that you get another 18 kilocalories per mole. Because it’s not only a bond, it also gets the positive charge in close proximity to a bunch of other electrons. Because in the first place, whether a molecule is ionized or not is important for predicting reactivity–that is, the availability of HOMOs and LUMOs–how high, how low they’ll be depends on whether it’s an ion. So that’s why acidity is particularly important in organic chemistry, because it could predict organic reactions. And if we take the logs of both sides and rearrange a little bit, we see that the pH is the p minus the log of the ratio–how much of the stuff is ionized and how much of the stuff is in the acidic form. Which one gives up its proton more easily? That oxygen has a higher HOMO and holds the proton more strongly. But notice the bond association energies. So during this region when the ratio is some place close to 50:50, it takes a lot of conversion in order to change the ratio very much. So the p is 2.35.Now it’s reasonable that the proximity of the positive charge to the carboxyl group that’s going to be losing a proton, having the plus charge here–what Lauren was telling us about–is going to make it, here it is, 300 times easier to remove the H from this cation rather than acetic acid, which was 4.5 in its p. So we went from 4.5 to about 2.5. The same way this one was easier as compared to a normal ammonium ion. That seems absolutely backwards—that it should be 300 times easier. And it depends on which ones you use to do that. Now here’s an acetylene that loses its proton, and it’s 20 powers of 10 better at losing the proton. So these are interesting tables to look at to see if you can figure out–look at molecules that are very similar to one another–so solvation will be more or less the same and you don’t have to worry about that–and see what it is about the change from one molecule to the next. How can you explain these trends seen over similar compounds?So here’s the problem for Wednesday. So let’s see if we could use these ideas in understanding nucleophilic substitution and β-elimination. They were discovered by people fiddling around with things and seeing what would happen. And it’s only 100 years or 150 later that people began to really understand what was going on. But sodium chloride is not soluble in acetone. Now here you have a HOMO on the nitrogen and a σ LUMO of the carbon-oxygen. And you can substitute the nitrogen for the oxygen. And that is this stuff you may have heard of, SAMe, -adenosylmethionine–you can buy it in vitamin stores."
174,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-7,"S2 substitution provides an example of establishing the mechanism of a chemical reaction by disproving all the alternatives. Five general pathways are envisioned (two-step involving either pentavalent or trivalent carbon intermediates, and one-step). They can be discriminated by applying a variety of experimental tools including stereochemistry (Walden inversion), rate law (second order and pseudo first order), and the variation of rate constant with changes in the substrate (steric hindrance and ring strain), and with changes in nucleophile or leaving group. Classic experiments by Kenyon and Phillips and by Bartlett and Knox established the nature of Walden inversion.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","We’re talking about nucleophilic substitution reactions. So we’re going to look at experimental tools you can use to decide what the mechanism of the reaction is. And the one we’re going to talk about first is called nucleophilic substitution, S. Substitution, nucleophilic, 2 means second order in kinetics, and you’ll see what that means. You can have association followed by dissociation, which happens, but not with carbon. Not that it couldn’t be, because you have the intermediate, and you can go either to the product or back to the starting material. Because in the first two cases the nucleophile comes on the opposite face from where the leaving group is leaving. Or it could be a DISplacement, where the nucleophile comes in on the opposite side, and the things that make it chiral are inverted. The first really good evidence on this, and a beautiful experiment, was done in England by Kenyon and Phillips in 1923. So you have to have just one step that involves the nucleophilic substitution reaction. You can’t undergo the replacement reaction easily with OH. You don’t have to attack .And once you have this product, that now is a good leaving group, because if you break the bond between carbon and oxygen, now the anion you get is not OH, but an anion analogous to the anion of sulfuric acid, OSO. That it’s + at the product and + at the starting material? And we find out that we get that product, and that’s the nucleophilic substitution at saturated carbon. But there was a reason in the experimental design they did that. So this was a very clever experimental design, and proved that inversion is the normal course, backside attack on the carbon. But there’s a lot of the ethanol there compared to how much ethoxide, especially here at the beginning when you don’t have any ethoxide at all. It depends on the concentration of ethanol. Do you have any way of measuring how reactive these two things should be? p. p. How different are they in attacking a proton. And that’s an equilibrium that’s easy to measure by the way we did last time. Here we put three methyls on that second carbon. So there’s a higher activation energy, enough to slow it by 145 fold. So the third one is what really stops it. And one that wouldn’t be complicated by other problems. He said that in 1975.This is the structure of that molecule with balls and sticks. And it became so important, this kind of structure, that people who are in the field know how to draw it quickly. If you were to get a cation, it would have to not be planar, otherwise it would be slowed down by 10 fold. But cyclobutyl is very much slower, 200 times slower. And cyclopropyl is very, very much slower than that. And it wants–it’s  hybridized to make those bonds to the original substituents. Can you see what the problem is in the six-member ring?"
175,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-8,"The nature of nucleophiles and leaving groups has strong influence on the rate of S2 reactions. Generally a good nucleophile or strong base is a poor leaving group, but hydrogen-bonding solvents can alter nucleophile reactivity. Although amino and hydroxyl groups are poor leaving groups, they may be converted to groups that leave easily, even from bridgehead positions. Designing the preparation of a sugar analogue containing radioactive fluorine shows how understanding the S2 mechanism enables PET scanning for medical imaging. Quantum mechanics suggests that the pentavalent carbon species on the S2 reaction pathway is a transition state, not a stable structure.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","So we’re studying nucleophilic substitution, in part at least, as a means of seeing how one goes about establishing a mechanism, proving a mechanism. Remember that the S2 nucleophilic substitution has a number of components here, and the logic is to vary them, see how the rate changes, and see if you can disprove some of the mechanisms. And you don’t have that factor in acetone. We saw this in the case of water, the gas phase ions, how much they were stabilized by having water come around them to the order of 100 kilocalories per mole, compared to the gas phase. If charge is being destroyed in the reaction, than a polar solvent will stabilize the starting materials more than it does the transition state, and the reaction will slow down. You can’t get at the backside, so that’s out. It’s his graduation picture from Bates College. So the higher the p, the worse it is as a leaving group, as we just saw. The next thing you need to do to get toward the product–I mean obviously this particular reaction wasn’t figured out on paper by saying what’s the HOMO and what’s the LUMO, and so on. So now we’ve done the allylic rearrangement, except it’s still got a positive charge on the nitrogen. But it’s certainly a very, very strong acid. So once you have that, remember we already got the chloride from the first reaction. N is a fabulous leaving group, and can even make the bridgehead cation. And another way is to convert it into a sulfonate ester, which is a good leaving group. So that was what Kenyon and Phillips did, remember, in order to study the inversion. So everything he wrote, he made up out of his head in there. But even in this case, I doubt that that really was the condition. Because as it turns out, the double bond between phosphorus and oxygen is quite a strong one. So they can stabilize the electrons on the adjacent oxygen when you make a negative charge there. But it’s the same mass, 18, because all you lost was this positive electron. So when the electron and a positron meet one another, they annihilate. So if you surround the thing with the detector that can tell when things hit it, when two things hit it at the same time, they came from the same nuclear decay. So you don’t have much time to make it into something that will go where the tumor is. So what you have to do is make one of them different from the others. Could changing the solvent help?Change the solvent to something that can’t make hydrogen bonds. How can we get rid of the potassium cation? Don’t atoms get bigger if you add an electron?Well, if you add an electron to the potassium cation, it’s not a cation anymore. But you can do that just by treating it with water and acid. It just goes to where glucose is being consumed."
176,chemistry,chem-125b,lecture-9,"Preliminary X-ray analysis of molecules that have been designed to favor a carbon with five bonds seemed to suggest the possibility of a pentavalent intermediate in S2 reactions, but further analysis of these structures showed just the opposite. Boron, however, can be pentavalent in such an environment.  E2, S1 and E1 mechanisms compete with the S2 reaction. Factors controlling E2 eliminations are illuminated by kinetic isotope effects, stereochemistry, and regiochemistry. The competition between E2 and S2 mechanisms influence the design of synthetic schemes, including those in which carbon nucleophiles play an important role. S1 and E1 reactions involve carbocation intermediates and thus the possibility that the carbon skeleton will rearrange.Professor McBride’s website resource for CHEM 125b (Spring 2011)","We’re going to finish up on nucleophilic substitution, S2, where we’re spending so much time looking at how you prove a mechanism. Is there some stability associated with that? Although if you want to be careful about it, not all the positive charge is on carbon because the unshared pairs on the adjacent oxygens, of course, are mixing with that vacant orbital. That’s neither here nor there, but it’s what was there in the crystal. What they are, are ellipses with an octant cut out of them to show the size of the axes. It would be elongated if it vibrated with great amplitude back and forth. The distance is shortened by 0.16 Å, as if they’re being sucked in. This was published in a distinguished journal, the. And that, you see, does push them further apart. But the central oxygen is only slightly repulsive, compared to the carbon. Then in the case where C was in the middle–they made the C that way–but it’s not such a great C because of the vacant orbital on the carbon being mixed with the unshared pairs on the adjacent oxygens. But if this makes a difference it shows that bond is being broken during the transition state. We know the leaving group is leaving, we know the base is coming in, those two things either before or at the transition state, and now we know the hydrogen is leaving at the transition state, and let’s see how that works. We saw in  that you have a vibrational potential surface. Remember, there’s a lowest possible kinetic energy, the one that gives no nodes in the wave. We saw all these different nucleophilic substitution reactions, and the question then if you’re trying to apply somebody else’s work to yours, is how general they are. You can start with methanol, treat it with sodium hydride. Here’s another interesting synthetic intermediate which is, if you start with a compound that has OH and chlorine on adjacent atoms and notice it has one in the front and one in the back. If I want to get this product, that’s something plus C-C-O. How could I do that? The new one is typically something like oxygen or nitrogen. So you need a stronger base if you want to pull off a proton and do that. We’ll see later on in the course how very important nucleophiles that are carbon are in putting molecules together. This was done with 0.01 molar sodium hydroxide getting these rates. In fact, if you looked at the second-order rate constant, which takes into account the concentration of base, then you see these fall on a nice curve and it’s slowed down by crowding, the steric hindrance that we talked about before. That rate actually wasn’t measured at that temperature. But in the case here where it’s cyanide, that’s the high HOMO, that’s doing the attacking, you find that you get not only the cyanide substitution but you also get substitution by water. You put in more cyanide; the formation of this product is faster. The rate of destroying the starting material doesn’t change when you do this."
177,classics,clcv-205,lecture-10,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan finishes up his description of the Spartan constitution. He argues that Sparta had a mixed constitution and gained great power due to alliances that the Spartans made with their neighbors. After the discussion of Sparta, Professor Kagan examines Athens and the development of the Athenian constitution. In addition, he shows how different these two were. Finally, Professor Kagan discusses the emergence of the hoplite class in Athens and the failure of Cylon to make himself tyrant of Athens.","We were examining Sparta, the most important, I think, of the early , certainly once you get into the seventh and sixth centuries. So, if the  wanted to do something, it would be damn foolish not to clear it with the  first; although if they wished to be reckless, they could do otherwise. This is not true necessarily and typically of the . Not for a specific purpose only, but a permanent coalition of states which the ancient Greeks referred to as the Spartans and their allies, which modern scholars have come to call the Peloponnesian League, and I guess I will use that term and you’ll see it all over the place. Also, there was a legend that maybe they propagated that showed up in some poetry we have, that Agamemnon had moved from his home base in Mycenae to Sparta, an attempt, in other words, to connect these Dorian Spartans with the legends of the great men of the Achaean world described by Homer. Its common people referred to Cynuria as the Alsace-Lorraine of the Peloponnesus. It’s a little bit less, or at least you want it to seem that way and to have the same friends and enemies as the Spartans had, and to follow them wherever the Spartans should lead. One, the Spartans didn’t take away their land, destroy their houses, make them slaves or anything like that. Spartan way of doing it means you gain more troops for your army. After all, one of the most important things that is involved in membership in the league, is that when the Spartans say, I want you to come and fight with me for these purposes, you come and you bring your army to do it, but we have a period in Thucydides’ account of the Peloponnesian War in which important states like Corinth and Thebes, among others, simply say “no.” All right, but by the end of the sixth century there is this Spartan alliance and Sparta alone, among the Greek states, is a hegemonal power and able to use, by Greek standards, a much vaster military force than the Greeks have ever known, so that when the Persian Wars come upon them, there will be no hesitation and no doubt; the Greek league that will fight the Persians, will be led by the Spartans. So, you can look at the Peloponnesian league in general as the way in which the Spartans dealt with the danger they felt internally and externally. War, if you win, you are going to have booty; loot of some kind will come back into Sparta. Their way of life was imposed upon them by the decision to maintain their command of the Helots, after that it all makes perfect sense. As I mentioned earlier, the utopian philosophers of the fourth century, Plato being the most striking, Aristotle to a lesser degree, they admire this, although they have their wrinkles about how it’s going to be. So let’s take a look now at Athens to see how they came along. The city is Athens; the region in which they live is Attica; the people are Athenians and that’s an important point I think I made too, which is everybody who is a citizen who lives in Attica is an Athenian, no matter if he lives sixty five or seventy miles away from the city. It is a tradition not of producing conflict but of producing harmony. Similarly, there is nothing like the helot class in Athens. The society we’re talking about, this earliest society, is aristocratic and remember it’s important to notice the difference between aristocratic and oligarchic. Everywhere you can imagine, tribe, , and so on, some aristocratic family or families would have had a leading role by tradition. If there was a quarrel between a couple of guys, they would bring it to a court. They were elected from the aristocracy by the assembly of all Athenian adult males. Yalies are very nervous about anybody sticking his head up above the crowd, because the question is always why not me? So, this guy was a young big shot of extraordinary character named, Cylon, attempted trying to establish a tyranny in Athens, just as his father-in-law had established one in Megara."
178,classics,clcv-205,lecture-11,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan traces the development of Athens. He argues that Athens, like other , undergoes political and social turmoil due to the rise of the hoplite farmer. This unrest is first seen in the attempted  of Cylon and the Law of Draco. Professor Kagan also points out that in response to these developments, Solon was made sole  of Athens to establish peace in a time of unrest. It should also be noted that Solon established laws that were moderate in nature. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that Solon was only partially successful. Eventually, a tyranny is established in Athens by Peisistratus, but Peisistratus, according to Professor Kagan, was a special type of tyrant, one that not only upheld the new laws of Solon, but was also interested in the welfare of Athens.","I think the last thing I mentioned to you was the attempted  on the part of a nobleman by the name of Cylon, who was attempting to establish a tyranny of the sort that was becoming common in the neighborhood, and that he was the son-in-law of a tyrant in next-door Megara. Now, when it is possible, at least in some realms of the law, to know what that law is that has reduced the special place that the aristocrats have in society. So, this is the first little step towards a very important development for Athens in the future. So, we’ve seen a number of signs of change moving Athens in the direction that the other Greek states were moving, which bring us in the early sixth century to the first, I think I’ve said this before but I want to say it again, to the first truly living, human being that we come across probably in all of Greek history, certainly in that of Athens, Solon, whom we think of as the great lawgiver for reasons that you’ve read about and I’ll tell you about in a moment anyway. We have to imagine it’s at least a couple of generations old in order for that to make any sense. If they had movable products or movable possessions that would have been gone. All they had left to give was the person and probably, I hate to tell you this my friends, but reality is reality, probably the first thing they did was to give their children as a surety for the loan and when the loan was not met, the children became slaves of the person who had leant them money and at some point, probably this even happened to grownups themselves, so that a sufficient number of people had been so enslaved as to create a very general problem. They wouldn’t have been able to stay alive. Well, scholars have also had a fantastic time trying to figure out how this came about, and I never found anything that seems satisfactory to me, based on looking at the sources or reading people’s interpretations until once again my hero, Victor Hanson, came down the road and he’s a farmer. However, the second element I think that put pressure on everybody, was next door in Megara when things had gone bad for the poor, there was a revolution and a tyranny was established, and so it was down the road in Corinth, and so it was a little further down the road in Scythian, so that the dominant people, the satisfied people, the people who liked things as they were, were worried that, if they didn’t solve their socio-economic problem they would find themselves confronting a tyranny. He had achieved fame, notoriety by his military activity. Greeks never stopped worshipping at the shrine of moderation for the rest of their history. So, Solon introduced the measure which is called in Greek, the. That is, they don’t solve the problems that are there, but that doesn’t mean they are not worth anything. It never abolished great bit land holding arrangements that some people had. But these people were not going to be metics, because of the economic skills that they brought. But it turned out to be one of those things that Solon instituted that would have long range consequences, helpful to the Athenian state. People with 300 measures a year, but not 500, were called meaning cavalrymen. But I think we can guess by analogy to other councils that it would have considerable power, that it would have decided many things. All this time before, every magistrate, as I believe I mentioned, had a court of his own that dealt with matters that were appropriate to his court and that was the end of it. Well, it saved him a lot of grief, but it didn’t save his legislation, because there was tremendous strife in Athens after the year of Solon’s archonship, indeed, something resembling chaos I think. We know very little about the details of that period, but he was a proper tyrant one way or another. All of that allows him to get his forces together, and sure enough, when he lands at Marathon, that’s his home territory and all his people come rallying round to him and now he has a good sized army of Athenians and mercenaries and he marches inland, and in the middle land of Attica, the place called Pellini, he meets his opponents and defeats them in battle, and makes himself the tyrant of Athens once again. In fact, later writers describe the way he ruled Athens, and it’s this last period that they’re talking about I think, as one that was , meaning moderately and in accordance with the way a  should be run, which does not include tyranny. Of course, he had this quarrel with Megacles, so that was not a surprise and they could not readily be made complacent to what was going on, although we do have, and this is remarkable, we have an actual inscription which is blatantly a list of  who held office in Athens after Peisistratus’ death, in the period when his sons ruled Athens. But it was also, of course, in his interest. Nothing Solon did directly affected that situation, but when we get into the fifth century, the evidence is overwhelming that we have what I spoke of earlier, lots and lots of medium, moderate family-sized farms, some big farms, but these are not what are characteristic of the place. That is, he would give money or lend money to farmers who needed it when they needed it, which was of course one of the issues constantly before the small farmers of Attica. It shows up in a Byzantine encyclopedia; that story is still being told."
179,classics,clcv-205,lecture-12,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan examines in detail the development, growing pains, and emergence of Athenian democracy. He argues that the tyranny under the Peisistratids led to the development of the idea of self-government among the Athenians, which Cleisthenes used to develop Athens in a more democratic direction. One of the ways Cleisthenes was able to accomplish this was to diminish the power of the aristocracy by reordering and restructuring the tribes and giving greater power to the assembly. Finally, Professor Kagan says a word on the Athenian practice of ostracism as a political tool to protect a fledgling democracy.","Peisistratus died in 527 with all his power, insofar as we know peacefully, and was succeeded in the tyranny over Athens by his sons, by first wife, Hippeis who was the elder and Hipparchus. The story, as Herodotus tells it, is that their goal was to drive out Hippeis from Athens and the way to do it this time — you remember they’ve tried every trick in the world, and it hasn’t really worked. But I’ll come back to that story in just a moment. Another consequence of the tyrannical experience in Athens was a diminution in the power of the aristocracy, and this again is the general story wherever we see tyranny in the Greek world. Solon had intervened in an important way and the tyrants had made their contribution too, to changes that turned out to be permanent. Not a whole range, there are a few possibilities. They’re not going to enjoy being put back to a position which was worse than they had under the tyranny. That was really what the contest was, I think. He went out there beyond the aristocratic circle and he recruited people. So, Cleomenes comes back with his forces and drives Cleisthenes, and we are told — this is interesting figure and I can’t promise that it’s right, but it does show up in Herodotus. If you don’t know that, the French regularly expect that the kings and emperors of Europe will be marching against them with professional armies very soon, and their fear is absolutely justified, and so is the Athenian fear that the Spartans will be coming. Hell no, because as we will see, one of his main planks is enrolling those people as citizens. So, in fact, I will bet a lot of money that in all the electioneering that went on about all these different things, they were a group he must have targeted and said you’ve been unfairly treated by these aristocrats. So, you have a cave of Pan in eastern Attica, and you have a place where Athena did this, that, and the other thing, and the point I’m getting at is these became shrines, places where the religion was exercised in ancient Attica, aristocratic Attica. That is, the , and the notion of the as the core of such things, was never abolished; it would have been out of the question to abolish it. Cleisthenes tried with the law, to change the way in which an Athenian was officially designated. He was trying to copy his ancestor Cleisthenes of Sicyon, who also changed the tribes, you may remember in Sicyon, from the old Dorian tribes to new tribes that designated the wrong people like — I mean to say the Dorians as swine men and ass men, and so on. The procedure, we all agree, is by the device that the Greeks called . The  is the servant of the assembly, without question. But I think that’s to be deliberately blind to what’s really happening. But the chances are great that they did not call it democracy. He could get up in the center, that was the term they used, of the town, meaning wherever the meeting place was, and then speak his mind and also try to persuade his fellow citizens to do as he thought best. But supposing a majority had voted for an ostracism, now we go to roughly the month of March and let’s go down to the center of town, the , which is the marketplace, which is the political center which is where people go to talk and all those things. Here’s another piece of information; that’s not a tale. The best guess of everybody who studies these things is that we do not have here the remains of a collection of voters, who voted and had their votes counted and then these came, but rather that these were votes that never were cast actually. I should tell you one other thing, that Thucydides himself says something very important about this. Plutarch, as I say, has a more general story, the envy and jealousy natural to democracy. But Thucydides was there, while ostracism was a reality, as opposed to Plutarch, and I’m sure he is right. In fact, there are still relatives of the tyrants, eminent ones, who are still in Athens. I knew that would never be in your mind, but I tell you what you ought to do, why don’t you come over to my side and I’ll see to it — you know I have friends, I got a lot of friends. Most years there was no ostracism, only once in a while, and every single person that we hear ostracized was a leading political figure. You could only use it as a politician if you were the popular favorite."
180,classics,clcv-205,lecture-13,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan traces the development and the power of the Persian empire. He also shows how the Persian empire and the Greek world eventually came into conflict through a few incidents concerning Ionian Greeks in Asia Minor, which eventually turned into the Persian Wars. Professor Kagan ends this lecture with a description of the events of the battle of Marathon in which the Athenians defeated the Persians.","The period in which the Greek  were left essentially to their own devices came to an end with the clash between the Persian Empire and some of the Greek city states, but which came to involve Athens at the famous Battle of Marathon in 490, and I’d like to tell you today about the rise of the Persian Empire, and its conflict with the Greeks, and concluding with the account of that battle. They are still Athenian citizens; they are really functioning as an Athenian garrison to see to it that things in Boeotia are okay. Hippeis has also fled to the Persians and is protected by the king, so that, if the Persians get involved, they too will want to put Hippeis on the throne in Athens, but the Spartans want to do the same thing, and again the Corinthians will have none of that because of their attitude towards tyranny. That’s the city where the rebellion starts. He has talked the great king into an expedition that he wanted to launch against the island of Naxos in the Aegean Sea. So, they rebel against the tyrants who have been collaborating with the great king and this is an interesting point. So all of that makes me think that it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that it’s Athenian democracy that is the model for these rebellious Ionian states. They are led to that by knowing that later in the fifth century the Athenians will end up having 400 triremes, but that’s many years later, that’s after a victory over the Persians. Why did they do it?Well, for all the reasons I’ve suggested, they care about the Ionians. A few Eretrians, twenty ships of Athenians accomplish this deed of doing considerable harm to the great king’s position there in Lydia. They were numerically superior and they were very good sailors and horsemen. So, the Athenians had every reason to fear an invasion or some sort of attack from the Persians in the future. It is interesting, I think, that in the year 496-5, which is to say before the battle of Lade, while the rebellion is still on, the man who is elected the eponymous  for that year is Hipparchus, the son of Karmas, a relative of the Peisistratids, and he is precisely the man, who tradition says the first ostracism was allegedly aimed at. The Persians have conquered most of the known world as far as the Greeks are concerned. I’m sure there must have been Athenians, and Herodotus says there were, who would have preferred accepting Hippeis back as tyrant and having the Persians be the real rulers of their land, rather than all getting killed, when the Persians decided to come after them. He has concluded for varieties of reasons, that Athens must have a much larger navy than she already has, and he also is obviously a member of that faction that thinks the Persians will be coming and that wishes to be ready, and is eager to fight against the Persians. They decide we’re not going to be swept away with the Athenians when the Persians get here, and they give earth and water to the king. The estimate that most people would accept is somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 infantrymen. So, that force starts this time, not along the coast, as I told you last time. They treat the Delians and the priests of Apollo at Delos with great respect, do them no harm; this is typical Persian conquests. They then turn to the southern tip of the island of Euboea, to the town of Carystus; the Persians may be not at war with the Greeks but they expect all Greeks who are along the way to behave the way they’re supposed too to the great king, and so they asked the Carystians to give earth and water, the Carystians refuse and the Persians obliterate their city, and take their people into slavery. I can’t go speculating as to what are we to make of this. I mean, he is a general, but that’s not the only reason; it’s because everybody knows Miltiades is the resident Persian expert. He has been a general in the Persian army, and so that gives him a reason to be listened to, but he’s obviously also a person of great merit and quality, and proves it at the Battle of Marathon. So, the modern terminology I would use to explain what the Athenian strategy was to go out and to contain the beachhead, go out confront the Persians where they are, don’t let them get inland from where they land. The Greeks have the upper hill, the Persians are down below. The Persians did break through the center but they were too late. The Athenians won the battle, very large casualties for the Persians. Only 192 Greeks killed in the battle and allowed the extraordinary honor of being buried on the field where they fought. So I’ve described very inadequately and too swiftly the battle."
181,classics,clcv-205,lecture-14,"In this lecture, Professor Donald Kagan examines the developments that took place after the Greek victory over the Persians in 479 BC. He argues that even after the Greek victories, there was great fear amongst the Greeks that the Persians would return to seek revenge. For this reason, many of the Greek , especially the islands, looked to Athens to lead this league, which later became the Delian League. Athens, according to Professor Kagan, accepted this responsibility, since it too feared a Persian invasion, but Sparta was content to retreat into the Peloponesus. Finally, Professor Kagan intimates that this league would eventually turn into the Athenian empire.","The Persians were busy with other things as well as thinking about returning to Greece because the great king was not willing, and understandably in a way, to accept his defeat by these few puny Greeks, because of the consequences that would have for the reputation of Persia, and just as a matter of personal honor these kings would not have been glad to accept such an outcome. So, it’s almost a contemporary event and you can see that from the first the Greeks viewed this war as being about freedom as opposed to many other possible considerations. On the land, the battle of Plataea in southern Boeotia, in which a great Greek army, which included the major cities including especially Sparta and Athens took on a powerful Persian land army and defeated them on land. So, there is a conference, but there is not a unity of intention. Moreover, as we’ve seen and said several times, they had very important supply line, lines of communication and transportation, in order to feed themselves they needed to go out there and have freedom of the seas, and that meant that they had to see to it that the Persians were indeed driven from the Aegean Sea and the Hellespont and the straits in general, and the access to the Black Sea. But most strikingly, I think we have to understand that the Athenians understood the Persians have to be kept away from the Aegean Sea and the Athenians also wanted very much, because ever since the rebellion of 499, the Athenians had wanted to liberate the Greeks of Asia Minor from the Persian rule. So, he made the suggestion that the silver strike be used to build a whole fleet of new ships for the Athenians, and they end up with two hundred triremes, which is, the trireme is the battleship of the ancient Greeks. It’s the sort of the thing that I feel some familiarity with. One of them, who is to be the leader if there is to be a leader of the Greeks, but beyond that there was some Greek states that had gone over to the Persians in the course of the war. The Greeks refer to these people as Medizers. So, that tells us that until then they felt themselves still to be part of that Greek League. Of course, everything would have to be done by the common consent. You know, I know it’s your own business but we don’t think that’s a good idea, because if the Persians come again they could use your walled city as a base against us. Indeed, for the rest of his life the Spartans will be trying to do him harm and remove him from the scene, but he certainly achieves what he wants. I’m sure it’s much more complicated than we know, but in the simplest way there were some Spartans who were content to withdraw back to the Peloponnesus to have nothing to do with the world outside the Peloponnesus, much less with the world of the Aegean Sea and beyond, and try to return to their traditional ways, a peace faction if you will, a conservative faction perhaps. In addition, he became very much caught up in the great wealth and luxury that the Persians demonstrated. All of these things, as I say, irritated their fellow Greeks who began to bring charges against him. Later on further charges would be brought against him and he would indeed be put to death. Thucydides says this about the Spartan decision. That’s because we shouldn’t be out there. This is like the Greek League; this is a perpetual alliance. The membership of the league, as best we can figure it out — this is not a hundred percent accurate but it’s not bad. This is not in any shape, manner, or form connected with the Peloponnesian League. It just simply means, in the most neutral sense, contribution. It was enormously efficient because you had a leader who was designated and interested, and deeply involved. Well clearly, all the states of the league had a lot to lose from allowing pirates to roam freely in their waters, and so Cimon crushed the Skirian pirates and he drove them from the island, and he made sure that the island would be secure by putting in an Athenian . This is the same kind of arrangement; Athenians of military age who permanently settle in Skiros, but retain their Athenian citizenship; they are a garrison in effect to protect the island of Skyros from falling into bad hands in the future. That was not the view taken by the Athenians, or I guess, by most of the allies, but we can imagine that there were some of the allies, who were restless in their need to continue to make contributions to the league when they didn’t feel that there was any purpose to the league anymore."
182,classics,clcv-205,lecture-15,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan describes the mechanics of the Delian League and its transformation into the Athenian empire. This transformation caused Athens to rival Sparta as an equal in power and prestige. He also argues that this process took place rather smoothly due to the good relations between Sparta and Athens. Professor Kagan argues that Cimon the Athenian generally played an important part in this development. Finally, Professor Kagan begins to describe the workings of Athenian democracy by comparing it with modern American democracy.","Okay, we were talking about the development of the Athenian Empire changing from the original character of the Delian League. When the Thasians were finally forced to surrender, the Athenians gave them the usual treatment to rebellious states. Well, that wasn’t the first time such a thing had happened to one of the members of the league, but what made it different was that the quarrel was not over anything that had to do with the league. After all, there was no way that the league benefited from having either Athens or Thasos exploit those mines. That is a good place for us to look at the evaluation that the ancient writers made of this transition. Looking ahead that’s what will happen, that’s will be the end of the Delian League, it will be the Athenian empire in every respect. There was right after the Persian War, as I said a few words about it before, a rising competition for a place of standing in the Greek world. But these things don’t always happen that way. Amazingly enough, when we take a look at the early actions of the Delian League, and which in every case, you remember, the commander of every expedition is an Athenian, it’s never Themistocles whom you would have imagined would have been leading all these expeditions. His pro-Spartan foreign policy I think is a very critical part of the tale, and I think things would have been very, very different, if Themistocles had been the dominant politician, because it was clear that from what he’d already done and what he will do later that he was anti-Spartan and urging Athenian independence from Sparta and really hostility between the two sides. Now, the poor had no wherewithal to keep themselves alive when they went into exile in this way, and so the Areopagites used their own money to keep the poor alive and in good condition during that period of time. The war extends for a long time; there’s no success. You’ve heard of that once or twice, and they said, well, the reason he hadn’t won the war so quickly was because had been bribed by the King of Macedonia, which is right behind the territory we’re talking about; not to conquer Macedonia. Cimon has not lost his support and the case is absurd. The earthquake was so serious as to disrupt life in Sparta and in Spartan territory in general, and thereby to encourage a great helot rebellion, so that the latter even after the earthquake was over, was what occupied and terrified the Spartans, and it was serious enough that they sent out to their allies, and I’m not now talking merely about their allies in the Peloponnesian League, in their allies who had joined them in the Greek League against Persia, which was still on the books, asking them to send help against the helots, and a number of them did. He seems to have evidence about what was said at this debate in the assembly, and Ephialtes is supposed to have said something like the arrogance of Sparta must be trampled underfoot and he lost the argument. He was murdered; somebody came and stuck a knife in him. When you think of how few were the methods for protecting anybody in the Athenian state, it really is a remarkable thing. Many people today would insist that to qualify as a democracy, a state must offer full constitutional and political protections and opportunities to all who have legal permanent residence within its borders and who desire citizenship. To look at it from the other end, the Athenians would have been astonished at the claim of modern states to that title, even such states as the United States and Great Britain. They circle the agora, and they kept closing the circle until everybody was out. Policy would be discussed in a small closed group and the decision made by one man ultimately, the President of the United States. If there were no leaks, a big if, people would hear of it only when the die had been cast. The chief elected officials were ten generals, voted for a one year term. That’s what’s behind all of this careful check on the generals."
183,classics,clcv-205,lecture-16,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan continues to discuss the constitution of Athens. In particular, he explores the judicial workings of Athens. He describes in detail the effort of the Athenians to create a system of justice that would not only minimize tampering, in order to insure justice, but also maximize citizen participation. After this discussion, Professor Kagan comments on the role of women in Athens by looking at two types of sources. The picture that emerges is considerably complex and left without resolution. Finally, he comments on the role of slaves. In each of these discussions, he draws illuminating analogies to our modern society.","I was trying to describe to you how the Athenian democracy in its full form, after the reforms that were instituted by Pericles, after the death of Ephialtes, how that system worked and I had described what we would call the legislative branch and the much less significant executive branch, and now I’d like to turn to what we would call the judicial branch. So, in fundamental matters of justice and fairness, the Athenian democrat put very little faith in experts. This was Lysias, who lived at the end of the fifth century and into the fourth, and he was one of the great successful speech writers in Athens. Sometimes the plaintiff has died before his case gets to court. Now in fact the Athenians did appreciate the importance of knowledge, skill, talent, and experience, when they thought these things existed and could be used in the public interest. If they did not elect professors of political science or philosophers, or lawyers to govern and judge them, it was because they were skeptical that there is a useful expertise in these areas, and that if it did exist it could safely and profitably be employed for the public good. It is not clear, to me anyway, that the experience of the last twenty five hundred years has shown them to be wrong. Well the Athenians would never permit anything so undemocratic as that. Secondly, it is most unlikely that many fools or incompetents played a significant part in public affairs. But to get at how the Athenians coped with this problem the assembly itself was a far less unwieldy or incompetent body than is generally assumed by its critics and that you might ordinarily think would be the case if you’ve got five or six thousand people out there trying to make a decision. Apart from that, every year five hundred Athenians served on the council, where everyday they gained experience in the management of Athens affairs from the most trivial to the most serious, producing bills that served as the basis for the debates and votes of the assembly. To begin with I would suggest another analogy for you. They thought something else, they thought they were creating a popular republic, and by republic they meant something different from democracy. The first resulted from ain the midst of a long and difficult war. They could, if they had wanted to, they could have abolished debt which presumably would be something the poor would favor. The poorest, moreover, those who lacked the property to quality as infantrymen, were the very men who rode the ships that brought Athens wealth and power and glory. I think we ought to also study them with a certain humility. There, of course, should be no slaves, but now we’re moving towards saying that people should receive citizenship or citizen rights who aren’t even legally citizens. A father at first, a husband later, or failing these, an appropriate male relative designated by the law. He said, “your great glory is not to fall short of your natural character and the greatest glory of women is to be least talked about by men, whether for good or ill.” The picture derived from these sources is largely accurate, but I would argue that it does not fit in well with what we learn from the evidence of a wholly different set of sources. In Greece, chattel slavery proper began to increase about five hundred B.C. and it remained an important element in society. I think, as I said earlier, I think probably most of the hoplites could manage that but I think we really don’t know the answer to that. That was not the typical way for the Greeks, but rather the wealthy would have several smaller farms scattered about the polis. Most manufacturing, however, was at very small scale with shops using one or two, or a handful of slaves. You would have two or three guys working there. I find several problems with this analogy. So, the whole way of thinking about it I think was so different that — and here’s another thing, we never hear of a slave rebellion among the polis of Athens. I’ve told this story to various American lawyers and law professors, and I’ve been struck by their absolute lack of imagination, but when I finally get them to think about these things they tell me that some of them tell me very happily that in some areas we are moving towards that or we have some of that. But mostly if I speak to, especially law professors, I’ve tried to get them to think about the advantages and disadvantages of the Athenian system with some objectivity, and I say to them put aside for the moment the question of whether you think justice is more likely to be arrived at through the Anglo-Saxon system of law or the Athenian system of law, because the truth is we don’t know one way or the other, and I found that they can’t do it."
184,classics,clcv-205,lecture-17,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan describes the events that lead up the Peloponnesian War. He argues that the rise of Athenian power and the concomitant challenge to Spartan dominance pointed to potential conflict. However, Professor Kagan also points out that there were many people who did not want war and that therefore war was not inevitable. The Thirty Years Peace was negotiated, and Professor Kagan finally argues that its clause for arbitration was the key clause that could have prevented war.","For the next couple of weeks we will be examining the coming and the fighting of the Great Peloponnesian War. It is actually to Thucydides that that way of thinking about things is old. General Marshall referred to it in a famous quotation when he was Secretary of State and people keep talking about it, and so the curiosity I think rather than the familiarity — curiosity about what is this all about may account for this, but it’s also true that if you go to — Thucydides and the Peloponnesian War are taught in all the military academies. There’s nothing more typical of human societies than that they are organized to fight wars and do so. Everything I’ve said is open to criticism and disagreement, and just naturally great big arguments about these things, but I’m giving you my view which is not original or unique. The Athenians had allied themselves with Spartan enemies; the Athenians had taken the halots and put them in this terrific place. Sometimes it is an apt thing, and sometimes it is not. This time it is, as we shall see; it didn’t take very much to produce an explosion between Athens and Sparta after these events. Now, one natural reaction would be this, it seems to me. And as we know the Athenians do not produce enough food to feed themselves. So, I agree with Thucydides, if you’re talking about the First Peloponnesian War, but that’s not what he’s talking about. We need not say very much about the war in detail. It’s a kind of an ape man pounding on his chest to show how great he was. So, they obviously had friendly relations with the Spartans. I’m not sure, if the Spartans would have done so in the normal course of events, because it does mean that they have to get up to central Greece. So, they told the Spartans that if they would come and assist them in gaining control of Boeotia, the Boeotians would join them in an attack on Athens, and so I think it was that that made it possible for the Spartans to agree and to act. This is a very big battle by Greek standards and the result is almost a standoff. As one sees from what happens after that, it really looks more like a strategic victory for the Athenians, because now A) they have not been destroyed, they have not been defeated in any useful way, they have not been stopped in what they were doing and to prove it the Athenians take an army northward when the Spartans have withdrawn into Boeotia, defeat the Boeotian army at a place called Oenophyta, and the next thing you know, establish democratic governments in all the Boeotian cities which are friendly to Athens. Now the Athenians institute a new policy, and I think whatever you think about anything before this, when the Athenians do what I’m about to describe, they surely have made this an empire, no longer anything like a voluntary confederacy, because they take one sixtieth of what is put into the treasury every year as a donation to Athena, which is another way of saying to Athens. So, he takes a fleet and sails to Cyprus, part of which is in Persian hands, fights a battle against the Persians, defeats the Persians, but has the bad fortune to be killed. In 449, two years after the truce was negotiated, we find Sparta attacking the city of Phocis, the  of Phocis, again up in central Greece. On the island of Euboea to the east of Attica, there is a rebellion. It’s not just that he can’t have Euboea be independent; he cannot let rebels in your empire succeed because it encourages other rebellions, and they’ve just been through that. On the other hand that’s now — they’ve been put down. You’ll have taken casualties for nothing and you still won’t be able to compel us to do what you want. I think it shows you that this was an argument that had some reality and had some appeal. Finally, the most remarkable, and I believe original, absolutely original idea of its kind ever. That is, there are peaces and there are peaces. At the other extreme is where, I suppose, the winning side can impose a harsh peace, but chooses to impose a gentle peace in the hope that in the future they will have friendly relations with the other side, and so they trust the other side, even though it’s not destroyed, to be good. Pericles, I think, will prove that by the time we get a chance to examine his behavior in 431, but I think it was the peace party, and there are parties in Sparta as I’ve told you before, that group of people who typically was conservative and reluctant to risk what they had already for what they might gain in future warfare, and I believe that they were the normal party in Sparta, and this is all debatable, but I think that that’s the normal situation in Sparta."
185,classics,clcv-205,lecture-18,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan describes the aftermath of the Thirty Years Peace. He argues that the Peace had the potential to keep peace between Athens and Sparta due to the arbitration clause. In addition, he argues that during this time, Athens sends various diplomatic messages to the wider Greek world stating their intentions for peace, such as the Panhellenic venture to establish Thurii. However, this peace is seriously challenged when Corinth and Corcyra come into conflict over Epidamnus. At this point, Athens could make an alliance with Corcyra and run the risk of angering Sparta or allow Corinth to potentially take over Corcyra’s navy and change the naval balance of power. Athens decides on a defensive alliance.","The oaths establishing the thirty-years peace was sworn in the year 445. Was there really a Peace of Callias or not? Even in ancient times, some writers question whether this was a historical fact. Now, about the same time — the traditional date for Peace of Callias is 449, and about the same time, we are told only by Plutarch, so some scholars have questioned the historicity of this too, that Pericles called for a great Pan Hellenic Congress to discuss a variety of questions, but one of them was how shall we keep the promises we made after the Persian War to rebuild the temples to the gods that had been destroyed by the Persians in that war, and how shall we see to the freedom of the seas? Herodotus, a good friend of Pericles, who also of course was the father of history went out there presumably to be the historian of the new city. My view is that Pericles was attempting to make a very significant point here. All we have to do — well, first of all what I’ve done already is to look at the internal character of the state and you want to argue, that is not the way to start an imperial venture in the west, set up a colony that’s not your colony, and that has only got a tenth of its population being Athenian, but other evidence I think makes it all the clearer. So, here you have a Spartan colony fighting against a Thurii, whatever that is. Now, this presents a very special problem for the Athenians when you think about it. On the one hand, the Athenians hardly want to get into a fight with Samos, an island of great power and importance with whom they have been associated for a very long time. The hostages would help make that secure. The first would be a very, very serious problem indeed. As we shall see, the Corinthians starting in 433 at least began agitating for war, and their agitation, I will argue, played a critical role in bringing the Spartans to fight. That leads me to believe that peace was possible, and I would argue still further that having passed this great crisis, having passed this test, chances of peace were better than ever, because the two sides had acquired reason to trust the other, to behave by the rules as they had been established. I think that the Spartans in 440 were in the same position they were in, or I will argue they were in at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, divided, uncertain. What it is is a consolidation of what they already have, and there’s no evidence that these actions that I’m talking about frighten the Spartans or upset them, and that’s worth a lot, because we hear plenty of complaints about what the Athenians are doing in the final crisis, but nobody makes any reference to these events that some scholars think show Athenian growth. So, there we are; again, a crisis has been overcome. It was an important road system that they had, but in Greek times it was out nowhere is what I’m trying to suggest to you. There’s no evidence they care about which side wins; they see no point in getting involved themselves. It was not a part of the Peloponnesian confederation. What do you do if you go to mother and you ask her, “can I have the keys to the car,” or whatever it is you need and she says, “no, you go to grandma,” you know what grandma will say, right? Relationships, if you this state on your side it will give the balance of power to you and so on, but the truth of the matter is Epidamnus is essentially irrelevant to the ordinary struggles of power between these two states, Corinth and Corcyra. If I say to you, he dissed me; do you know what I mean? This is why Thucydides is so superior to modern political scientists studying international relations. So, that I think is what is happening and when it becomes clear to Corcyra that Corinth is involved, that they are looking for a fight, and that they have dishonored Corcyra by taking over one of their colonies, the Corcyraeans are on the one hand angered, but on the other hand they’re frightened because Corinth is a great powerful state, and more important than that, Corinth is one of the most significant allies of Sparta. They say you want peace; this is what you got to do. You have got to withdraw your forces from the city; here you are besieging the city, because the Corcyraeans have come with their fleet, they have defeated — I always get this so backwards, let me see if I’ve got this right. The Corinthians are not bluffed, if it was really a bluff and on they go. It says in black letter law; it says you may take a neutral if a neutral asks you for an alliance. So, that’s what the Athenians confront when they have to make their decision. It was something they were not willing to do, but it was a very hard call, and we are told that they argued so long that it got dark before the decision could be made."
186,classics,clcv-205,lecture-19,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan focuses on the causes of the Peloponnesian War and the possible motivations for Thucydides’ book, . Concerning the first point, Professor Kagan parts ways with Thucydides and argues that the war was not inevitable and that the Athenians under Pericles followed a policy of deterrence, which was aimed at peace. Similarly, he points out that there were a number of Spartans who did not want war as well. Therefore, according to this line of reasoning, war broke out due to a number of factors that were avoidable. Concerning the second point, Professor Kagan argues that Thucydides was a revisionist historian. In other words, Thucydides was writing not as a disinterested historian, but as a historian with a point to make, namely, that the war was inevitable and that Athens was only a democracy in name under Pericles. Finally, Professor Kagan acknowledges that his two points are debatable.","If the Pericles I have in my mind has anything to do with the real Pericles who existed, he is a man who is very sophisticated about the idea of sending diplomatic signals by action, rather than merely by words, and that his intention here was to avoid the unacceptable change in the balance of naval power, which would have occurred if the Corcyraeans had been defeated by the Corinthians. So, it would have been a difficult call and I do think that Pericles anticipated that there might be an engagement, which he would want to regret, but he could blame Lacedaemonius and the generals for doing it. Remember when I was talking about colonies and the varieties of relations with the mother city that they had, I told you that Potidaea had unusually close relations with Corinth. I’m being extremely technical and careful about this. The Spartans accompanied them to that conference and clearly that means they wanted such a conference to take place, and they would have liked a peaceful outcome, but the Corinthians wouldn’t have any, and so I think that it was the clear signal that the Spartans gave that we want you to cool this that explains why fewer Peloponnesian allies showed up to help at the second battle, but among those few were the Megarians. Why?Because we know the Megarians had a terrific grudge against the Athenians, of course, throughout all of history but more to the point, at the end of the first Peloponnesian War when the Megarians had rebelled against the Athenians in their moment of greatest danger and then had slaughtered as they had an Athenian garrison at the port, there was tremendous ill will between the two cities, and the Megarians were just going to take a shot at giving the Athenians a hard time. They could march into Megara and fight, but of course, that would be an attack directly on an important ally of Sparta; it would be a breach of the thirty-years peace and it would bring about the great Peloponnesian War. No sense worrying about the details at any particular moment. The Athenians sent ambassadors to Sparta. They were there, says Thucydides, mysteriously on other business. Was it an exchange for violinists and piano players? The instructions were: go to that meeting, listen. If you think that it’s important to do so, I want you to make the following set of statements to the Spartans and so we have a speech delivered by the Athenians after all the other allies had complained about this, that, and the other thing and the essence of the Athenian speech, I think, was first of all, they did what they could to make a case for themselves, but the heart and soul of what they said was this. In effect they were suggesting what was true; we are a different kind of a state. Don’t think you’re going to win this war or that it’s going to be quick and easy. There’s no guarantee of that one way or the other. But the other side of the Athenian argument is very important too. That he had to do I think because he recognized that the speech of the Corinthians had changed the mood in Sparta, and he thought that if the Spartans simply voted on the question of war now, they would vote for it. I’m just a simple Spartan is what he’s implying, unlike these con men, unlike these sophist that you’ve been listening to. I think what happened was that the heat that had been stoked up by the Corinthian argument and those of their allies — we only have the Corinthian speech, but you can bet the Megarians and the Potidaeans laid on a pretty hot set of complaints as well, so did the Island of Aegina. In fact, if you will only withdraw the Megarian Decree there will be no war. If you want peace you must free the Greeks. Well, they might have tried to withdraw from the league and their own withdrawal would not have been critical, only if they had been able to bring with them other states. It seems to me all Greeks would have had the same doubts; they didn’t have the imagination to think that anybody would do what Pericles had in mind. So, Pericles and the Athenians, I think, went wrong as the Spartans did really in anticipating what was going to happen, and finally, I would make this point. Never again were the Greeks masters of their fate and that war was his subject. A few writers, most notably A.J.P. Taylor tried to revise the common opinion that held Hitler responsible for the Second World War, and had great success for a while. Then, when the Megarians were slowly starving, they begged the Spartans to get the law of the three harlots withdrawn. Pericles had no armed forces available to him; he could not enforce anything by pulling out some soldiers to do anything that he wanted to do. And in my view, his history is his answer to those questions."
187,classics,clcv-205,lecture-1,"Professor Donald Kagan explains why people should study the ancient Greeks. He argues that the Greeks are worthy of our study not only because of their vast achievements and contributions to Western civilization (such as in the fields of science, law, and politics) but also because they offer a unique perspective on humanity. To the Greeks, man was both simultaneously capable of the greatest achievements and the worst crimes; he was both great and important, but also mortal and fallible. He was a tragic figure, powerful but limited. Therefore, by studying the Greeks, one gains insight into a tension that has gripped and shaped the West and the rest of the world through its influence. In short, to study the Greeks is to study the nature of human experience.","That is to say, why should you, we, all of us, want to study these ancient Greeks? It emerged from a unique history in which chance and accident often played a vital part. Outside the West, republics have been unknown. Inscribed at Apollo’s temple at Delphi, which became–well, the Greeks came to call it the navel of the universe, but it certainly became the center of the Greek world — and which was also seen as a central place of importance by non-Greeks who were on the borders of the Greek world. Now, the second great strand in the history of the West is the Judeo Christian tradition, a very different tradition from the one I have just described. Here we have arrived at a second sharp break with the general experience of mankind. Into some of that space, towns and cities reappeared and with them new supports for freedom. If both religion and reason are removed, all that remains is will and power, where the only law is the law of tooth and claw. Yet, to me, it seems ironic that they have gained so much currency in a time, more or less, in which the achievements of Western reason in the form of science and at a moment when its concept of political freedom seemed to be more popular and more desirable to people in and out of Western civilization than ever. Man is potent and important, yet he is fallible and mortal, capable of the greatest achievements and the worst crimes. To me that seems an accurate description of the human condition that is meaningful, not only for the Greeks and their heirs in the West, but for all human beings. It is an understanding that cannot be achieved without a serious examination of the Western experience. These are the reasons why I examined their experience and I trust why you are thinking about learning about it."
188,classics,clcv-205,lecture-20,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan examines Pericles as a general. First, he describes Pericles’ strategy of war and then he evaluates this strategy. According to Professor Kagan, Pericles’ strategy was characterized by being both defensive and rational. It was defensive, because the Athenians did not engage the Spartans in a traditional hoplite battle, and it was rational, because Pericles assumed that the Spartans would cease fighting when they realized that the Athenians did not have to fight a land battle, since they had a walled city and a navy. On its surface, this strategy seems reasonable, but Professor Kagan points out that there were two flaws. First, the Athenians did not have an offensive plan: that is, a plan to deter the Spartans from quitting the war. Second, Pericles failed to realize that war is not always rational.","Why aren’t you all home like the rest of the class? So, if you like when I’m through I’d be glad to respond to any questions or comments that you want to make about the Peloponnesian War. So, it’s useful for us to remember that the office to which the people elected him almost every year for some thirty years, from which he carried on all of these activities, was that of , a general and that foremost responsibility of Athenian generals was to lead armies and navies into battle. In the next year, after another invasion and destruction of their crops and farms, and after a terrible plague had struck the city, again, Thucydides says they blamed Pericles for persuading them to go to war and they held him responsible for their misfortunes. Above all, he lacked the recklessness which is often needed to lead what has begun to the goal. Obviously, answering later criticism, Plutarch concludes his account of these events by saying that Pericles returned to Athens, and now I quote him, “Having showed himself to be formidable to the enemy but a safe and effective commander to his fellow citizens, for no misfortune struck the men on the expedition. In 446, when Boeotia was in rebellion, the bold and ambitious General Tolmides convinced the assembly to send him at the head of an army to put down the uprising. But to Pericles, it appeared terrible to fight a battle against 60,000 Peloponnesian and Boeotian hoplites, for that was the number of those who made the first invasion. He always said to his fellow citizens that as far as it was in his power, they would live forever and be immortals. His strategic goals, therefore, were entirely defensive. For this unprecedented strategy ran directly across the grain, as you know, of Greek tradition. Such a strategy is sometimes adopted by or forced upon the weaker side in a conflict, because no other choice promises success. In the twentieth century, the North Vietnamese communists used it with success against the United States. Their ultimate aim was to defeat the enemy in standard battles, which finally they did in Italy, Spain, and Africa. The element of chance, the unexpected and incalculable intervened against Pericles and against Athens in the form of the terrible plague that ultimately killed a third of the Athenian population. Thucydides reports that the Spartans suffered what I think of as pretty much a nervous breakdown. In other words, whatever victories the Athenians won, however great, they were always disappointed, because they had expected more than that. To convince the Spartans and their allies that victory was impossible, that the Athenians could easily sustain the only damage the enemy could inflict, the ravishing of Attica, and to show to them and the allies that the Athenians could do them considerable harm, if they chose. To deter a war in such circumstances, which is what Pericles was trying to do, requires some offensive threat to the Peloponnesians, whose menace was great and impossible to underestimate, that would make the fear of immediate consequences of war stronger than all the emotions leading to war, but Pericles had come to think of Athens as an invulnerable island since the acquisition of a fleet, a vast treasury to support it, and defensible walls. These three tendencies are like three different codes of law, deep rooted in their subject and yet variable in their relationship to one another. So, it may have persuaded Pericles that the Athenian people would find it hard, but on balance I really think not. Very unusual thing in the ancient world for anybody in ancient Athens for anybody to have that kind of a carry-over effect, but we see there’s always several generals that we know are friends of Pericles, and I think the rest of the story is that you see the generals don’t get to decide what they do in ancient Athens. The heart of the question is, “was Pericles wise to adopt a strategy no matter how good a strategy it might have been, which he knew the Athenians didn’t like,” and I think the answer — well, the outcome is obvious. No, he wasn’t wise, but that’s I think more because the strategy was faulty, not so much because the Athenians didn’t like it. They give Pericles credit for being a great general, but they say bad things about Nicias, who was involved in the great defeat in Sicily and yet, Nicias pursued something like the strategy of Pericles, which was avoiding these conflicts. I think the first thing I want to point out is that Thucydides didn’t do that."
189,classics,clcv-205,lecture-21,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan describes the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War and how the Spartans began to dominate other Greek , instead of liberating them. The Spartan general Lysander at this point not only grows in influence and power, but also follows an aggressive plan to establish pro-Spartan, oligarchical governments. However, according to Professor Kagan, this fact angered many cities. Therefore, Thrasybulus, along with the help of other , resisted Spartan rule. Eventually he opposed Sparta at Phyle and in time reestablished the democracy of Athens.","I wanted to let you realize that the Peloponnesian War is over. They find themselves presented with choices that they could take. In a certain sense, Spartans who took this point of view had it in mind to take the place of Athens as the great imperial power in the Aegean and beyond. We know for sure that some Spartans, and the chief figure here was Lysander, the Greek general, admiral, who had been responsible for winning the war, we know for sure that he and others around him liked that idea and sought to pursue it but they were not alone in that opinion. But in any case, you’d have to take that on and many a Spartan would have been deterred by that prospect, and again by the prospect of having to have a fleet, because there was no way to pursue this third policy without having a fleet that began to approach the power of the Athenian fleet when it had been strong. By the way, it’s a very nice word, because all the words that have to do with governor, government, govern all derive ultimately from the .So, this would have meant that all kinds of people who were not Spartiates would be critical for the success of such a mission of the overseas type, and so many a Spartan felt that was too much of a derangement of Spartan life and didn’t like it for that reason. After all, the Spartans had been sending fleets out to sea throughout the Peloponnesian War. Well anyway, however that might be, the man of the hour in 404 was Lysander, the great victor of the Peloponnesian War and his policy was the extreme policy, the “let’s conquer it all” policy. He was what the Spartans called a ; he was technically a bastard. On the one hand, this elevated his influence and power, everybody wondered at him and so on. This would really be a vacuum of people, of everything else and it’s certainly a vacuum of power, and it wouldn’t stay that way very long. Thebes and its Boeotian subordinates would come in and occupy it and that was not a desirable thing. So, he had in mind a very narrow oligarchy. That’s the way it always is and that’s the way it was in Athens as well. It was a terrifying prospect to tackle this regime, which looked like it was unbeatable. When he says that they’re going to Brazzaville to join the free French. By now the Thirty were worried enough about this nascent army to send an army of their own, much bigger, to try to get them and it’s at this point that I’m always reminded, again, talk about analogies of the events of Great Britain in the sixteenth-century England, I should say really, when the Spanish Armada was heading for England trying to gain control of the island for the Pope and Catholicism and one thing and another. And really the British — the English fleet didn’t do anywhere near as much damage to the Spanish fleet as did the winds. When the Thirty brought an army out to try to defeat him there he defeated them. The Thirty were deposed by the 3,000, because it was obvious they were losers and now the 3,000, the successor government to the Thirty, appealed to Sparta for help against this democratic army that Thrasybulus had put out. Of course, the people who would have been punished would have been oligarchs and their friends who were now the losing side. That newly restored democracy behaved with remarkable moderation. Aristotle in his  goes out of his way to praise this successor Athenian Regime. They took their collaborators, they tried them, and they killed them for the most part."
190,classics,clcv-205,lecture-22,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan examines the continuation of Spartan tyranny over the Greek and the response of the Greek world. According to Professor Kagan, it became clear that the Greek needed to do something to check the power of Sparta. So, Thebes, Argos, Corinth, and Athens along with some of the smaller  joined together to fight Sparta in the Corinthian War. The war ended in a stalemate, but now the Persians were afraid of the growth of Athenian naval power. So, the king made an alliance with Sparta to bring about the King’s Peace, which emphasized Greek autonomy and which had the effect of breaking up all alliances, except the Peloponnesian League. After this fact, Sparta continued in its tyrannical behavior.","In the year 401 the prince of Persia, Cyrus, who was a younger son and had recently succeeded the King of Persia, Artaxerxes, his older brother, was in power. The ones that they used on these campaigns are the ones that we are calling , people who had been helots, but who were liberated and permitted to fight for the Spartans, and the notion of sending  overseas to fight was very attractive to the Spartans, because it got them out of Laconia, for one thing, and provided them with soldiers as well. Reasonable guess is that he may have hoped by achieving something great for the great king he might receive back thanks from the great king in whatever form you can imagine. The war is dragging on and so they choose to send the new King Agesilaus, who is the son of Aegis, whose characteristics are among other things, that he was born lame; he probably would not have been allowed to live had he not come from the royal family, but he did and he grew to be an ambitious, aggressive Spartan King, who I suspect — I mean, a cheap psychology when you have a handicap like that in a society which values physical valor and strength, and military success so highly as the Spartans did, you’re twice as aggressive, and twice as ambitious as an ordinary Spartan. He was trying to make the case for a panhellenic motive for what was absolutely a strictly Spartan one and raising himself to a legendary level practically. Well, he goes to Asia and begins to encounter the Persians. We’re looking ahead but the action that caused that was the victory at Cnidus. Still, many of those towns as I say did return to Persian rule as well. So, that’s in the background, and all these other irritations that I have mentioned, but it wasn’t enough because even if you were as mad as you could be at the Spartans and determined to try to undo their effort at hegemony over the Greeks, there was no easy way to think of fighting them successfully. In fact in 402 when the Thebans and Corinthians refused to go to Elis with the Spartans, the Athenians sent their force, as they were required to do by their treaty with the Spartans. There was no war yet I should point out when this money is being handed out. One army coming from central Greece, from the region of Phocis and Locris, where they were assisting the Phocians, and another army being sent up from the Peloponnesus itself; they do finally meet in 395 at a town in western Boeotia called Haliartus where there is a battle, and where by the way, Lysander is killed in the fighting and removed from the scene. So, it was after that event had taken place that you see this union between Argos, which is a democracy, and this democratic government in Corinth, which is under siege for the reasons that I have suggested, and what they do is they arrange for a new situation where citizens of one state will be citizens of the other as well. So, for all these reasons there’s opposition to the bold policy and Antalcidas represents that. It doesn’t work in large part, because the enemies, that is Athens and Thebes particularly, and perhaps the others — sorry Corinth and Argos also, and I’ll tell you why in a moment, are not ready to do what is necessary from the Spartan point of view. This time Antalcidas again negotiates a peace and he really negotiates it with the great King of Persia. He did something also that the Athenians had done late in the Peloponnesian War; he establishes a customs house in the Hellespont in the Bosporus and every ship that goes through pays a tax to the Athenians. This is a peace that will benefit Persia and benefit Sparta at the expense of everybody else. The Spartans take it as a license to run Greece in the way that they see fit. Now the King of Persia is telling the Greeks what they must do. But the Spartans didn’t care much, because they were now in a position to exercise the power that the dominant force in Sparta, who is Agesilaus and his supporters, wanted to do. Then soon afterwards, the Spartans turn on another city in the Peloponnesus, the city of Phlyus, which is to the southwest of Corinth, not a very big city but not a small tiny one either, and what it turns out here is that the thing that the Phylasians have done that the Spartans don’t like is that they have been a democracy for part of the time. He was not punished with any severity; a mild fine or at least a fine was imposed. In the process, they set about organizing an alliance, a general alliance, meant against Sparta, which they were able to do in considerable part, because of all of the irritation that had been felt all around Greece by these terrible actions of the Spartans, and as I think I’ll tell you next time, they put together what we call the Second Athenian Confederation, and they made an alliance with the newly liberated Thebes."
191,classics,clcv-205,lecture-23,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan describes the growth of a new power: Thebes. Under the leadership of Epaminondas and Pelopidas, Thebes grows into a major power among the Greek cities. In fact, the Thebans even rout the Spartans in a standard hoplite battle in the battle of Leuctra. Finally, Professor Kagan points out that by the time of Theban hegemony, the Greek world had experienced so many wars and conflicts that it opened the door to a powerful leader: Philip of Macedon.","Let me remind you that the Spartans, ever since their victory in the Peloponnesian War had been attempting to extend their hegemony, at first all the way over into Asia, and then when that was thwarted, they tried to do so on the mainland of Greece, and one consequence of their effort and the failure to achieve it in an easy way was the restoration of Athens to a primary position in the Greek world. But starting with the successful Theban rebellion which overthrew the Spartan command of the city, the Thebans launched a period of growth in power, influence, wealth, and even to some degree extent which justifies modern historians in speaking about a period perhaps beginning in 371 and running at least a decade, to which they give the name the Theban Hegemony, and today I want to talk about how that happened and how it sort of developed and ended. They produced a better army; they began defeating their enemies as they had not done before. Every time the Spartans came in they ravaged the Boeotian countryside and did harm to these Boeotian towns. So, it was Thebes that was the defender, the protector of the Boeotians against the Spartans, and this certainly gave them popularity; it helps explain why this new Boeotian confederation was so effective and so loyal. Spartans haven’t been defeated by anybody; they’re still the most serious power, and they’re still the power that stands for Persian power in the Greek world, but things have become more complicated as Thebes has emerged on the scene. All the attacking has been by the Spartans into Boeotia, which means these wars have always been costly to Boeotia but not to Sparta, and we’ll see that one of the things that Epaminondas wants to do when he can is to reverse that situation. You can go there today and look at it; it really is pretty easy to place the ancient story into the modern geography. This is a sort of a typical hoplite battlefield. So, I’ll take a few moments to talk about the battle itself. So Epaminondas comes up with certainly — nobody can deny that he came up with some kind of plan. Have you got numbers Curtis on that or just got a general idea? When you kill the general you win; Curtis knows more about military history in the Greek world than anybody. We shall see it immediately shook the control of the Spartans, even over the Peloponnesus. That means it ran from Washington to Boston. When a state is suddenly enormously powerful — I think the political scientists’ rules and I admit what I just said has been known and been said by many of them many times, but the favorite thing is if there’s a great power what happens next? They cannot go out to fight these people invading their homeland. It is one of the really most brilliant things I have ever seen, because to be successful in the war I’m talking about now requires not only shrewd use of military forces for military purposes, but it has to be integrated with constant political negotiation and conversation with the natives, which has to be associated also with certain economic conditions being brought about so that the people who might be on the other side can be on your side and then you can have them work for you. But in any case, until that happened there are very few cases of really successful urban warfare without a tremendous cost. What I’m getting at is, yes I’m sure that if Epaminondas had wanted to, he would have been able to defeat the Spartans in their city, but he would have paid a great price. Well, he is a nasty, unpleasant fellow; not really. We do know a lot about what Sherman thought he was doing because he wrote about it. But Pelopidas died fighting in a battle against Jason. So in 362 when the Thebans again put together a force to invade the Peloponnesus, to put down those forces that were working against his settlement, it was only Epaminondas who was in charge. Although, as we look at the world in 362, we should realize that Thebes remains a very formidable power and the Greeks again, I want to warn you, don’t know that Thebes isn’t going to come back with two new leaders or ten new leaders, or one or whatever and become the same kind of a menace that it had been before, but looking back we can see that that was the outcome. ”So, here’s a case for the unimportance of warfare, you might say, for those people who want to make that case."
192,classics,clcv-205,lecture-24,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan tells the story of the rise of Philip and describes his early actions: unifying Macedon, defeating barbarian armies, and creating a new, professional, national army. According to Professor Kagan, through these actions, Philip was able to make inroads into the Greek world. What made these inroads more effective was Philip’s uncanny talent for diplomacy and the fighting between the various. Eventually, the Greeks under the efforts of Athens and Demosthenes decided to face Philip in the battle of Chaeronea. The battle, though close, was won by Philip and his Macedonian forces. Finally, Professor Kagan evaluates the actions of Demosthenes and concludes that his actions should be judged as a noble endeavor of one who loved freedom.","I call it, “Philip, Demosthenes and the Fall of the Polis,” and I read that to you because it’s always useful to remember that while we look back on these events and know their outcome and can assign to them a special significance, let’s never forget they didn’t know that they were on the brink of the end of the independent . But for the Greeks it had a different meaning; it was people who participated in the culture that they designated as Hellenic and they thought the Macedonians fell outside of that. On the other hand, the king was an important and powerful character so that you have — this was true of European feudal states at certain periods in their development. On the one hand, the fundamental society was based upon great lords, great noblemen, barons, but there was a king and he was not inconsequential. He was treated very decently and with respect, and he spent his time in the house of Epaminondas. But as I’m saying at the moment, he crafted this great grand new army, supplied, led, and organized quite differently from what I have described to you in the past as the standard Greek practice, which was essentially the hoplite phalanx, and as you know, in the course of the Peloponnesian War in the fourth century new gimmicks were added to that and different devices were contributed to it but still that was true. It’s very imperfect, but it’s not the worst analogy possible, but I remember Hitler kept saying before his strength was great enough simply to launch a major war he would say, if you give me this that’s all I’m interested in, that is absolutely my last territorial demand in Europe, and then in a few months he would then seize Austria or something like that. The more recent scholarship has suggested that the Athenians were not really very oppressive, which leaves for, I think, for them an uncomfortable question, if that’s true why was there this rebellion in the years 357 to 355? The priests then call on other Greeks traditionally led by Sparta but not always to beat up the people who have taken over the oracle’s place and drive them out and restore it to the priest. Well, this is another in that theory, in that series of events. Thebes and Phocis are involved in a war over Delphi. Thebes, last time we looked at Thebes, Thebes had reached a position of power perhaps greater than that of Athens, but you remember the deaths of Pelopidas and Epaminondas simply did not allow Thebes to continue to have that vitality and power that it had before. The assembly voted it and the people win. There were some Athenians who had never given up their hope that an oligarchy could be placed into Athens, instead of a democracy. If you were hostile, if you were a member of the hawk faction, you would say your opponents were deluding themselves about the degree of the danger and that Philip was a very special kind of a menace. He charged the Athenians with having created the great danger that they faced by making Philip into a great man through neglect by their refusal to stop him when it was relatively easy to do so. There really didn’t seem to be much disagreement among the Athenians as to the desirability of this peace, even Demosthenes who is normally opposed to anything like it, felt that it probably had to be done, and I think that just reflected the realities of the distribution of power and also of the willingness of the Athenians to do anything more than that, and so there is this period of the Peace of Philocrates in which the Athenians make a defensive alliance with Philip. This time the people who want to restore power to the priests invite Philip to lead the Greek forces in the Sacred War. First of all, it recognizes the Macedonians as Greeks in the truest sense of the word. So, he takes his army, he runs into the Phocians, blasts the Phocian army and does what he was asked to do. Well, this must have had an enormously intimidating effect on many in the Greek world, and it becomes more and more Athens that has to take the lead, if anybody is going to resist. So, taking on Athens, if you really want to take the city, is a job that’s very difficult indeed. Small point but not so trivial that the Athenians were able even to enlist the support in language at least by Persia. As it turns out, the Persians don’t do anything of importance in resisting Philip, but it shows you how Demosthenes and those Greeks who agreed with him were attempting to put together as strong a coalition as they could to try to stop him. It was an offensive and defensive alliance. As would finally be accomplished, not by Philip and Macedon, but by the Romans, because it was all part of the great plan without which there could not have been Christianity. The difference between heroic victory and disaster can be terribly thin. In spite of the outcome, it seems to me that the stand of Athens and its Greek allies at Chaeronea may have been in words that Churchill used in another context, “their finest hour.”"
193,classics,clcv-205,lecture-2,"In this lecture, Professor Donald Kagan explores the earliest history of Greek civilization. He demonstrates how small agricultural enclaves eventually turned into great cities of power and wealth in the Bronze Age, taking as his examples first Minoan Crete and then Mycenaean Greece. He also argues that these civilizations were closely related to the great monarchies of the ancient Near East. He points out that the Mycenaean age eventually came to an abrupt end probably through a process of warfare and migration. Reconstructing the Mycenaean age is possible through archaeological evidence and through epic poetry (Homer). Finally, he provides an account of the collapse of the Mycenaean world, and explains how in its aftermath, the Greeks were poised to start their civilization over on a new slate.","I’m going to talk to you today about the beginnings of the Greek experience as far as we know it, and I should warn you at once that the further back in history you go the less secure is your knowledge, especially at the beginning of our talk today when you are in a truly prehistoric period. So what we think we know derives chiefly from archeological evidence, which is before writing — mute evidence that has to be interpreted and is very complicated, and is far from secure. It, too, was very similar to the civilization, but apparently a little bit newer in the Nile Valley in Egypt, about which we know a great deal more than we know about the Minoans because, as you know, in the nineteenth century, scholars discovered how to read the languages that were written in Egypt and in Mesopotamia. So, they were able to develop something approaching history for the period we’re talking about. So barring that, nonetheless, what we see reminds us very much of these ancient Bronze Age early civilizations. And please keep in mind that they are Greek speakers; and we know this with confidence, something we didn’t know at the beginning of the twentieth century, because written evidence is available on a bunch of clay tablets that were accidentally baked in some conflagration in these places. Off he went to the northeast Peloponnesus to the site where he thought it might be, Mycenae, from Homer’s account — I wouldn’t be telling you this story, and you know the outcome. So, the citadel and the farmland surrounding it, make up fundamentally the unit which is the Mycenaean kingdom. So, you must imagine these are successive kings who are being buried in this, what must have been, sacred soil. So, that makes it clear we’re talking about a wealthy civilization, at least in which the rulers are wealthy, and in which the rulers, of course, are very powerful. Think of them as some combination of oil and perfume. In the case of the Pharaohs of Egypt, the Pharaoh was himself a god, and insisted on being worshipped in that way. There are other things that have to do with instructions that the king is sending out to people from the palace. The records discovered at Pylos here are particularly interesting. They cover only one part of a year and yet they carry details of thousands of transactions in hundreds of places. Egypt experiences a number of attacks from the outside world. Similarly, attacks are going on against the kingdoms of Syria and of Palestine, which — it’s always hard to know what that piece of land should be called at any particular moment, but I call it Palestine because one of the sea peoples that attacked the Nile around 1200 in Egypt are called the , and most scholars suggest that is the same name as came to be the name for this region when they ruled it, called Palestine. So those are the things that helped people decide that the Dorians may really have been the sons of Hercules, who actually invaded and that what we find after the fall of the Mycenaean world in Greece are some of the following things — things that were not typically found in the Mycenaean world. For this I think there’s a very good — whether or not you accept the Dorian idea — I think we should find attractive the idea that if there was an external invasion, it came in this way over a period of time, a century or two with success and then retreat, not having success, flight, all that kind of stuff going on. But they spent a lot of time, energy, and money on being sure that they would have a supply of water to hold them for a long siege. The Greek world has this tremendous discontinuity. The Greeks borrow that with typical Greek innovation. Dark, in the most obvious way, because we don’t have any writing, no record of them. They’re simply working within their own very narrow ambit. They were bigger, they were stronger, they were tougher, they were faster, they were more beautiful, they lived longer. Then, finally, we have to believe, there’s no escaping, I think, that there was another thing that provided for memory, something we call the epic tradition. But what there is, is very important and no part of it is more important than the Homeric poems themselves. There’s nothing like that in the Mycenaean world."
194,classics,clcv-205,lecture-3,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan addresses what scholars call the Homeric question. He asks: what society do Homer’s poems describe? He argues that in view of the long oral transmission of the poems, the poems of Homer probably reflect various ages from the Mycenaean world to the Dark Ages. More importantly, close scrutiny of the poems will yield historical information for the historian. In this way, one is able to reconstruct through the poems, to a certain extent, the post-Mycenaean world. Finally, Professor Kagan says a few words on the heroic ethic of the Greek world.","Our topic today is the Dark Ages and the world of Homer, and of course, you have as one of your reading assignments a problem that deals precisely with that question that asks the subordinate question: was there a real world that Homer’s poems refer to? There isn’t anything to be found is what Snodgrass says. I would say the one that says you can’t learn anything from this is an outlier. It strikes me as being better supported than the others, but we really have to keep an open mind because in this prehistoric period, you have to be very modest about what you think you know about it. And of course, I’ve already mentioned the poems of Homer turn out to be a very large source for what most people look to. I believe anything written in ancient Latin or Greek unless I can’t. So, in those cases I abandon the ancient evidence. But I think we would be told also very many true things, which came down to us. Now, we mentioned how important the poems are. Well, Homer has his heroes using chariots and we know that chariots were used in warfare in the Bronze Age around the Mediterranean Sea. So, you would say, well, that’s another place where Homer got it right, except for the fact that we also know how chariots are used in warfare and the closest analogy, I think, is to think of chariots as tanks. Achilles or Patroclus, or whoever is on his chariot, is driving. He is riding from the ships or wherever he is from the camp to the battlefield. Now, the differences between what we find in the Homeric poems are also very illuminating, differences between that and what we know happened after the fall of the Mycenaean world. One is the bedroom and the other is the loom. For instance, in historical times when the Greeks referred to the great King of Persia, who was a real king and a powerful figure, a king in every sense, the word they used for him was . They would’ve had all kinds of subordinate officials taking care of that. Another thing that these kings are seen to do, which is in a way even at a lower level, is to be herdsmen. They have athletic contests and they ask Odysseus to participate. You can’t call — we know Odysseus himself is a  — him a merchant. It depends, could have been 18, could have been 20. And he finally does ascertain that Apollo is angry with the Greeks because Agamemnon took a maiden from her father, and that father was a priest of Apollo. There is nothing out of line in the sense of violating some kind of a real rule of the society, but it’s not typical, and especially since Agamemnon has this position as the boss, the most kingly of the kings. You don’t understand the game that Agamemnon is playing,” and he explains it to him, and the guy says, “Oh, okay.” A very good example of that is what I’ve been telling you; that’s really what happens. They did make amazingly powerful claims for human beings as opposed to divinity, compared to any society that I know anything about. Well, it’s interesting, I think, to compare the Greek way of dealing with this human problem that we all have, the problem of death. But for the Greeks, as I think for quite a few other people in the ancient world, death was nothing in the worst sense of the word. That is what I mean when I speak of the tragic view, and it’s very important. Or if you didn’t believe in God, this was just a natural right. What it really does is to evade the question that I’m talking about. Well, you know the choice he took and you know that it turned out to be right."
195,classics,clcv-205,lecture-4,"In this lecture, Professor Donald Kagan offers a sketch of the Greek heroic code of ethics. He shows that in this community,  (manly virtue) and honor are extremely important and even worth dying for, as the case of Achilles makes clear. In addition, Professor Kagan shows how this society eventually produced a new phenomenon, the rise of the . The discussion ends with a strong emphasis on the importance of the  in Greek history.","Last time I was talking to you about the world of Homer from the side of, you might say, the life of the mind rather than the practical matters of society by talking about values and ethics in the world of Homer. Well, erase all of those ideas from your head when you think about the world of Homer, and I would say, the world of Greece in the period we’re studying. These are the masculine qualities as the Greeks saw them and primarily among them was the idea of courage: physical courage, moral courage, mental courage, manly courage in battle is the most core aspect of this word, an idea which comes to spread and to be much more encompassing than that. They must be recognized by the people among whom they lived, by the communities in which they live. We are talking about a society, therefore, the anthropologists have come up with, which I think is a useful distinction. So, it is from the beginning a society in which the community is a critical element, maybe the critical element, an individual who didn’t live in a society could not achieve the kinds of glory and fame, and recognition that you expect from a hero. You are born to be one of these people because your father was such a person belonging to the right families and so on. The noble families of Greece, and we see it already in Homer, typically claim descent from some god or other and ordinary people do not have that ability. You’ve been signed up by your city or by this expedition to fight and you’ve got to fight.” So, you would think they have some allegiance to them. It was clear, he was another Achilles in his own eyes, and it was for him to achieve the great deeds that I have been mentioning. It’s not just an accident that this reveals the characteristic of each one of these cultures. The secular approach is very, very Greek versus a religious approach. We don’t have in American society an , an , we don’t have our own bible, but I think Mark Twain’s Huck Finn is really very, very revealing to see what is so different about us in the modern times from the Homeric world. So when you do that, you have to be punished. That, I think, is a very thumbnail sketch of the Judeo-Christian story. It requires political and social organization. At that point, the gods don’t like it because like the Judeo-Christian god, they want to have some boundary between the two, but for them it’s very important, because the boundary is far from clear. And, of course, now for the rest of his life, he must just go about as a kind of a beggar, having been this former tremendously great king. He understands that, he has acted immoderately. The isolation of the Greek towns in the Dark Age gives way increasingly to contact with the east and the south, and when I say the south I really mean Egypt and all around the eastern Aegean Sea. The word  appears in Homer, but it means something different from what it means throughout most of Greek history. Therefore, when he is without virtue, man is the most savage of animals. The Phocaeans chose instead to take their city, which is to say, all the people in the city, put them on ships, sailed to the far west, and organized a new city out there. So, there is that kind of a boundary as well, and that is a place where trouble is likely to emerge. An answer from twentieth-century America, very small. You’re talking about lots and lots of them."
196,classics,clcv-205,lecture-5,"In this lecture, Professor Donald Kagan tells the story of the emergence of the polis from the Dark Ages. He shows that by the time of the poet Hesiod, there is already a  in place. He describes the importance of the  in the Greek world and explains that it was much more than a mere place of habitation; it was a place where there was justice, law, community, and a set of cultural values that held Greeks together. Finally, Professor Kagan argues, following the lead of Victor David Hanson, that the  came to be chiefly through the emergence of a new man: the hoplite farmer.","Okay, we were discussing the rise of the  and I was into the subject of the way the Greeks thought about the significance and the function of the , which is really critical in distinguishing between the example of a city state and other city states in history. There is no way to talk about what he’s talking about in the kinds of settlements that existed before the invention of the , and that I think is worth mentioning. No, the right thing to do is to take care of yourself and the hell with the . Little bit later, when we get to talking about Sparta, you’ll see a beautiful example of that in the form of the poems of Tyrtaeus, who is a poet in Sparta, and whose poetry became so central to their way of thinking and living that they were used as marching songs for the Spartan army as they walked, and they make the same point, but I’ll come back to that. In my view, he put the question this way. Since, the Greeks really didn’t believe in personal immortality, how do you find what everybody wants? I’ll bet even all of you can remember songs that you have known all your life, but not other things. She stills the gall of wearisome hate and under her influence all life among mankind is harmonious and does well. The  makes, a good , following good laws, makes its citizens better. A ought to make men like that, and in fact, there’s a great revolution in the political theory presented by the American constitution in that it’s not the first thing to do it, but it was the first one that was really applied, in turning away, rejecting the possibility that a constitution could make men better. This is something brand new in the world and we shall see how it crops up in different forms and how it shapes the course of Greek history. All of us have this natural selfishness when we are born. The second has to do with how they fought. And that climate by the way and that whole scene is very similar to the Mediterranean kind of climate that the Greek farmers were engaged in, and so it had potentially, Hanson thought, and I think he was right, proper analogous possibilities and he came to the conclusion that much could be learned about the development of the if one looked at the business of how one farms in these kinds of environments. They are not permitted individual initiative; they are controlled. You can imagine that this can only happen gradually; none of this happens overnight. He points out that the knowledge of how to do this, of how to grow the kind of grapes you want, viticulture, and also arboriculture, both of these, are learned from Asia. So you try, if you can grow grain on your land or you grow it where you can, if not, you have to get it elsewhere. So, you send it off to a middleman who does the turning of the grapes and the olives into the liquids that are necessary, and he takes a good bit of the profit. They acquired the equipment necessary; grape and olive presses which allowed them to purify and to produce the final product, and that made them more successful than they otherwise would have been, and also another great thing that you have to be able to do, if you’re going to succeed as a farmer, if you have to have places to store what you produce, so that you will have it for next year when you need it. This is the first time we have such a reference. It’s probably more oligarchic or aristocratic, but the point is this is something we haven’t heard of ever before. There is clearly some kind of an official group that has some sort of political role to play, which is popular in its character. He has all of these noblemen around him, all of whom claim to be as you recall, and a fairer way to put this would be that this is largely an aristocratic society, that was our conclusion after we looked at the poems of Homer, and I think that’s what continues, even after the world of Mycenae. When these tyrannies take place, they last for different periods of time, but when the tyrant is removed, what follows after that is, there is never again in that town a one-man rule of any kind."
197,classics,clcv-205,lecture-6,"In this lecture, Professor Donald Kagan discusses the emergence of a new style of warfare among the Greeks, the hoplite . After discussing the panoply of the hoplite solider and the method of fighting, he argues that this style of fighting came about early in the life of the . In addition, he shows that the  was almost invincible on the field. At the lecture’s conclusion, he answers several questions from students about hoplite warfare in the Greek world.","We were discussing, in the broadest sense, the emergence and the development of the and specifically I had been telling you about Hanson’s theory about the development of the family farm and the individuals who worked the family farm as a critical element in that story. Their role as soldiers, fighting for the common cause — and that common cause now being not an individual goal, not a family goal, but the goal of the entire civic community, which was coming into being and I suppose would have had to come into being, in order to have this role, fighting for one’s .The style of warfare that emerges in this period, apparently for the first time, is what we call the hoplite phalanx and each half of that needs to be explained. You want to get out of your head the notion of a shield that’s a little thing that you can move around with one hand, like that, real easy; that’s not what it was. If somebody can come at him from this side, he is very vulnerable from there. Well, the answer is, in the traditional view, is that he was never meant to stand by himself. But I think we can imagine some part of it more easily than the other. So, let’s see if I can, again, give you some sense of what this is like. Now, that gives you the picture of the individual; I hope you can get some sense of what the  might be like, but as I try to describe how the fighting really went, I always find it necessary to ask for some audience participation, so that you can get some idea of what it might have looked like in a very, very limited way. Make it a third row; there’s enough for a third row. Probably never that easy but really, you’re just not going to lose, and the truth of the matter is that hoplites beat non-hoplites in all battles that are fought on flat land in battles that the Greeks fight in. That wasn’t just because they sort of had an aesthetic pleasure in nice flat fields. But what the Greeks spent most of their time doing was fighting each other, one hoplite against another hoplite .So, you have to imagine that this thing started with these guys back in their camp and the other army back in its camp, and they both have to agree that they want to have a battle, for a battle to take place, and they will have picked a place that is flat where they can do what they’re doing. Well, typically the two armies aren’t identical in size. It is about D-Day; there’s a wonderful scene where this German officer comes down; he’s in charge of the defensive arrangements there at Normandy; he’s in a bunker, and he’s reporting back to headquarters and it’s dark, and suddenly there’s enough light that he sees suddenly on the horizon is 5,000 ships, the whole damn fleet. Thucydides has an interesting passage in there, in which he says that the Spartans win the Battle of Mantinea and Thucydides says that the Spartans did not pursue the hoplite. They cannot rest quietly in Hades unless their body has been properly buried; so you got to do it. If you can see it, all adult males fought. They were not farmers as we shall see, and therefore, they spent their lives practicing warfare. You never, according to my understanding of this, you never, never want to be without your shield. Well, what happens is one army is invading the land of the other. So, that would be the classic way of determining how it works. Probably, though, you wouldn’t want to have the very youngest guys up front, because another thing you want is experience. But I think that depth would have been determined by how many soldiers you had available. So, there would be some inclination to capture men rather than to kill them. You kill enough guys to achieve your goal and if you’re still rational you take the rest prisoner. So, I think that became — and whatever the reality was, that story was always being told, that’s the way for a man to fight; anything other than that is open to suspicion. There’s just one more thing you need to know about this mode of fighting. When the  fought against any other infantry formation the  wins; from the time we first hear of Greeks fighting non-Greeks, when the Greeks have the , I think I’m right in saying they never lose a battle. And those Greeks marched 1,500 miles into the center of the Persian Empire, down into Babylonia, fight the army of the Persian king, defeat the army of the Persian king, but unfortunately the prince who led them down there is killed in the battle, making the victory rather pointless, because the whole idea was to make him king. You can see I’m not too friendly to that interpretation, but it is being taken very, very seriously."
198,classics,clcv-205,lecture-7,"In this lecture, Professor Donald Kagan explores the rise of Greek colonies. He argues that the rise of new colonies was primarily due to the need for new farmland, although he acknowledges several other important reasons. He also shows where the Greeks colonized and explains that the process of founding a new colony probably took place within the dynamics of a . Finally, he offers a few important outcomes of this colonizing impulse.","We have been looking at the question of the rise of the  and the various significant elements that were part of the making of the , and of course I’ve emphasized the notion of this new class of people, the farmer hoplite citizen, as being the critical element in shaping the  and for my money that’s what the  is about to start with and then it develops characteristics consistent with that, and some that challenge that over the centuries. The date that’s sort of typical for the general phenomenon of colonization coming out of the mother cities of Greece is again that date we keep talking about, 750 roughly. Now, the first question I suppose, before I get to describing what a colony was and how it worked, we want to ask the question what was it that led Greeks to sail or walk, mostly to sail very great distances from their mother cities. So then there’s the whole idea — we’ve already given you some sense that the Greeks were ancestor worshippers. Then there are always things that we might call much less rational than that. In any group of people there is a small minority, I want to emphasize small, who just love to do risky things. Remember that these are  from the Greek point of view. Because he knows something about it; either he has somehow traveled out there himself and said, the place I’m thinking about has a wonderful harbor, it has good farmland in the neighborhood, and a critical element to making this judgment is that it is not occupied by hostile natives who will resist vigorously your landing there. And so he decided to investigate this and he took with him a fine geologist from Wesleyan just to go to the place there at Delphi and to see whether it could be true that such gases did come out, and what sort of gases they were, and what consequences they would have, and you know I wouldn’t be telling you this story if it hadn’t turned out that they discovered evidence that, in my judgment, but I don’t think really anybody doubts it anymore, that totally confirmed the Greek story. Now, recruiting is tremendously important because you need to have a certain number of settlers to make the settlement viable. So, there would always be some opportunity for you to go out and make your pitch. Syracuse finds itself besieged by the Athenians. They go to Corinth asking the Corinthians to please help us. Now, there are exceptions in both directions, and as it happens the cases I know best have to do with the city of Corinth. Okay, so this gives you some idea of the range of possible relationships between colony and mother city. Then as you move east along that coast, you come to the Gallipoli Peninsula, all of which is now Turkey and for the rest of what I’m going to be saying for awhile, it’ll be Turkey as well, but through the straits, the Dardanelles, Sea of Marmara, Bosporus, Greek cities all over on both sides. So there are no Greek cities as you keep coming down and pass Palestine. It is a completely different thing from the  that I’ve been talking about. However, once you get beyond the Carthaginians advance into Spain, there are now Greek cities on the coast of Spain and there continue to be Greek cities, not everywhere, but in a spotty way into France of which the most important and famous is the one that the Romans called Masillia, Marseille, a Greek town. So, in the period we’re talking about there are no Romans that you have to worry about. So, now I hope you have in your mind a picture of the way the Greek world had expanded by the time this wave of colonization was complete — pretty complete, sometime in the seventh century B.C. Just a word about the leading colonizers, because I think there’s something to be learned from that. One of the things you kind of speculate about, and wonder about, why did some cities send out lots of colonies, some cities send out only a few, and others none at all for quite a while. It might well be that the people who won those wars, internal wars, would have been glad to send them away rather than to have these discontented people and these folks who were their enemies hanging around town and making trouble. They had very little to teach or to impose upon those people rather than vice versa. Anybody who looks at Greek mythology and Greek poetry, and Greek stories sees there is a powerful influence coming into Greek thought from mainly the Mesopotamian direction. They would be in commerce and they would be in industry in this small sense and doing all the various things that are not farming and so you now have classes or groups of people who have interests rather different from those of the most primitive  you could imagine. Well, they didn’t have to stay and fight it out."
199,classics,clcv-205,lecture-8,"In this lecture, Professor Donald Kagan explores the rise, fall, and significance of tyrannies in the Greek . He argues that the various tyrannies in the Greek world had both negative and positive aspects, which need to be appreciated. For instance, on the one hand, tyrannies promoted economic, commercial and artistic advances. On the other hand, tyrannies ruled absolutely and curbed the freedom of the . Finally, Professor Kagan intimates that tyrannies in many ways were a necessary step in the development of the classical . In short, through tyrannies, the power and influence of the aristocracy was broken and the hoplite farmer grew greater in significance.","Before I start on today’s topic, which is Greek tyranny, I have been asked to say a word on the subject — well, to answer the question really best I can, if the hoplite phalanx was so stunningly successful in the period of the sixth, fifth, fourth centuries B.C., why was it that other peoples, other than the Greeks, the ones who came in contact with them and saw it and were victimized by it, why didn’t they adopt it? Happily, that question isn’t so bad because when we get to the story of the Spartans, which comes after our story of the tyrants, I will read to you some of the poetry which was the material with which Spartans were trained, and you’ll quickly see why the Greek ethos, the Greek feeling of absolute commitment, voluntary absolute commitment, even at the risk of your life for the  was the central most important force in society. The character of a regime and the character of the fighting; I did tell you about that. The first time the word  or some version of it appears in Greek that we have comes in the fragments of the poet, Archilochus, and he is a fascinating character. This is where the word tyranny comes into the picture. Even in that small collection of words, you get some idea of what the Greeks meant by tyranny. A  does not have to explain himself and nobody would dare insist that he do. So, this would be a king of a large and important area. That was a tremendous honor and it indicated deference to him and scholars suggest, if it really happened, it would have suggested that the Argives and Pheidon were the dominant force in the Peloponnesus. Nothing is more basic than determining something like that. Nobody claims it’s universal, but one feature that seems to be plausibly present is that the new way of fighting in the hoplite phalanx, which was to turn out to be decisive, well that brought about the leaders who were very good leaders of hoplite phalanxes and should they decide to seize power in any state where they had been doing the leadership, they could typically count on their army, the army they had led to assist them — all which makes obvious sense if you’re going to get the fighting force around and they like you and you’re popular, and you want to be a boss, that’s your best shot. But the first step would have been a tyranny, because that’s the way they got to where they had to go in the first instance. Argos is a special place but Argos, in addition to being a fine agricultural area, also from an early time had commercial activity. But then on top of that, the next three towns I’m going to mention as being very active in colonization — you’re familiar with that from our last talk, Corinth and a little town that I haven’t mentioned before, but it’s right next to Corinth and surely was part of the same set of developments that we’ve described there, a place called Sicyon. People like that in America today used to be called republicans. Well, now you want to keep that name in your mind and you want to keep it straight, there will be a descendant of that guy, who will be an Athenian, whose name is Cleisthenes, he will not only be later but thoroughly different; not a tyrant, quite different from that. You can see very objective set of names and evaluations; so you’ve got vengeance here. ”Well, the story that Herodotus tells and I think you will enjoy it, in his wonderful prose if you haven’t gotten to it yet. By the way, he himself was a very significant figure, and this again makes him not so very unusual among the tyrants. Then he flips upside down and begins to dance on his hands, with his feet flipping around in the air, at which point Herodotus tells us. Well, what are we to believe of that tale? Gyges says, no, no, no please your majesty. They have personal power, whatever else is going on, they have control of the military, and the military gives them what they need in the way of command. So the come from these tyrannical periods. So that is all part of a story that would have made the tyrannies much more widely supported and not so easy to knock over as you might think. He would have been a full fledged citizen. I would say that by destroying that and substituting for some kind of an economic basis for what role you play, they actually opened the door for a form of government that didn’t come in many places, but did come in some, and I’m talking about a Greek democracy. Herodotus uses tyranny critically — well, you know, by and large, he depicts the King of Persia, who finally invades Greece first in 490 and then another king in 480, these men are tyrants, because they fit precisely the categorization of tyranny as the Greeks know it. He is punishing Prometheus for his good deeds towards men, which make men more divine than they would otherwise be. It is a distinguishing feature in Greek thought."
200,classics,clcv-205,lecture-9,"In this lecture, Professor Donald Kagan explores the development and character of Sparta. He points out that in Sparta, the ethos of the  was present to an extraordinary degree. Then he describes how this came about. In short, Professor Kagan argues that the Spartans were able to create a distinct military culture on account of their subjugation of the inhabitants of Messenia, who were forced to carry on the work of farming while the Spartans trained for war. Finally, Professor Kagan examines the education and training of the Spartan citizen as well as the constitution of Sparta.","Well, as we continue with our investigation of the emergence and development of the , we come to the  — just to use its proper name in Greek, Lacedaemon, and that is the proper Greek name for it, but the capital city of it was Sparta and its people were called Spartans. So, it’s worthwhile, and of course — it’s added to these ideas and feelings about the Spartans, there is the fact that Sparta would emerge in the sixth century as the most powerful of the  and the first leader of a lasting alliance of states with the Spartans as the leading power among them, the first international organization you might say if you were speaking loosely, so that there is a practical aspect to it. Well, not only is this date not widely believed, hardly any scholar would take that seriously, and then people do argue about when would the changes have taken place, and if there was a Lycurgus, when he would have introduced these laws. But the conquest of Mycenae in the first Mycenaean War, as this is called, is very important, because now the Spartans conquer a very large number of people whom they turn into helots. They are permanently angry, they are permanently thinking about somehow getting free and permanently, therefore, presenting a threat to whatever the Spartan regime is at the time. You will find when people know about the Greeks and they know about Sparta, I’m talking about of course in the West, philosophers and others are struck just as Plato and Aristotle were by certain things about the Spartan way of life that make them take it seriously and admire it. Now, there was slavery all over the ancient world. If you want to think about Greek slavery in the seventh century B.C., think about what I told you about Hanson’s reconstruction of the development of the . Most scholars would have accepted that without question; lately, some scholars have come up and wanted to question it. The child, the infant, brand new baby will be killed. The reason for that was that they had a clue about eugenics. The descriptions of Eton and Harrow, and even more harrowing places than that; surely, you must have read novels by Englishmen talking about their school days and each one sounds like a torture chamber. They don’t have shoes, they are given one cloak. They are fed enough, of course, to keep them healthy and going, but no more, not to satisfy their appetite. The kind of things that they are taught are moral lessons that are meant to be the things that they live by, that they are raised by, and in a few moments I’ll read to you an example of the kind of thing that was part of that musical training; of course, gymnastics and military training I mentioned before. But the extraordinary thing to remember is this was a phase, a passing phase, that is this relationship started when one was a boy, and one was a man, and when the boy reached manhood himself, then he was no longer in that relationship and he himself could become an  and find himself an , although it would be surprising if he didn’t continue to have a very close friendship and association with the older man who had been his .This is the other thing. Just to make that clear, let me make it plain that the rest of the Greeks treated women very, very differently from men, and one thing that was very striking and the difference was that the men engaged in physical exercise, especially in these competitions that were part of the great games, and those were always carried out in the nude. So, on the one hand, you have women who are treated more like men in Sparta than in other places and indeed they even had greater legal rights than they did in other states. That is a catalog of all the things that people admire and want for themselves, and regard as important in Homer; everything, those are the characteristics that every hero wants, and he says, I don’t give a damn for all that says Tyrtaeus for no man — I’m sorry I skipped an important line. “ I don’t care about any of those things not if he had all splendors except for a fighting spirit. His tomb is pointed to with pride and so are his children, and his children’s children, and afterward all the race that is his. Aging, he has reputation among his citizens. No one tries to interfere with his honors or all he deserves. In the streets he is bound to make way when he occupies a seat; he must give it up even to a younger man. They serve — and this is very important — as generals who lead the Spartan army. So the kings are in a position to hand out very important honors to their fellow Spartans, and that I think is another one of the important privileges they have. They tell that woman whom she’s going to marry. Likewise, if there are adoptions of children from one family to another, it is the kings who make these decisions."
201,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-10,"Genomic conflict arises when the interests of various genomic elements, such as chromosomes and cytoplasmic organelles, are not aligned. These conflicts arise in two situations: either when one unit is contained within another, as a mitochondrion is contained within a cell, or when inheritance is asymmetrical. Genomic conflict can thus occur within a cell, within an organism, or between two organisms, such as a mother and developing fetus. There have been several steps taken to avoid these conflicts in sexual species, including the fairness of meiosis and the uniparental inheritance of cytoplasmic genomes.","Okay, today we’re going to talk about evolutionary conflicts, and this is an area of evolutionary biology that contacts other disciplines, including the Humanities, in interesting ways. And I want to say that up front so that–and I’ll give you a signal when I transit from reliable stuff to speculative stuff, because I don’t want you thinking that the speculative stuff is written in stone. So let’s begin by looking at these plant flowers. Plantago is something that you may very well have dug out of your lawn. It is in their interests to take the organism that they’re sitting in and turn it into a pure female. And you can see that dramatically in the external morphology of the plant. ”And that was Bill Hamilton, the guy that came up with kin selection, and wrote a lot on evolutionary conflict. And then that outline there represents what is well-established and reliable. In a sexual lineage, sex is creating genetic variation within the nuclear genome. So, for example, there could be a conflict between bacterial plasmids and chromosomes. So that changes selection dynamics, at a higher level, and this plasmid will spread through the population. If you only get the cytoplasmic genome from one parent, then they’ll very likely all be the same genotype–any kind of process like this going on in the past would have assured that there would only be one left standing, in that parent–and therefore they’re not in conflict with each other. It does happen, but it’s a one in a billion chance. And before I go into the reproductive problems in humans that result from conflict, I’d just like to emphasize that this vision of evolution doesn’t sound like the beautifully adapted world where all is for the best, in the best of all possible worlds. So those are prizes that are worth oh six or seven-hundred-thousand dollars, and like Nobel Prizes, they are awarded in Sweden, in Stockholm. There was a news item on the local television station the other night that Jacob Lykke’s research on preeclampsia had just been published, and it was sort of playing up the idea that research from Yale Medical School reveals important pregnancy complication consequences; women who have preeclampsia have worse health later in life. It also does it, by the way, morphologically. It’s differential imprinting by sex, and it’s not happening during the development of the body in order to decide whether a cell becomes a liver cell or a brain cell, it’s happening in the germ line of the parents, just before the gametes are produced. You can do it by genetically transforming mice, and the gene that you choose to disturb the equilibrium is the gene that does the imprinting. The costs to the mother are coming from selfish, egocentric cognition and behavior, and both mother and child are bearing costs from any of the negative aspects of autistic spectrum. So I want to give you some take-home messages about conflict resolution that come out of the study of genomic conflict. You can do this in a host pathogen relationship by shifting the transmission from horizontal to vertical. Conflict is much more easily evolved and experienced in sexual organisms than in asexual organisms."
202,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-11,"Life history covers three main classes of traits in organisms: age and size at maturity, number and size of offspring, and lifespan and reproductive investment. Organisms must make tradeoffs among these traits that typically cause them to come to evolutionary equilibrium at intermediate values. Life history traits are evolutionary solutions to the ecological problems of the risk of mortality and the acquisition of food, and they are expressed in reaction norms that determine the particular traits that an organism will exhibit when its genes encounter a specific environment during development.You may view the Yale Galapagos site at: ","Okay, today we’re going to talk about life history evolution, and life history evolution deals with some big questions. So you can see that just by comparing some numbers and looking broadly–and this is a typical thing that happens in comparative biology, it’s one of the neat things about it–if you look across the Tree of Life and you see how different things live their life histories, you’ll immediately start to ask questions. And this concentration on genetics then, in its own turn, elicited a reaction. So the intrinsic factors then can be looked into, and we find phylogenetic effects, developmental effects, genetic effects, physiological effects; all sorts of things. But they can also occur in many other ways. Now with–I’m going to show you one way to do this. However, these advantages of delaying maturity are counter-balanced by the advantages of having a shorter generation time, and you can only get a shorter generation time if you mature earlier. And you can see that interestingly the age at maturity is pretty strongly peaked; the fitness profile has a peak that’s pretty close to one value. We’ll see such an experimental study later on. And the way I want to do that is by dealing with some incredibly blockheaded strategies. And so just intuitively you might think that there is some kind of intermediate compromise so that when it is not being fed as much, it changes both its age at maturity and its size at maturity. This is what that model tells us about human females. The nineteenth century women were poorly nourished. This should be the best, which she naturally does, and we perturb that, she should have less fitness. Baby gets hungry, mommy and daddy work harder. Mommy and daddy work about eight hours that day–daylight’s about sixteen hours a day in the summer in North Holland–and they hit a rate of physiological output which is nearly four times basal metabolic rate, which is what Lance Armstrong puts out on the Alpe d’Huez in the middle of the Tour de France. Okay?So that introduces parental survival. In , T.S. Eliot wrote, “Birth, reproduction and death. So if an adult has survived to some intermediate age, and juvenile mortality in that species is pretty high, then the adult represents a relatively improbable event that’s quite valuable, and if it’s making babies in that environment, each of them has a relatively low chance of surviving to be that big and that old, and therefore there is a certain fitness advantage in investing in the preservation of that adult, because it’s unlikely that you’ll get another one up to that state. And the numbers were set up to give you a nice simple output. And it shows you that after the age of 46, evolution doesn’t care if you’re there anymore, from the point of view of getting grandchildren. And neutral effects early and negative effects late is called the mutation accumulation hypothesis. This is extremely discouraging for the organisms that have consciousness and the ability to analyze a situation."
203,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-12,"Sex allocation is an organism’s decision on how much of its reproductive investment should be distributed to male and female functions and/or offspring. Under most conditions, the optimal ratio is 50:50, but that can change under certain circumstances. Sex allocation determines what sexes sequential hermaphrodites should be at each part of their life as well as how simultaneous hermaphrodites should behave. Some species have more control over the sexes of their offspring than others, and adjust the sex ratios of their offspring depending on the environment and conditions.","Okay, today we’re going to talk about sex allocation theory, and I would like to begin by reminding you of where we’re at in the course. So there are some very basic questions about sex allocation. What should we expect to see in a population that has separate sexes? And then there’s the interesting issue–and by the way, this is something I stuck in here this morning, so those of you who have printed out your PDFs, this is new–when should differential investment in offspring of each sex depend on social status? He was very powerful mathematically, but Fisher essentially saw things geometrically that most people see algebraically. So you increase from the other direction. There are many other ways of determining sex. Crocodiles and turtles do it with temperature. So if the percent increase in fitness through one sex is greater than the percent decrease through the other sex, this mutation will invade, and that will go on until a new equilibrium is reached. But the fitness advantage switches to being a female when you’re large, if there aren’t social interactions, because a big female can make a lot of eggs. So in Thalassoma, the bluehead wrasse, that’s a case where they are born as females and then they change sex and turn into males, and when people first started doing experiments on this, they went out and they pulled the dominant male off of a reef, and the dominant female basically started behaving as a male within twenty-four hours, and within about six weeks she has changed color and she has changed the physiology of her gonads and she’s turned into a male and she’s functioning and producing sperm and mating perfectly successfully as a male. If it gets much bigger than that, then the females actually are just wandering around foraging, looking for food, and a female could wander down to this end, and if there was an initial-phase male down at this end, he could grab copulations, because there might be disruptions, as they go up at sunset, and that the number of females would have arisen to the point where the dominant male couldn’t control all of the initial-phase males. So basically the idea is that if the reef is small, these guys do well. So this is some field data from Panama, and it shows you what proportion of the males are actually initial-phase males. And this axis down here is 1/square root of local population size; so actually populations are getting bigger in that direction, along this axis. And by the way, the existence of sequential hermaphrodites leads us to certain puzzles. We’ll get into that with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis. Females in these circumstances are the limiting sex. Now high ranking females in red deer do give birth to more sons than daughters. And what Voland showed is that the probability that a son or a daughter would survive to maturity was dependent upon the economic cycle, pretty much in the same way that we just saw for the chimpanzees. However, what one can say is that that’s perfectly consistent with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis."
204,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-13,"Sexual selection is a component of natural selection in which mating success is traded for survival. Natural selection is not necessarily survival of the fittest, but reproduction of the fittest. Sexual dimorphism is a product of sexual selection. In intersexual selection, a sex chooses a mate. In intrasexual selection, individuals of one sex compete among themselves for access to mates. Often honest, costly signals are used to help the sex that chooses make decisions.","It’s 200 years since he was born, on the same day as Abraham Lincoln. But today we’re going to talk about sexual selection. When he saw all of these extravagant behaviors, he thought there must be something else going on, besides natural selection, and that’s because Darwin thought that natural selection, in some sense, was the survival of the fittest. This is from all causes; this is from external causes; this is from internal causes. And usually males have greater reproductive potential, females have lesser reproductive potential; so males compete and females choose, generally speaking. You’ll see that there are interesting exceptions. And these genes for preference and genes for attraction come together in the offspring, and that has very interesting consequences. Right at the end I’ll show you a couple of very beautiful polyandrous birds where females hold harems of males, and their morphology has been changed so that in those species of birds they are the bright, dominant, colorful ones, that look like males. This is a case in which the sex that is choosey changes in a plastic fashion as a function of how much food they have, and that’s because in Katydids males contribute nourishment to the females in their spermatophores. So that’s actually a nice test case, because here you’re taking the same individual organisms and changing them with an experimental manipulation between two different courtship modes; and it gets directly at this idea. And during that three months he doesn’t eat. Okay?So organisms should be careful, but not too careful. So this business of being choosey is constrained by time. This is a Bird of Paradise and this is a peacock. This leads into something that you may enjoy looking at. What female pheasants appear to be looking for are red irises around the eyes of the males. And that is where the Fisherian process of sexy sons would start. So if he’s really good at finding high quality food, he can make a bigger orange spot. So it’s advertising his foraging ability. So that gene for foraging ability comes together in the offspring with the gene for the preference, and because the male has better foraging ability, the gene for the preference will hitchhike on the reproductive success of the gene for the foraging ability, and females will develop stronger and stronger preferences for a male with orange spots. But they still can, they can still make orange spots. Now the idea here is that the male can’t evolve out of a frequency range that the bat can hear because the female’s eardrum is constrained to be a certain size; that’s the sensory bias hypothesis. I told you that I would show you some polyandrous birds."
205,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-14,"Speciation is the process through which species diverge from each other and/or from a common ancestor. There are several definitions of species, most of which focus on reproductive isolation and/or phylogenetic similarities. This can cause some controversy. Speciation can result from geographical separation or ecological specialization. There are stages of speciation in which organisms cluster first into distinct populations before finally becoming different species.You may view the Yale Galapagos site at: ","Okay, today I have put up a slide from the first lecture, just as a signpost and landmark to make sure that you’re oriented on the path through the course. Ernst died a few years ago at the age of 100-and-something. So there are all kinds of reasons for separation to start. These are actually put in place through recognition molecules. And there is an interesting–gamete biology is very interesting. So there are post-pollination and post-insemination mechanisms of isolation. So hummingbirds are notorious among pollination biologists for loving red and yellow, and if you see a white flower, you can normally–it’s a pretty good bet that it’s going to be pollinated by a moth or a bat. And what they’re trying to do essentially is get the most general and useful definition that they can. And here are a few criteria that could be applied to any concept. So we need a different word to reflect the history of relationship. So that’s why these distinctions have been drawn. If you were to refer to the Old World Euphorbiaceae and the New World Cactaceae, among the plants, as being in the same group because they look the same, you would be wrong, because they both have–they’re actually fairly distantly related from each other and they have converged on Cactus-like forms, and they have closest relatives that don’t look anything like a Cactus. And the criteria aren’t the same as concepts. At any rate, the point here is that if you look back to try to find the last common ancestor of different genes, or different alleles, it’s quite possible that that last common ancestor for the genes will be deeper in time than the last common ancestor of the species; and that’s because species have lots of genes. And of course I’ve shown you that that reproductive isolation can occur at three different stages. So it would be first post-zygotic isolation; then post-fertilization isolation; and then finally pre-zygotic isolation, with recognition that the two things are different. And you might think–and I think this is probably the case–the parts where the exchange is still going on are the parts that aren’t having big impact on hybrid inviability or mate recognition. So when reproductive isolation is complete, then all of the genes are free to diverge. That’s things like how fast does the male vibrate his wings?And Stage 3, which is about here, is between simulans and mauritania, and here we’re starting to get back maybe 500,000 years, something like that; and here we’re starting to pick up lots of sterility and inviability or female sterility genes, and changes in genital morphology so that lock/key mechanisms are incompatible. And then finally when you get this divergence here, which is back at one to two million years, basically you just see a lot more genes in these categories; sterility and inviability accumulate. Now pushing experimental evolution from questions of microevolution into questions of macroevolution is not easy, because by definition macroevolution describes phenomena that are taking place over longer periods of time. So this is a circumstance in which there is a different ecological habitat; there are different foraging and sensory specializations that are needed in the deep habitat than in the shallow habitat. So these things are a good example of stasis. So first, evolutionary biologists have come up with a bunch of different species concepts."
206,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-15,"The Tree of Life must be discovered through rigorous analysis. Genetic information is crucial because appearances can be deceiving, and species that look similar can prove to be genetically very dissimilar and not share recent common ancestors. Two criteria, used to determine what the “correct” Tree is, are simplicity and whether the tree maximizes the probability of observing what we actually see.","So today we’re going to talk about phylogenetics and systematics, and the lecture has this kind of structure. It provides a very basic structure, the structure of relationships. I believe this simile is largely the truth. And homoplasy, or convergence, is similarity for any reason other than common ancestry. It’s got turtles, lizards and crocodiles in it, but it doesn’t have the birds. This is the monophyletic group–lizards, crocodiles and birds–and we don’t have an everyday language term for it. So if we were to define the birds and the mammals as a group, it would be a false group, because phylogenetically the birds have many things which are more closely related to them than the mammals do. So you can look for molecular homology that way. Those are things that were buried in the DNA sequences, that were not apparent in the morphology, and they are not only testimony to the power of molecular systematics, they are testimony to the power of natural selection to change the shape of things in ways that are profoundly altering and create all sorts of is-impressions about relationship. So evolution took something that looked like that and turned it into that. So these are actually deeply cool plants. So the take-home point is that appearances are deceptive and detective work is needed. I will go into this issue with a full slide, because this is a key point; the characters that give you phylogenetic information are the ones that everything in a group shares with each other, and it’s different from the ancestor. So at that point on the tree it becomes useful as a shared-derived marker, of a group; which is why, one of the reasons why, we’re pretty confident that the tetrapods is a good group, and that things didn’t- that the vertebrates didn’t come out of the water multiple times. means shared;  means derived; and means trait. And what is shared and what is derived, and therefore what is informative, depends on the context; it depends on the part of the tree that you’re sitting in. Okay, now a little bit about building trees. They could be morphological; they could be molecular. And we have three species and we have three characters; and in this case ancestral is going to be 0 and 1 is going to be derived. So here are all trees which are consistent with this character matrix. I would like to point out that there probably is not enough data in the world to do that, for all of the creatures on the planet. Next time we’ll take these methods and see how we can infer history with them."
207,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-16,"We can use methods of genetic analysis to connect phylogenic information to geographical histories. Human migration has left genetic traces on every continent, and allows us to trace our roots back to Africa. Molecular genetic methods allow us to determine whether or not trait states were ancestral, which can have profound implications for fundamental biological ideas.","Today we’re going to talk about these phylogenetic trees that we’ve been discussing for the last couple of sessions; and this completes the three introductory lectures on methods that are used, or basic concepts that are used in macroevolution. The outline is first a bit about looking into time; using phylogenetic trees and looking into geographic history. Well I’m going to show you first what’s happened in about the last 10,000 years, and we’re going to see that in Europe the agriculturists spread out from the Middle East and squeezed the Celts into the northwest. So there are lots of neat details in this book. My son, for example, is in a relationship with a woman from here. And you can actually lay down, on this plate, how long ago it was that that island was actually sitting down here. And that’s nice, because when we then do phylogenetics and we start putting phylogenetic trees onto this map, it gives us some feel for when in time those different branch points might have been. Interestingly, you can see that they all moved down from Kauai onto the younger islands. Now what about issues–I’m running through a series of issues that can be resolved using comparative methods in phylogentic trees. There are parasitoid wasps which can be either ectoparasites or endoparasites. And they have relatives who are endoparasites. So if you lay the traits onto the tree, and you are confident of your tree, you can reconstruct the history of an important trait like this; and that’s a nice kind of insight to be able to have. Or you could take something like the twig form. And then these other things all evolved from that. But if you then give them longer to evolve, you go further out on the phylogenetic tree, you compare things between families, where that contrast is possible, then you start to see them moving off the one-to-one line, and the ones that are shade-tolerant have seeds which are falling quite a bit–not all; this is an exception–but quite a bit above the line. These are the Procellariiformes, the Tubenoses. So this is the deviation in adult life expectancy from an overall mean, for the whole group, and this is the deviation in mate fidelity from an overall mean. And these are things that have been selected, probably through frequency dependent selection, in co-evolution with diseases. Given that, now tell me, are you surprised that we can trace all the mitochondria, in all the females on the planet, back to one woman, living in East Africa about 220,000 years ago? By the way, the same thing has been done for the Y chromosome. So it’s no surprise that it goes back to one person. And this method that Joe Felsenstein worked out for independent contrast is something that will control for common ancestry, and it can reveal the correlated changes in two or more traits that have taken place since branches in the tree."
208,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-17,"The history of life and evolution has been characterized by several key events. These events can be grouped as new hierarchal levels of selection coming into play, as biological units coming together in symbiosis and specialization, or in a number of other ways. Other important events are situations of conflict resolution or information transmission, from the genetic to the cultural level.","Okay, we’re in the middle of the section on macroevolution. And this is the structure of the lecture. Gosh, I went through this thing yesterday and I got all the words on it, and then I start talking and they’re not there. The Big Bang is now dated at about 13.5 billion years. So the universe, as we know it, is a big younger than I had thought a decade ago. And at that point the earth had short days; it was spinning very rapidly. So there was a hot high-pressure acid around a positively charged mineral surface. And there are a lot of such chemical reactions. So that would certainly give them an upper hand in competition. So one way out of this problem of the invasion of mutants is to actually put them into compartments. If it’s open, you have no guarantee it’s going to come back to help you. They are all in the same boat; they’re all in it together. And if you do that, if you make those things and you throw them into water–so you have an aqueous solution–this is what you’ll get. So you get a precise and organized way of making genetically different offspring in each generation. And in order to do that, in order to lose the cell wall, you need something to stabilize it on the inside, and that’s the cytoskeleton. Some of the cytoskeleton is actually involved in cell wall synthesis. You might want to have a chromosome of intermediate size. Okay, now the other thing that’s going on in the eukaryotes is they’ve got these symbiotic organelles that were originally independent bacteria: the mitochondria, the chloroplasts, and possibly the spindle apparatus. So one thing that we notice when we look at the chloroplasts in the mitochondria is that the chloroplasts have a much bigger genome than do the mitochondria, and the mitochondrial genes have been transferred into the nucleus. If you’re constructing all of the mitochondria out of essential elements that are in your nuclear genome, you’ve gotten control over them, in a way, and you are making them all look the same, rather than mutating and possibly having the option of creating a runaway mitochondrial cancer that would destroy your metabolism. One is that the genetic code is actually different in the mitochondria and in eukaryotes and in the nuclear genome and in the chloroplast. And it looks like they evolve from host proteins. Those are all principles of conflict resolution, because if you are in a tightly spatially organized system, where your own welfare depends directly upon cooperation with another thing in that system, and your system is in competition with some outside system, and the performance of your system is actually a direct function of how cooperative you are, then there is strong selection for integration, within that group. And next time we’re going to look at major events in the geological theater, and so the lecture next time is more for people who like firecrackers on the 4th of July, and the clash of meteorites."
209,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-18,"Geology and climate have shaped the development of life tremendously. This has occurred in the form of processes such as the oxygenation of the atmosphere, mass extinctions, tectonic drift, and disasters such as floods and volcanic eruptions. Life, particularly bacteria, has also been able to impact the geological makeup of the planet through metabolic processes.","Now today we’re going to be talking about some of the major events in the geological theater. This kind of process continued with other sorts of elements. That screens ultraviolet light and that drops the mutation rate, and it’s probably only because the mutation rate dropped significantly with an ozone layer that we could evolve large long-lived organisms. There are a number of ways of looking at this. So in our early environment, the sun was only about 70% as hot as it is now, and by about 500 million year ago it was up to 95%.The early environment of the earth was a meteorite bombardment. Okay?The heat flow out of the molten mass forming the core of the earth has tended to drop off and stabilize. At about 27%, wood will catch on fire spontaneously, at current atmosphere pressures. Temperature, we don’t really know accurately what the temperature was back before 3.5 billion years, but we can be pretty sure that at and after the origin of life, water was liquid on the surface of the planet; so that sets an upper limit of 100 degrees Centigrade. And that mountain range was formed when Pangaea formed, which is at around 550 to 600 million years ago, and caused the Taconic orogeny, and that put up a mountain range on the border between Connecticut and New York that was about as high as the Himalayas, but it didn’t have any forests on it, and it had a very high erosion rate because there weren’t plants to stabilize the soil. Okay, so those are all aspects of how life has modified the planet. So Pangaea was a little bit earlier than this; that was when all of the continents were together. That was a big lava flow; filled up a big rift valley. And this is what is thought to have accounted for some of the similarities in the plants that you find in the Appalachian Mountains and in China. Remember that in the Permian, Gondwana is still together. Well the Permian is at 250; about 251 I think. And I think it’s really cool that you can find rocks, from Africa, that were scraped off by the glaciers and deposited in Brazil. We’re living today in a relatively cold, relatively dry world. You can go into the middle of the Sahara Desert and you can see rock paintings that humans made there, where they’re recording hippopotamuses and things like that, living in the middle of the Sahara, at this time. So this is about a 30 kilometer wide meteorite. If you look with geological probes under water, you can see the rim of the crater. This is a distance here of about 200 miles across. I’d now like to do a little bit of local catastrophe–this is on a more frequent timescale–just to convince you that sometimes, on a shorter time period, conditions are quite unusual. As a property owner, you have to kind of wonder what you’re sitting on."
210,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-19,"The fossil record holds a lot of evolutionary information that can’t be seen on shorter time scales, although the more recent fossil record is more complete. Among other things, the fossil record demonstrates that extinctions can open up ecological space for new speciation and radiation, and that life forms tend to begin small and evolve to be bigger over time.","Then today we’re going to take our third look at the history of life on this planet, and it’s going to be about the fossil record and the major groups of life. And then if we take everything after the Cambrian–it’s called the Phanerozoic; that’s this column here–and we blow that up, and you can see it falls into the Paleozoic, the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic, with all of these eras in it. And so, for example, the disappearance–the trilobites appear in the Cambrian and they disappear at the end of the Permian. And roughly speaking the world restocks itself with biodiversity in the Paleocene and Eocene. And a lake, or an inlet, dried up and the salts in it crystallized and they perfectly preserved the algae that were in it. So this is again 20 million years before the Cambrian, and the implication that there might be a Crustacean 20 million years before the Cambrian is a very interesting one, as you’ll see in a minute. I just want to remind you that the Tree of Life has these three big groups in it, and we’re now going to blow up this part of it. There are a few things that were running around, in these oceans, that we don’t have anymore. Okay?So the things that we get in the Cambrian are at least three of the mollusk classes. We start getting arthropods; so we get the trilobites. And we know, from the first fossils that we can get of things like Amphioxus, that if you have a tiny, little, one-inch long, translucent, tadpole-like, fish-like chordate, that’s the ancestor of the vertebrates, it’s probably not going to fossilize. And if you want to reproduce on land, rather than in the water–which is, of course, what many of the amphibians have continued to do–then you’ll need an egg that won’t dry out. So it might have been that, just like with computers, the young were showing the old which way was up. So there are wonderful things that are represented in the plant radiation. So this is really kind of a tetrapod recapitulation of what we saw with the ammonites. The Diptera, the flies and the mosquitoes, are a young group, and they are still producing new species. It’s not connected to South America or to Asia, at that point. You’re looking basically at a landslide that buried a lot of stuff. It really places a very relative view on the current world. They run basically from Pennsylvania up to about Vermont. And one is basically a selectionist explanation for stasis. It says that most of the things that we’re talking about have some method where either a larva or a seed can find the environment in which the adult will do well. Basically the larvae have been wandering around the planet, searching out the environment in which the adults will grow up, for hundreds of millions of years; and we know that marine larvae are extremely good at this. Adaptive radiations have been creating little things and big things. It shows us a lot of stuff that we couldn’t see at shorter time scales. So it may be that you need an extinction before you can have a big radiation. So the fossil record has a take-home point, that’s actually a puzzle that can be attacked experimentally, in part by people doing evolutionary developmental biology and phylogenetics, and that is, why is there stasis?"
211,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-1,"The lecture presents an overview of evolutionary biology and its two major components, microevolution and macroevolution. The idea of evolution goes back before Darwin, although Darwin thought of natural selection. Evolution is driven by natural selection, the correlation between organism traits and reproductive success, as well as random drift. The history of life goes back approximately 3.7 billion years to a common ancestor, and is marked with key events that affect all life.You may view the Yale Galapagos site at: ","One of them has to do with how the process occurs, and that’s called microevolution. But the patterns of macroevolution are also very important because they record the history of life on the planet and they constrain the current process. Then we’ll do macroevolutionary principles. So all of those are part of how we can analyze the history of life on the planet. Okay, now by the time that Darwin published his book in 1859, people thought that the world is very, very old; how old they weren’t sure. We now know about four-a-half billion, but at that point, based on the rate of erosion of mountains and on the saltiness of the ocean, assuming that the ocean had been accumulating salt continuously, and that it hadn’t been getting buried anywhere, which it does, people thought hundreds of millions of years. Malthus said basically that populations grow exponentially but agriculture grows linearly. Therefore populations will always outstrip their resource base. He saw very clearly how powerful reproduction is at generating exponential population growth. He went off and he worked five or six years on barnacles. If there’s no variation in reproductive success–for example, if there is lifetime monogamy and a one-child policy, there will be zero-variation in reproductive success if everybody just has one child; of course some people will still have zero, but that’s about as close as you can get. Or it’s as loud, if you like, as a Boeing 747 taking off from a runway. There’s another kind of a bat, called a Noctilio, hunts fish. They knew exactly how dark it had to get before they were safe. They were catching the fish within a meter of us. Now there are a couple of things about that story that I think, uh, I’d like to underline. I had heard about it in a course at Yale. And to a first approximation, a lot of DNA sequences have been shaped by drift. It could just be a byproduct of something that was going on, basically from the mouth up. And there’s a real deep issue here of how do we infer the tree? Those are basically physical and chemical explanations. And there is a pattern in biology that unites biology with geology and astronomy, and that’s history. Now think of your mother’s mother’s mother. Now this means that not only does the tree of life connect you to all the living things on the planet, but the origin of life connects you to the entire universe."
212,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-20,"Coevolution happens at many levels, not just the level of species. Organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts serve as good intracellular examples. Other living things make up a crucial component of an organism’s environment. Coevolution can occur in helpful ways (symbiosis) and in harmful ways (parasitism). Many factors can influence coevolution, such the frequency and degree of interaction.","I stuck this slide up, sort of outside the framework of the regular lecture, and I did so just to indicate that if you go through the scientific literature, you can probably find a neat case of coevolution, with some kind of beautiful biology in it, coming out every week. And today and Monday, we’re going to talk about coevolution and evolutionary medicine as two areas in which micro and macroevolution interact in generating explanations of things. So that things that are happening down at that level are driven by high frequency interactions. So there’s been a lot of evolution at the level of intercellular metabolism. And then this new more or less well integrated unit has a performance. That performance can vary among units, and therefore natural selection is starting to act on the new unit. So at the formation of the eukaryotes, when the mitochondria came in, you had a new unit, and then it was going to perform with respect to other such units, depending on how well the mitochondria were adapted to the nuclear genome; and that’s a coevolutionary process. They can feminize male hosts, in pill bugs–so Armadillidium, the little pill bug that you can find turning over logs–it’s an isopod and a crustacean–and when Wolbachia gets into Armadillidium, basically it takes males, and it has developed a method of interfering with its sex determination process and development, so that anything that’s got a Wolbachia in it will grow up to be a female. Baby aardwolves grow up with milk, from mom. And what you see here is generation time for things that have about the same generation time. So we have a host and a parasite that have roughly the same generation time. So actually what’s going on–I’ve actually misphrased that a little bit. So this thing has evolved into all of these other things, depending upon where they are, in Africa. This is a Batesian mimic of all of these distasteful models. This is a Batesian mimic of all of these distasteful models; and so forth. So this giant clam and the coral are both farming algae. The dynoflagellates, which by the way look like this when they’re out in open water; they’re really quite lovely. They put a lot of it into their calcified skeleton–so basically you’re looking at where reefs come from; this is how a reef is produced–and then they lose quite a bit to respiration and to the mucus that they produce in their feeding. Okay?Now the crazy thing about this system is that a baby coral has to acquire the algae in each generation, and the algae exist as independent species. And that’s very interesting because from the point of view of the algae, the free-living form is the source and the domesticated form is a sink; and it’s therefore puzzling to see how it was that the corals were able to engineer the algae. The fungus can’t reproduce sexually, in the colony, and it looks like it’s been asexual ever since it was domesticated. And it evolved in Asia, and it came into Europe through human invasions, repeatedly. And by 1890, it had crossed the Sahara, and gotten into Southern Africa. And so like pussycats chasing balls of twine, they had gotten into knocking over bicycles and eating people, and there had been thirteen people who had been killed in the two months before we arrived, in Queen Elizabeth National Park. It’s not just species that are coevolving with each other; it happens at many scales."
213,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-21,"Evolution plays an important though underutilized role in medicine. Evolution guides how our bodies respond to various treatments, how pathogens will respond to treatments, and how pathogens’ responses will change over time. Pathogens oftentimes will evolve to an intermediate level of virulence where they become strong enough to infect a host and reproduce, but not so strong as to kill the host before it can spread the pathogen.","Well today we’re going to talk about evolutionary medicine. We can view cancer as an evolutionary process. Every cancer is its own little microevolutionary process. And this is what I chose: I chose Mismatches to Modernity. Perhaps they used to be good predictors, or perhaps those early life events were correlated well with the environment in the Pleistocene, for ten or fifteen years, something like that. These are not necessarily the ones in which this kind of nutritional stress early in life would be very frequent. So when we look at this kind of data, there’s a lot of this that probably really isn’t due to the thrifty phenotype hypothesis. So not all of it, but probably a significant component. So that’s the kind of evolutionary argument that gets at it. We can see that autoimmune diseases are actually exploding. So there are some spatial correlations that are suggestive. I’ll show you some data that are tighter than this. When they send their eggs out, to get into another host, those eggs are going into an extremely risky environment, and it’s not very likely that any single individual egg is going to make it. What we have to do is we have to down-regulate our inflammatory response, in the presence of worms, so that we don’t damage ourselves; because inflammatory responses turn out to be one of the most damaging parts of degenerative disease. But what I’m trying to do is I’m trying to indicate to you that this issue of autoimmune diseases arises logically, either at the points where the worms had been manipulating signaling in the immune system, and then that has been withdrawn, or it is operating on the screening mechanisms that are built in for the immune system; both could be going on. And then they have infected it with various kinds of worms to see whether or not it is changing the T-cell bias in a way that would be plausible to basically down-regulate autoimmune disease. And what you can do is you can breed these things in the lab–I’ve seen them in Rick Maizels’ lab in Edinburgh, growing in a little vial; they’re whipping around in the little vial; they look like little pieces of thread–and basically you use their eggs. There’s a lot of info that can be stored in 10 bacteria. But it also indicates just how important the widespread agricultural use is. And when the cynical researchers checked the claims to the health insurance companies, they discovered that the actual number was probably ten times higher than that. It’s been in humans, we think, about seventy, eighty years, something like that. And that’s been used to produce the Sabin oral polio vaccine; the measles, mumps, rubella, yellow fever and chickenpox vaccines; one flu vaccine; and a TB vaccine and a typhoid vaccine. What you do is you get a nice genetically homogenous mouse, which is not going to be any kind of a genetic challenge to the parasite. And that really creates an ethical or public health dilemma, which is rather similar to antibiotic resistance. Hundreds of millions of lives would probably be saved."
214,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-22,"There is a distinct possibility that humans are currently part way through an evolutionary transition between individuals and groups. The conflict between these two units of selection and levels of organization, between biology and culture, may explain some of the tensions in modern human life. Examples of selfishness and altruism exemplify how these types of selection act on humans.","Now, today I am giving a lecture, on which you’re not going to be tested. And in 2005/2006, after I finished being chair of the department, Yale very kindly gave me a full-year sabbatical, and I spent the year reading widely in how evolutionary thought had impacted psychology, anthropology, political science, economics; all of these cognate fields that have something to do with human behavior, and that bear on the issue of whether or not we have been selected to behave in certain ways in social contexts. I think it’s perfectly valid to do what I’m doing today. But I don’t think it would be responsible for me to go out and publish a book, in the general trade industry, that made the central claim. The pain is caused by the fact that there is a conflict between individual interest and group interest, and that conflict has not been resolved, and the selection mechanisms that have been pushing us in that direction are starting to break down. The British continued to attack until winter. Okay?Another great tradition, Confucianism. Has the breakdown left us in a state of tension, caused by conflicts between individual and group? And do these individual group conflicts define a significant part of the human condition?You know, once you’ve seen that list, it’s easy to start telling just-so stories, and throwing up lists of things: unions in conflict with management; Democrats in conflict with Republicans over the role of the individual and the role of society in constructing government policy; Communism versus Capitalism; the way I feel about whether or not I should donate to a charity or keep the money for my wine cellar. So if you were living in a state in which the opportunity to reproduce was in fact determined by the group and not by the individual, that would probably be a pretty strong signal that you had completed the transition. The strength of selection, in part, is going to be determined by the rate at which units are born and die. Well that’s benefited everybody in the group, at my cost. If there is any selection for people who behave that way, who go around going, “Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,” that will actually accelerate the spread of social norms, and rapidly make them uniform, within groups. And so Troy was burned down a total of about fifteen times. How does something like that propaganda spread through a group? Well we have–and this is one of the places where perhaps biology is providing a handle for culture–we have a number of learning mechanisms. One of them is to copy the successful, the dominant, the frequent. You can punish defectors; that’s the punishment of violators of social norms, altruistic punishment. In this particular species, the cost imposed by group membership is that you can’t reproduce, if you’re a female, so long as the dominant female’s in charge. So this defection is a recipe for the creation of a failed state. And it goes in as a river and it comes back as a little line on the page. And when you think about that, you think about deference, patriotism, empathy, trust; where do those emotions come from? There’s been lots of good psychological studies on this one; we have a frightening impulse to conform. It shows, as the current economic crisis just shows so clearly, that we are now globally integrated by economics."
215,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-23,"While there are many differences between modern science and philosophy, there are still a number of lessons in modes of thought that scientists can take from philosophy. Scientists’ ideas about the nature of science have evolved over time, leading to new ideas about falsifiability, creativity, revolutions, and the boundaries and limits of what can be accomplished by different types of science.","Okay, so today what we’re going to talk about is the logic of science. Now science is basically culture’s answer to the big problem of epistemology, which is how can we know anything at all? And the fact that it’s just done so, for a long time, is no guarantee that it will do it again. But that’s quite different from just sitting there, without having that model of the universe in your head and noting that the sun comes up every morning, and just accumulating instances. Now the part of knowledge that people can agree upon, through this debate of alternatives, is what we call science; and that means that somebody else can replicate your claim. That means if you’re reading a paper, for one of your papers, and somebody can’t tell you clearly what they’ve done, they’re not doing a good job. So that is one of the reasons that I’m so enthusiastic about people learning to write effectively, because it can actually accomplish cultural transformation. But often there are several different selection pressures that will result in the same outcome. So proof means true at all times, in all places. This is philosophy of science, this isn’t what we really do.” And that’s because we can’t do experiments. Nevertheless, we can do observations that are so precise that they become convincing. You’re just going to measure the fine structure constant and if it measures down to that many decimal places, you’re going to scratch your head and say, “Well, you know, I think maybe the theory has got something to it. So that kind of change in world view he described as a scientific revolution. And the idea here is that the paradigm shift is so profound that people are not able to communicate across the divide, so that once you have seen, for example, that the continents are in motion, you can actually no longer have an intelligent conversation with your geological colleague who doesn’t realize that yet, because it’s such a deep change in the way that you look at the world. So taking the current state of science, what Kuhn might call boring, normal science, and pushing its limits and discovering where they break down is probably the most effective way, in the long-term, to really cause major scientific advance. And there are insights that those guys have had, some of which I think should be part of the intellectual equipment of any well-educated person. And particularly among that crew I particularly admire Foucault because Foucault, for example, discusses things like is the definition of madness a function of the current power structure of society? They’re mostly much smaller than a paradigm. And then parts of it become mature, and they have then significant elements that are no longer subject to debate. The first thing that goes off is math, then physics. They only happen to those who have prepared themselves by working hard."
216,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-24,"This lecture provides an overview of the physical aspects of earth’s biomes. Temperature, water, latitude, and altitude all come into play. Regions with similar levels of these climatic features tend to have similar life-forms living there. These same climatic features can also affect weather patterns, which in turn affect life by altering habitats and ecosystems. On a large enough scale, such as El Niño, these weather patterns can affect life all over the earth.","We’re now going to start the block of the course which is on ecology, and these are the titles of the upcoming lectures. So at this scale, this stuff I think is probably pretty familiar. The rising air is going to be cooling before it condenses. And the cooling is going on at a rate of about 6 degrees Centigrade per kilometer of elevation, going up. Okay?So this warm air falling here is called foehn in Switzerland, and the Swiss always complain that it gives them headaches; it’s called the Santa Ana wind in Los Angeles; and there’s a special wind that blows down the valley behind Lahaina, Maui, that can hit 140 miles an hour sometimes, which is similar. That would be what would happen if the earth were not rotating. At the equator the diameter of the planet is roughly 8000 miles; so the radius is about 4000 miles. So in between–basically it’s a trigonometric function that’s telling you what’s the diameter of the spinning object as I go north. It’s called the Coriolis force, and it’s shaping the direction of major ocean currents, and it’s also shaping things like the trade winds; and you’ll see in a minute that it shapes the way that hurricanes spin. Because if it doesn’t remain stable, and this moves south, then the Gulf Stream will get blocked and basically England, France and Spain are going to end up with a climate which is like that of Northern Canada; very quickly. Now there are just–I want to show you two things about the general pattern. I think El Niño actually is an extremely interesting and neat phenomenon. And, by the way, they call a year that’s sort of really super normal, La Niña. And if any of you live on the West Coast, I think you know this perfectly well, because you know that very often the water on the shoreline of the West Coast is colder than the air, and it is going to produce fog. Ecologists have broken the planet down into areas that basically look similar from the structure of their ecological communities, and are thought to be similar in terms of the general control of ecological processes. And one tends to find deserts at about 30 North and about 30 South. And remember, this is where you have cold air falling. So here are the things I want you to remember about climate; organisms and the climate machine of the planet. I’d like you to remember the pattern of winds and currents, from the equator to the poles."
217,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-25,"Every species on earth has an environmental range in which it can live. Usually it flourishes in the central portion of this range. Organisms contain a host of adaptations that allow them to manipulate their environments to remain within their preferred range. Plants and animals differ in the nature of these adaptations, which include the control of water, temperature, pH, and ion concentration.","Last time I discussed the planet as a basically physical and chemical machine, and how climate affects temperature and water and nutrient relationships on the planet, both on the continents and in the ocean. So what we’re doing here is starting off with Claude Bernard, the great French physiologist who came up with the idea that one of the basic things going on in organisms is that they’re trying to keep their inside constant, while the outside changes; the idea of homeostasis, .And well then I’ll briefly mention L.J. Henderson, who said, “You know, it’s extremely interesting that the properties of important things in the environment, like water and air and the molecules out of which organisms are built, and things like that, are in some cases extremely convenient for life.” It serves very effectively as a medium in which a huge diversity of chemical reactions can occur, out of which life has selected some of them, and so forth. And one way to think about that is that evolution has designed organisms to extend the range of environments in which they can survive and reproduce, and therefore that the definition of what is critical in the environment has been continually changed by evolution. Because the organisms themselves have been defining what these things are, as they evolve. So what it’s done is it’s allowed its body temperature to go up to 44 degrees Centigrade. And then right about now they’ll come out again. And then they will arouse, eat and then do it again. A very bad idea to try to take the body temperature of a sleeping brown bear. So that’s basically why you get these rough limits. Okay, now what about evaporative water loss? So that’s another illustration of physiological ecology. So this basically is the water which is available to the plants. Now I don’t know if any of you have ever stood on the edge of a pool and tried to suck the water from a swimming pool up a tube which is only as tall as your body; okay, less than 2 meters. And the question is, how do they do it?Well the transpirational pull is being caused by the water that evaporates inside the leaves. So if we go back to this, you should think of water that is going to evaporate and go out of the stoma–and it’s coming off of these cells right here, next to the xylem and the phloem–and it will cause, as the water is evaporating from the stoma, it will cause the water surface in the stoma to pull back into pores in the cell walls–well it’s not from the stoma, it’s actually from the cell, inside the leaf–and there it will form kind of a concave meniscus. And actually liquid water is this beautiful set of sheets of these layers of molecules that have formed these bonds. If you go out now and you’re doing work in the short-grass prairie, or in the long-grass prairie, for that matter–Mindy Smith works in the Kanza Prairie in Kansas, and in South Africa–and you do a section through the soil, you can see that a lot of the life of plants, and a lot of both their individual ecology and their competitive relationships with other plants, is actually being mediated by where their roots are foraging for water. And, in fact, what they’ll do is they’ll suck the water table down to where they will kill off any competitors, because they’ve just made a desert out of the upper layer of soil. This is salinity down here and temperature over here. So you should think of these things as changing through evolutionary time."
218,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-26,"The growth of populations is held in check by several factors. These can include predators, food and other resources, and density. Population density affects growth rate by determining how likely is it that an organism will interact with a member of its own species compared to an organism of a different species. Population growth studies rely on the mathematics of logs and exponents.","Population growth is one of those things in ecology that is good to get kind of an intuitive feeling about. Yes–the basic point that I want you to get about compound interest is that it will very rapidly produce a whole lot of stuff, and that the rate of multiplication is quite a bit faster than the arithmetic difference in the interest rate. You will have to look up a few numbers on the Web; they are readily available. I think you’ll be surprised, it doesn’t take very long. So you can divide 69 by the growth rate to get the doubling time; divide it by the growth rate in percent to get the doubling time, for any process. So X keeps track of age and T keeps track of time. So a life table is an accounting tool, and frankly life tables are a bit like natural selection in the following way; they actually do imply a kind of natural selection, but that’s not the point I want to emphasize. If you have a life table for humans–you might be interested in knowing will there be enough people around, who are young, to pay for your Social Security when you’re old?–you can use this procedure to do so, and that’s what demographers do with it. And this is how the population will develop. Half of these survive, half of these survive. So that means like the ratio of five-year-olds to ten-year-olds remains constant. And I’d like you to note that R0 is calculated on a different time period, generation time, than little-r. So when big-R0 is equal to 1, little-r is equal to 0, and the population is then–the word is used, stationary; it’s just replacing itself. And this is the demographic process that basically leads to constant final biomass. So if you go on, all the way through to harvest, you’re going to end up with about 100 plants per square meter, and the–by the way, the way that plants regulate their individual growth, you essentially get the same amount of leaf area or root area covering a square centimeter of ground. The number of seeds per plant, number of flowing plants per quarter square meter; the number goes down. You’re starting to get a few big ones and lots of little ones; that’s what this kind of histogram means here, lots of little ones and a few big ones. Okay?Now this is something that was going on, by the way, in those trout experiments; you were getting a few big ones and a lot of little ones. So the more competition there is, the greater the skew will be between lots of little ones and a few big ones. So that means that competition is producing an asymmetry, and this asymmetry, where you have a really skewed size distribution, just basically means that a few individuals are going to be doing most of the surviving and reproducing, and a lot of individuals are going to be doing most of the dying, and not reproducing. This is a direct tie now between population dynamics and natural selection. And the problem was that they had thought, because he was so clear, that they understood everything."
219,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-27,"Competition among species, or interspecific competition, can have an even greater effect on selection than competition within species (intraspecific competition). This is often the case in lower density populations. Different species can have positive, neutral, or negative effects on each other’s fitness, and the effect species 1 has on species 2 is not necessarily the same that 2 has on 1. The effects that cohabiting species have on each other shapes evolution the same way that selective pressures from within a species or the physical environment shapes it.","Today we’re going to talk about inter-specific competition. This particular one is about biological interactions in communities. So here, for example, species 1 might be benefiting–its effect on species 2 is positive. So that if you say, “Hey, this has been caused by competition,” you’re making an implicit assumption about how strong that those relationships are. So again a very suggestive pattern, but not confirmed by experiment. Now, those sorts of patterns led Evelyn Hutchinson to suggest this kind of view of why we find so many species on the planet. This is mean higher water; this is mean lower spring water; this is mean lower normal tide range. Chthamalus is a little guy, and what Chthamalus does basically is it gets a refuge up in the dry part of the upper intertidal. Another famous set of early competition experiments were done by Gause. So they were more or less throwaway lines for him. So what they’re basically saying here is this. So what we have done is we’ve created a phase space. And as you add in species 1, by increasing the numbers out here, it is reducing the density at which species 2 reaches its carrying capacity and its zero growth rate; which is why this line is pointing down here, this line is pointing up here. These are the four possible outcomes of competition between two species. And what you see here is that species 1 is able to grow at higher densities, across the entire range of densities of both species, than is species 2.In this intermediate area, between the two lines, species 2 is above its carrying capacity and it’s dying out. We can tell that by remembering to look for which axis has the K2 on it. And there are about 17 species of fruit flies that can live on the same fig tree; the same fruit from the same fig tree, in Panama, and it’s very probably because the process I’ve just described is guaranteeing that intra-specific competition will be stronger than inter-specific competition. This selection couldn’t work unless there were genetic variation among individuals in each species."
220,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-28,"The idea of ecological communities has changed tremendously over the past forty years. The classical view stated that there were so many different species because evolution packed them tightly into the available niches. The modern view emphasizes the idea of trophic cascades, or top-down control in food chains. This emphasized the importance of predation in ecology, although it downplayed the significance of food webs, which showed the interrelated nature of ecosystems better than simple food chains.You may view the Yale Galapagos site at: ","Okay, today we’re going to start talking about ecological communities; and this builds on our prior discussion of competition, predation and disease. And it is one of the aims of community ecologists, out of this complexity to pull a few take-home messages that they can apply broadly. And from that he gets a measurement when allopatric and a measurement when sympatric; and basically the summary of all of this is that species differ more when they’re living together than when they’re living apart. And in particular it can interact with competition. Stan Dodson was a sophomore when he helped John Brooks do this paper. And there he could remove starfish from the intertidal, and he did so sort of in blocks in the intertidal. And remember that big things take longer to mature, and small things mature more rapidly. And as a Ph.D. in this department is currently showing, it actually alters, … the presence of the fish in the lake, causes an induced response in the life history of the zooplankton, and the induced response, which is basically that they shift a lot more energy into reproduction–not of growth, because they’re going to get hammered by the predator–that causes them to reallocate their fat reserves in such a way that the ratio of elements in their bodies changes. By the way, this is an image taken off of the web, which is in the public domain. I have seen every edible tree defoliated to the height of a saddle horn. And if you have some grasshoppers that prefer to eat one kind of grass, but if the spider is particularly good at foraging on that- in that kind of habitat, and you introduce a spider, then it will cause the grasshoppers to switch onto the less preferred plant, and this actually causes the community to reorganize. So this is from that paper by Carpenter and Kitchell and others. And there are some very interesting ones. So during the last Ice Age, patterns were created in North America that have allowed people to reconstruct what’s going on, and Margaret Davis did excellent work reconstructing the history of the reassembly of the forests of North America, after the ice went off. In particular, the hardwoods came in, in a lot of different sequences. And I must say that this is kind of a rescue process to get this pattern, because these–Hawaii is the extinction capital of the world, and so there are a lot of people who are working to document these patterns before it’s no longer possible. That’s what Bob Ricklefs, the question Bob Ricklefs posed himself. So regional processes really look quite different when you take the map, like a rubber, and just stretch it out, so that things can live in a larger area. There was a refuge up near the Andes in Peru and Ecuador. I think that really the communities are driven mostly by the glacial cycle, rather than by the continental drift cycle."
221,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-29,"Geography is very important in ecology. Two major systems have been designed to model this, island biogeography and metapopulations. The idea of metapopulations is more recent, and has emerged as the dominant theory. Metapopulations are populations in multiple neighboring areas. The population of a species in any individual area may go extinct, but the metapopulation still survives. The theory of metapopulations has gained momentum in recent years because of its applications to epidemiology, the study of diseases.","You guys had a little bit of fun getting dressed up and doing some stuff up on stage last Friday, and so I though that I would actually have a little fun myself. And I was unable, as you know, to decide which section had actually done the best job. I have been told by my teaching fellows that I absolutely have to do it. And a lot of the world is becoming fragmented by humans. Another kind of natural fragmentation, of course, is archipelagos, islands. New Guinea is going to be off here somewhere. What are the fewest things that we have to pay attention to, that will tell us something, a take-home message, some key message, that we can pull out of the system?”And they thought, well let’s suppose that there isn’t any evolution going on, and that all of the species we’re considering already exist on some big continental landmass, and that they’re getting onto islands in a process of immigration, and they’re dying out on islands in a process of extinction. The number of species on the island is going to be affecting the extinction rate, probably in two ways. So they must some ways differ systematically. It’s actually empirically difficult to decide when an immigration has occurred. So you have to actually find the species that breed on the island; that’s not so easy. So the major assumption of the theory, which is that there’s a turnover of species that produces an equilibrium between immigration and extinction is correct. But the observed turnover is often of casual species, not the ones that breed with established populations, and there’s nothing in the theory to tell us what proportion should be in each category. So the theory is a failure; the theory is a failure if the goal is to be right. So we can look at MacArthur as a Dionysiac, a creative enthusiast. Even if every single local population is likely to go extinct, the metapopulation can survive in a balance between extinction and colonization. So they would be asynchronous; and that is often observed. And that’s been observed, at least in one case, for snails living in ponds in the U.K. And that’s done by taking samples of the mud in the bottom of the ponds and going back over many years and looking for the presence of snails. So the butterfly population is in Finland, and the plant population is in Provence; its thyme in Provence. So they move around among pools, on these islands, in places like this; this little island here might have ten or twenty pools on it. If you look at the number of publications per year, using say Web of Science, you can see that interest in island biogeography peaked in the mid-80s and then has declined; it’s not gone to zero, but it’s going down. But, you know, the Aztecs really weren’t–it’s not the only explanation–the Aztecs were not very well liked; this habit of ripping people’s hearts out and eating them on altars hadn’t endeared them to the captives that they got, and the subject peoples."
222,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-2,"Genetic transmission is the mechanism that drives evolution. DNA encodes all the information necessary to make an organism. Every organism’s DNA is made of the same basic parts, arranged in different orders. DNA is divided into chromosomes, or groups of genes, which code for proteins. Asexually reproducing organisms reproduce using mitosis, while sexually reproducing organisms reproduce using meiosis. Both these mechanisms involve duplication of DNA, which then gets passed to offspring. RNA is a key component in the duplication of DNA.","Okay, I’m going to start with an example. So that, just on the face of it, would indicate that maybe John ought to be worried. And so the DNA in your genome is a set of instructions on how to make what kinds of proteins at certain places and times to control the construction of the organism and determine the uniqueness of the species. Okay, genes are in specific locations and they come in different forms. If you are carrying two different versions of the gene–you got one from your mom and you got one from your dad and they’re different–then you’re a heterozygote, and we call that condition the heterozygous condition. If you got the same one from both parents, then you’re a homozygote, and we call that the homozygous condition. Normally a gene has got a codon–that is, three nucleic acids–that say, “This is where you’re going to start reading me off. So the RNA will go out one part of the ribosome, and out of another part will come the growing chain of the protein. Communist China was influenced by Stalin, and in fact Mao bought this stuff for awhile and carried out some similar policies during the Great Leap Forward, in the 1950s, and millions of people starved to death in China as well. So you could throw it out a bit more easily than the Russians could. During replication the ends of the DNA strand are loosened and opened up so that in the notch between the two strands the nucleotides can be inserted. Only one mistake in about a billion nucleotides occurs in DNA. Meiosis is the process that produces gametes. So it takes the diploid parent down into a haploid gamete. So I’m jumping ahead a little bit here to Punnett diagrams. Just make a note in your head that this fact of segregation is the basis for our being able to predict what the offspring will be like if we know what the parents are like; at least it’s part of it. So that’s tracking what happens when you have genes on two different chromosomes that are forming gametes. These are recombinant gametes generated by crossing over. Now mutations are also going on in every generation, and they produce changes in DNA sequences. Some of them make genes that are functional. So one or two deletions can have really big effects on the information content of the whole genome. He could’ve had a mutation in the gene that turned it from a brown into a blue gene, and that could’ve found its way into the sperm that fathered the child; and the probability of that happening is about 10."
223,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-30,"The movement of matter and energy around the planet is very important, and its study draws on geology, and meterology in addition to chemistry. Energy tends to flow upwards from plantlike producers to herbivores to carnivores before being decomposed by detritovores and cycling back into energy usable by producers, in addition to the photosynthesis or chemosynthesis used by producers to produce energy. Like energy, compounds vital to life such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous flow around the planet in cycles.You may view the Yale Galapagos site at: ","Now we’re going to talk about a different kind of ecology. So today what I’m going to do is I’m just going to outline energy flow, cycles of materials and biogeochemical cycles through ecosystems. And people study how energy flows, and so the paradigm basically, at least for things that are in the part of the planet that are driven by the primary productivity of plants, it starts with photosynthesis, and the annual production is usually determined by temperature and moisture; certainly for terrestrial ecosystems. Left out of this description is all of the chemosynthetic activity which occurs in deep, black, dark water at mid-ocean ridges, and which is occurring in the subterranean part of the biosphere that goes down- up to say five or ten kilometers, where there are bacteria that are living deep in the ground. But there’s just so darn much of it that on the planetary scale it’s making a pretty good contribution. Okay, so this is an overall view of energy flow on the planet, at least for the photosynthetically driven part of the planet. So this isn’t a very big number when you look at the solar output. The secondary carnivores are eating the primary carnivores. Any idea what Africa would look like if you got rid of the dung beetles? Why not?As they’re  they’re actually they’re also respiring. If you look at the energy flow for the grasslands and the forests, it’s pretty similar to the standing crop. So this is where the nutrient-rich waters are coming to the surface. A lot of energy in nitrogen; okay, nitrate, powerful stuff. So these kinds of processes actually are part of the substructure of our modern and post-modern culture, and it gives you some feel for an ecosystem service. Why would it be more of a problem on granite than on limestone? And I want to just mention a couple of things about it. So this is an extreme case of that process. So you’re going to have planetary forces generating rainfall, whether there are trees there or not, but you move just 30 degrees north, to the Mediterranean, and you don’t have that. But the critical thing is whether or not at equilibrium you’re just pushing that equilibrium a little bit, because these are rates, and rates accumulate. Look what happens to carbon dioxide between the Ordovician and the Carboniferous. I think there’s an important message in that. Life has dealt with it and will deal with it just fine. You get lakes filled with algal blooms, and that is showing you the dramatic response of–the algal population and plant population in lakes is showing you that phosphorous really is the limiting factor."
224,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-31,"One can look at biodiversity from several perspectives. An ecological point of view tries to determine how necessary diversity is for an ecosystem to function. An economic point of view tries to capture the value of the “services” nature provides for mankind. An evolutionary point of view shows how artificial the human “right” to dominance is. Finally, a personal point of view captures the emotional basis for the values that humans place on biodiversity.","Now today I am going to talk about biodiversity and whether or not it’s something we should be worried about, and how to think about things like the extinction crisis which is being caused by human activity. By the way, let me just take one of Bob’s slides, which he shared with me recently. And that suggests that the easiest way to solve the population problem is not to do anything Draconian, but just to give every woman on the planet control of her own reproductive fate; by whatever means. A richer community appears better able to survive a drought. So there are a whole series of levels at which one can ask the diversity question, and not all of them are equally well researched. And I’m just setting a pointer here, because I’ll come back in a few minutes and point out that if you claim that you need a lot of biodiversity to maintain clean air, clean water, pollination services, everything that Nature gives us for free, but if Nature is really redundant, so that you could actually get rid of 90% of the species on the earth before you even noticed any decrease in ecosystem function, that you are then involving yourself in a political argument which is quite dangerous; and that is that you appear not to know what you’re talking about. So there is a real problem here of being able to communicate to the general public, and the politicians, the issue that you could have a lot of ecosystem redundancy, which is buffering you from the extinctions that might otherwise be affecting ecosystem function, but at some point, if you’ve eliminated a lot of species, you will hit a limit at which there’s no redundancy left, and at that point ecosystems start to collapse. So there have been attempts, mainly by Bob Costanza and his group–he’s now at the University of Vermont–to estimate what is the value of ecosystem function. So if you just make one of those things and put it out into space, potentially humans could colonize other galaxies. So it’s not something whose consequences, whose costs, are reckoned into market calculations. They concentrate their living right around estuaries; Chesapeake Bay, for example. If you want to use a kin selection argument, don’t hold your breath on this one, because we haven’t yet demonstrated that we can behave nicely to other human beings; and they’re much more closely related to us than other species. “The long-term solution requires a reduction in birthrates and radical changes in consumption. Because if we do, there’s not going to be much left to save. And I just want to take a couple of examples out of the book. And the owner of the ranch, where they were still managing to live, Cynthia Salley, she decided that she wasn’t going to let anybody on the ranch who was not really motivated to help save the crow, and so she told the biologists that if they were going to work on her ranch, they couldn’t publish any of the results; and that immediately stopped all activity. So the biologists were interested in their publications as much as, or perhaps a little more than, they were interested in the crows. And the emperor says, “Yes, it is a very important part of our culture, we must preserve it. So for a year or two the army went out and protected the forests. And the political response to trying to get this species listed was really massive. This one little salamander was holding the whole thing up, for the whole continent. So the development was blocked temporarily. There are some advantages in some experiments that show biodiversity is a good thing, but results are mixed, and if you just review all of the biodiversity stuff, on ecosystem function, you have to come away honestly and say, “Well, it’s a mixed bag."
225,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-32,"There are several ways to examine the behaviors of organisms when they forage or hunt for food or mates. These behaviors become more complex in higher organisms, such as primates and whales, which can hunt in groups. Foragers and hunters have been shown to examine the marginal cost and marginal benefit of continuing an action and then adjust their behaviors accordingly. They are also able to handle risk by hoarding resources.","We’re into the last segment of the course. Then I’ll illustrate how two different birds deal with risk. You could either go to this place or you might go to some other place, when you go out to get food. And this is the proportion of eggs that he will fertilize, if he stays on. So it really looks like he was able to get them to tell him which fitness measure they were using while they were foraging. But I think the essential point is that you can do an experiment that will get you to tell you what an animal is actually using as a fitness measure. This is a Great Tit, which is a European form of chickadee, and this is an experiment which is done in an aviary, and this is a variable environment. And as the food starts getting unpredictable, the bird starts getting fat. But there’s another way of dealing with it, and that is that if you look at this other relative of the Great Tit–okay, this is a Marsh Tit; it also looks a bit like a Coal Tit; it’s a little bit smaller, has a black head–and you put it in a high variance environment or a low variance environment, this one, it doesn’t change its weight at all. Well that’s what these are, these warning colorations. Of course it can go in the other direction. These are the light signals which are given out by different species of so-called fireflies–in fact, these are beetles–and they have a light organ, and you can see that there’s a species specific signal pattern. And so there are some that mimic the light signals of another species; some females that are sitting there saying–they’re faking it. So she goes blink, with the signal of the other species, he flies in, and she chews him up. Another reason that we don’t see the hosts throwing the cuckoo egg out is that the cuckoos may be moving on to new hosts. This might be appropriate for another kind of species. And this is a situation that is interesting, both because we can quantify the benefits of foraging styles, and we can see whether or not animals are actually doing what is quantitatively best for them. So these chimps actually have a culture where they teach their offspring how to crack nuts with a hammer and an anvil. So Gombe is Jane Goodall’s study site in Tanzania, Tai is in the Ivory Coast, and Mahaleis a Japanese study site. Just think of how much strategic thinking it requires to figure something like that out. And if you look at the kind of hunt that was involved, you can see interestingly, if you classify the hunts by kind of a primitive, not terribly well-coordinated hunt, which is a half-anticipation, through a single-anticipation hunt, where one of the chimps is actually successfully anticipating where the colobus are going and manages to get over and block them off, to a doubled-anticipation hunt, which is even more sophisticated, you can see that there is a reward in terms of amount of meat eaten for participating in a more sophisticated hunt. The tax that they pay is by sharing what they capture. Well this is the frequency of ambushes that are used by hunters of different ages."
226,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-33,"The economic concept of game theory can be readily applied to evolution and behavior. By analyzing encounters between organisms as a mathematical “game,” important information such as fitness payoffs and the proportions of “strategies” played by each group within a population can be inferred. While oftentimes these games are too simplified to apply directly to actual examples in nature, they are still useful models that help convey important concepts.","Okay, this is the second lecture on behavior. So instead of actually testing these ideas with biology, what I’m going to show you is how biology introduces interesting qualifications to the assumptions of the games. So I’m going to show you that that, in fact, is equivalent to a Nash equilibrium. So those would be the ones that you tested against. The loser doesn’t have to have zero fitness, it’s just what–it’s the increment in fitness which is determined by this particular encounter that we’re talking about. So when a hawk interacts with a hawk, this is its payoff. When it interacts with a dove, this is its payoff. So that one dove will at least be present. Now let’s look at the prisoner’s dilemma. So this is the payoff matrix for player one, this is the strategy of player one, and this is the strategy of player two. And the take-home from that is that if you have what’s called population viscosity, which means that particular individuals tend to encounter each other more spatially than if they’re just randomly mixed up in the population, that promotes cooperation. And the biological examples are not direct tests of evolutionary game theory. And so actually this happens pretty quickly, which is kind of nice; I mean, if you’re doing a behavioral study in the field, it’s nice to have it over quickly so you can get your data quickly. This is some important aspect of biology that alters that analysis. And again it has to do with information, but now it also has something to do with honest signaling and perception. So here are some of the experiments; and so I put up Appearance and Reality. They started barker ferociously at each other. The sexual system–we usually get to the ESS if the genetic system will produce it; you know, will allow it–is you have more genes affecting a trait, it becomes more likely that the population will hit the ESS.If you have asymmetry in the contest, that will–as we’ve seen with the bowl-and-doily spider, and with the size of the contest, size of body size, and with badge size in sparrows and in deer–that will change the outcome. Okay?So the take-home points that I want you to get from evolutionary game theory is that this is a tool, it’s an abstract tool, and it is probably the tool of choice anytime you’re looking at frequency dependent evolution of phenotypes."
227,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-34,"Mating systems and parental care vary tremendously from species to species. Every species differs in how it protects its young from predators and provides its young with food, if it does so at all. The physical environment as well as behavioral dynamics in intraspecies relationships all influence parental care. Often the mating system, which sex is dominant in mating, and whether fertilization is external or internal will determine much of the process of parental care.","Today we’re going to talk about mating systems and the way that they interact with parental care, and a bit about parental neglect, as well as parental care, and parental conflict over care. It’s thought to be on the order of ten to fifteen kilometers. You can provision young before hatching or birth. So if the egg is heavy–and it doesn’t really matter whether it’s the first, second or third in the series–then the probability of fledging is going to be about 80%, and if the egg is small, the probability of death is going to be just about 100%.So this is a herring gull chick, hatching out of an egg. And it has, by the way, spread around the world and is something of a pest, because if you hear a couple of thousand frogs going “coquí, coquí, coquí” all night, you don’t sleep very well. And basically what this shows is the number of lump-suckers that are caught by otters, and you can see that the males, who are defending the nest, have a much higher probability of getting killed by an otter than the females. So they actually get weaned at about 80% adult size. And an adult porbeagle shark is a pretty impressive object. And it’s an interesting theoretical issue to think of how can the payoff in the quality of the one offspring possibly compensate for the loss in numbers of the say ten or fifteen that died in nourishing it?Now another way to nourish young is to have some kind of specialized secretion in the ovary or the oviduct, and that’s the case in a vector of great medical importance, Glossina, the tsetse fly. So it doesn’t feed at all outside the mother. And that is something which is done by burying beetles. So the only thing that the male is providing is display behavior and sperm, and then the female is on her own with the offspring. So sticklebacks, lump-suckers, gobies, things like that. The swans, which are monogamous, and then the dunnocks, which are polygyandrous, are cases where both parents will care for the offspring. With something like a marmote, the harem is basically based–it’s a resource defense harem where the male is sitting on a pile of rocks, and he’s defending his pile of rocks against other males. And the females live in the pile of rocks, and they would live in that pile of rocks if the male was there or not; I mean, they use that as their refuge. And this kind of conflict is won by the mothers in chimpanzees. So this is a case where we have all kinds of behavioral ecology and evolutionary ecology coming together. And we’ll now look at a couple of other cases of reproductive suppression. The dominant female does most of the breeding, and being in the group is quite critical. But exactly how that works depends on the case under discussion."
228,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-35,"Breeding strategies differ both among males and females of the same species as well as among different species. The difference in breeding strategies among members of the same species can usually be linked to frequency dependence. If the species is at evolutionary equilibrium, the relative fitnesses of these different strategies will be identical. Differing strategies have been found at the level of the gamete as well as at the level of different organisms and species.","This first slide really is just an update on the content of my lecture last time, and it actually has two messages; there’s the direct message and then there’s the meta-message. And so she had this nice paper that she’d read on hyenas that showed that actually mother hyenas do intervene in the squabbles between the baby hyenas, and that they do so probably because in some seasons they’re actually able to get enough food–if there are twins born, say that are sisters, that are fighting with each other in the first week of life–to actually rear both of them. So they had to set up two separate ways of making seeds; the ones that the wasps would use and the ones that would make future figs. On the other hand a certain number of the females are going to manage to get out of the fig without being mated inside, and if you can go out and find them, outside, then you don’t have to commit to fighting. So there are three different kinds of parasitic male reproductive behaviors. So they don’t necessarily look like a female. And the pirate males are males that steal fertilization by being big bullies. Okay?Now there are also cooperative male reproductive behaviors. This is a male on his nest, and he is nesting in algae. So this is a big mat of algae, and he has cleared out a hole in it. That’s not true of the female mimics; they know that they’re going to be in sperm competition. If there’s no sperm competition, you’ll get them all. And the number of–if you just go out there, you know, with your mask and snorkel, and you’re writing down how many males are at the nest, what this kind of work does is it tells you that the number of males that you see at the nest actually is a rough predictor of the amount of sperm competition, which is going on. Well this is sperm per spawn, times a million. So what’s actually going on when we consider the alternative tactics of sperm, or the alternative tactics of eggs, and can we actually see alternative tactics reflected at the level of the sperm, as well as the level of the adult?And this is a case in which we can. So the sperm that are produced by males that are adopting different tactics actually have different swimming speeds. And these numbers here are actually years. The male makes a decision after say late in its first year. Doubtless, if you are an adult ocean going male, you are a bit irritated to have these little whippersnappers there stealing your matings from you. So his presence is creating this opportunity for them. Why haven’t I been talking about females?Is it because the males are usually the ones that left. In fact, polyandry is so rare in the animal world that there’s very little evidence for it."
229,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-36,"Originally, altruism and self-sacrifice were thought to be incompatible with natural selection, even by Darwin. Now we have several explanations for how altruism can increase an individual’s fitness. One is kin selection, or the idea that helping relatives can help increase one’s genes in the population. Another involves ecological constraints and punishments. Here, individuals contribute to the group and wait their turn to reproduce.","Okay, I think it’s probably appropriate that the course finishes on this note. And that is calculated as the probability that a gene in the donor and a gene in the recipient are so-called identical by descent from a common ancestor. So an adult female will watch and will give the alarm call. There are quite a few birds in which there are helpers at the nest. And he did this in East Africa, contrasting colonies living on Lake Victoria and Lake Naivasha. Primary helpers are older sibs and secondary helpers are unrelated birds. And the answer is that the helpers inherit the nest sites. They dig a meter-long burrow, which is a lot of effort, back into the cliff–so if you can take one of these over, you don’t have to dig it yourself–and they lay their eggs way at the back of the burrow. So overall, if you look at total fitness of the different kinds of roles that are being played in the population–the breeding birds, the primary helpers, the secondary helpers, and those not helping–and you calculate both direct fitness and indirect fitness through relatives, over the lifetime of the birds–so this takes years to gather; this is a summary of a lot of work–mating is better than helping. Now in social carnivores the situation is interesting because they are cases of reproductive suppression. And when we ask what is the best evidence for this gene-centered interpretation of evolution, we see that wow, there’s some of it from kin selection, and that does seem to work some of the time, although often there are alternative explanations. And therefore I would say that overall this view, that genes really are what evolution is operating on, is pretty well supported. So there has been more or less a tendency, once people learned about kin selection, to try to take the world and fit it into that theoretical construct, and in the process people ignored some simpler explanations. They do better at competing and defending territories against other groups. So here is the hungry bat and the satiated bat. If it got down to here, they would starve and die. And then there is win-win mutualistic cooperation; and we haven’t really gone into that in detail."
230,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-3,"Adaptive Evolution is driven by natural selection. Natural selection is not “survival of the fittest,” but rather “reproduction of the fittest.” Evolution can occur at many different speeds based on the strength of the selection driving it. These types of selection can result in directional, stabilizing, and disruptive outcomes. They can be driven by frequency-dependent selection and sexual selection, in addition to more standard types of selection.You may view the Yale Galapagos site at: ","Today we’re going to talk about adaptive evolution, and that means that today is going to be all about the different kinds of natural selection that there are. It can be neutral, in which case it’s been dominated by drift. So evolution does not only produce things that work well. Now I’m then going to discuss when selection is strong and when it can be slow, and I will tell you something about the rate–the units in which evolutionary rates are measured, and then I’ll run through types of selection. So the number of babies in the first brood, how big the babies were in the first brood, how fast the babies grew, that all changed quickly. The males were less colorful and they displayed more discretely. And the females prefers males who have bright orange spots. However, the male is dancing in front of the female, and that makes him a sitting duck for Crenicichla (Pike Cichlids) And as we’ll see a little bit later in the lecture, sexual selection involves a direct tradeoff between mating success and survival, and these guys were displaying frantically to get mating success, at the risk of being snapped up by a predator, and the ones that survived were the ones that simplified their display behavior. So within 1 standard deviation you will find, on each side, 34.1, or with both 68.2% of all of the individuals observed in the population. So what will happen if you keep a strong directional selection going on finches? If I measure it over this period, it looks pretty fast. This point, the shorter the time interval over which you measure the rate, the higher the maximum rate. But these go on all over the place and some of them are very subtle. And, in fact, we know from the behavior of marine invertebrate larvae–so now I’m talking about worms, barnacles, clams, stuff like that–that they like to settle on places where there are successfully growing adults of their own species. So basically the larvae are selecting the habitat in which the adults will be selected by natural selection. And that’s plausible for certain major features of the body plan, that are determined very early in development, and involve developmental tissue relationships and things like that, that are obviously hard to change. There are several criteria that one sex might use in choosing a mate. Frequency dependent selection is another kind of selection, and that happens whenever the advantage of doing one thing depends on what the other people in the population are doing. It looks like variants, rare variants, have been selected again and again and again. So this principle really has had quite a role to play in the selection of the vertebrate immune system. Now there is some large-scale differential species selection that occurs on the phylogenetic tree, and it shapes patterns at a big macro scale across the tree. Virtually all asexual things are relatively young and they had sexual ancestors. Selection can be strong and the response can be fast, but some traits evolve very, very slowly."
231,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-4,"Neutral evolution occurs when genes do not experience natural selection because they have no effect on reproductive success. Neutrality arises when mutations in an organism’s genotype cause no change in its phenotype, or when changes in the genotype bring about changes in the phenotype that do not affect reproductive success. Because neutral genes do not change in any particular direction over time and simply “drift,” thanks in part to the randomness of meiosis, they can be used as a sort of molecular clock to determine common ancestors or places in the phylogenetic tree of life.","The lecture today is about neutral evolution. One is going to be how meiosis is like a fair coin. The second point is how the fixation of a neutral allele in a population is like radioactive decay; and it’s like it in this sense: in neither the case of the fixation of neutral alleles, nor in the case of say looking at a gram of uranium-238, do you know which mutation will be fixed or which atom will decay. Their usual fate is to be eroded by mutation. So there’s neutral amino acid variation, and finally there’s something which is a little bit more abstract, and basically it’s abstract because we don’t understand it very well–it’s a real phenomenon but we don’t always know what the mechanisms are–and that is the canalization of development. For example, there is a steady process by which viruses of various sorts splice themselves into the genomes of their hosts, and this is part of the adaptive strategy of viruses that they are able to hedge their bets by sticking themselves into a genome and hanging around for awhile and then popping out, at a point which might be advantageous to them but inconvenient for their host. I read an estimate once that the human genome had a substantial percentage of fossil viruses in it. Our last common ancestor with the kangaroo was at about 140 million years perhaps. We don’t know what’s the case, but we do know that canalization exists and we do know it has a consequence; it allows hidden genetic variation to accumulate. All of these things contribute to random change. But a mutation can only cause a change in the inherited set of possibilities. Some wild bandit comes along and highjacks your interests, and now your probability of getting into the next generation is only 20% rather than 50%. Okay, mechanisms that cause random change also occur at the population level. In other words, their immune system finds a sample of skin from any other cheetah in the world to be their own skin. Okay?So that’s what I mean by combining the lottery of meiosis with variation in reproductive success. And this is a process that goes on in all populations. When people are first learning about genetic drift, they think oh, that’s something that happens in small populations, because small populations don’t have all the smoothing effects of the Law of Large Numbers. It allows us to make comparative inferences on phylogenetic trees. The population sizes have fluctuated dramatically. Okay?All the mechanisms of genetic drift are in play here, except meiosis, because flu is a virus, doesn’t go through meiosis. I want you to remember how it is that meiosis is like a fair coin."
232,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-5,"Genetics controls evolution. There are four major genetic systems, which are combinations of sexual/asexual and haploid/diploid. In all genetic systems, adaptive genetic change tends to start out slow, accelerate in the middle, and occur slowly at the end. Asexual haploids can change the fastest, while sexual diploids usually change the slowest. Gene frequencies in large populations only change if the population undergoes selection.","Today we’re going to talk about Adaptive Genetic Change. It’s real easy for you to lay your hands on these tools now. The third thing that I want you to take home from this lecture is that when adaptive genetic change starts to occur, it is virtually always slow at the beginning, fast in the middle and slow at the end. And if I take that glass of pink wine and I pour it together with another glass of white wine, I get even lighter pink. Fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals? There are some interestingly asexual fish. So they use it just to stimulate development. So the asexual haploids are things like the tuberculosis pathogen, blue-green algae, the bread mould, the penicillin fungus, cellular slime moulds, and they constitute the bulk of the organisms on the planet. The scandal is we don’t know how it did it. And by the way, the frequency of the other one is going to be 1 minus that frequency, because p plus q is equal to 1; and we’ll let s be the selection coefficient, which is measuring the reproductive success of the organism carrying this trait, the difference that it makes. And if we look at the genetic change in asexual haploids, basically what one does is make a table of the process; and it is moving from young, in the present generation, through the adult stage, to young in the next generation. These are the possible zygotes that will result from that. Jill doesn’t have any special history of this disease in her family, but that history’s not well known, and so we estimate the probability that Jill carries the disease from the frequency of deaths in the general population, and that frequency is 1%; to make it easier for you to calculate. The probability has to be out of the entire population, and the long-term population, they can’t reproduce–. Right. She has survived, so we have to correct for that. It is more complicated because now we have to keep track of both the haploid and the diploid condition. I made that change deliberately, just so that you’d see it as arbitrary; because we can make S negative or positive itself. Dominance itself is not something that’s always there. If there isn’t any dominance, then the heterozygote is just exactly halfway in the phenotype between the two homozygotes. And that results in a more complicated set of equations. We have basically the adults being p, 2 pq times 1 plus hs. It’s not all ; it’s sort of a complete replication of them, the order. Well all the  Okay, that’s going in the right direction, but I think it can be expressed even more clearly. Why is the trait–let’s do it for a dominant diploid sexual."
233,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-6,"Mutations are the origin of genetic diversity. Mutations introduce new traits, while selection eliminates most of the reproductively unsuccessful traits. Sexual recombination of alleles can also account for much of the genetic diversity in sexual species. In some instances, population size can affect diversity and rates of evolution and fixation, but in other cases population size does not matter.You may view the Yale Galapagos site at: ","Okay, today we’re going to talk about the origin and maintenance of genetic variations; and this is continuing our discussion of central themes in the mechanisms of microevolution. If it’s too high, then all the accumulation of information on what has worked in the past will be destroyed by mutation; which is what happens to pseudogenes that are not expressed. So some intermediate rate is probably optimal. These are some representative mutation rates, and it’s good to have some general framework to think about–how frequent is a mutation? The per trait mutation rate is about 10 to 10. When you were born you had gone from seven million down to one million; you’d lost six million of them before you were even born. So there are very, very different kinds of biology affecting the production of eggs and sperm; females have a mutation screen that males do not. There are three things that the second gene can do. And I’ve previously told you about ascaris. Sugarcane has I think about 110 chromosomes, something like that. So the chromosome number of the species itself evolves, and it can evolve fairly dynamically. And the amount of crossing over can be adjusted. There’s just a tremendous number of different kinds of genomes out there. So that’s 10,500,000 bases, for each of 269 individuals. I am only showing you one tiny part of one chromosome here, and there are actually 650,000 of those blocks that have been identified now in our genome. Because it’s representing many, many different genes, they are occurring at all the different possible places in the genome. The fixation rate doesn’t depend on the population size, and that’s because the probability that a mutation will occur in a population depends upon how many organisms are there. Those things compensate, and the fixation rate doesn’t depend on population size, if you’re looking at the whole genome. And by making the male side of it so small, we have biased the probability that a gene will get fixed according to some process like this. That male side is a really small population. Now this is the normal heterozygote which is susceptible to malaria. Now the real situation is more complicated than this. The equilibrium assumption doesn’t really apply out there in Nature, but it does give us a rough rule of thumb for how much to expect, and as soon as people who have sickle cell anemia move out of areas with malaria, it takes quite awhile for that allele to disappear from the population."
234,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-7,"Development is responsible for the complexity of multicellular organisms. It helps to map the genotype into the phenotype expressed by the organism. Development is responsible for ancient patterns among related organisms, and many structures important to development shared by many life forms have changed little over hundreds of millions of years. Development is expressed combinatorially, allowing a relatively small amount of genetic information to be expressed in many different ways.","Today we’re going to talk about, or we’re going to introduce the role of development in evolution, and I would like to start by asking you to make two jumps in your head. But in every other organism that we know of, with minor exceptions like our red blood cells, all the information is in all the cells, and that means that development is a matter of editing, it’s a matter of determining which information gets turned on in the right place at the right time. Development does a bunch of things in evolution. This is why humans look like chimpanzees. Genetics takes the genotypes of the parents and it transforms the genotypes of the parents through Hardy-Weinberg equations, through the selection that’s operating on them, through all of that stuff that we just looked at quickly. And, in the process, it places limits on what the phenotypes can look like, so that not every conceivable phenotype is going to arise out of the DNA sequence in a genome; only a certain range. So they may go back a billion years; not sure about how far back. There are some big and striking differences among these groups. Mechanistically a lot of this is going on at the level of gene regulation; and this is a recap of the structure of the eukaryotic gene. There is another way to think about this. And we will also see that this kind of concentration gradient is used in the construction of the vertebrate limb. What then happens is that transcription factors are used to define specific areas where only a precise subset of genes is expressed. Some of them turn into the head, some of them turn into leg segments; some of them have extremities, some of them don’t–that kind of thing. And it’s because they are transcription factors–the boxes are found in transcription factors–that this is a very conserved interaction. Because DNA hasn’t changed its structure in three billion years. And this is from a number of years ago; this has probably been filled out now. And you wonder, well how did there get to be thirteen in this family? But logically speaking, giving the signaling apparatus that’s available in the genes, there’s no reason logically that the genes have to be collinear; but it’s a fact that they are, and it’s a marvelous fact that they are. That’s kind of interesting, because it suggests that the mouse has added on some stuff that is in front of the hind brain. Remember when I said at the beginning we have these orders of magnitude of complexity within cells, and these orders of magnitude of complexity between cells. There’s nothing resembling the HOX genes in the way they’re genetically organized. They fall into three groups: the A group, the B group and the C group. They will contain a signature, probably a very interesting signature, of this huge disturbance that has been created on them. The ancestors of currently existing organisms often had an awful lot of the genes that are now involved in controlling development."
235,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-8,"Reaction norms depict the range of phenotypes a single genotype can produce, depending on the environment. Reaction norms must fit within an organism’s phylogenetic constraints. They can differ for different individuals within a population, but some traits differ very little based on the environment; some do not differ at all.","Today we’re going to talk about developmental plasticity and reaction norms, and in the process we are going to complete our assemblage of all of the tools we need to understand microevolution, at least as a first sketch. So this completes our basic understanding of all of the fundamental processes that are operating in microevolution. So today I’m going to define a reaction norm. Then I’ll show you how this kind of immediate, short-term phenotypic plasticity interacts with developmental control genes and phylogenetic constraints, and I’ll do that with the butterfly wing, and we will see at the end that in fact biology is–heh, it’s not surprising–biology is complexly organic, in a very deep way, and we can see that in the butterfly wing example. So what you’re looking at is a series of different phenotypes that are all produced by the same genotype, the genotype is being copied exactly, and in the middle of the summer they are producing these helmets and spines. So if the predator’s not around, you don’t want to make the spine, because it’s costing you babies. By the way, this digenetic trematode is also called schistosomiasis. Charles Darwin spent seven years working on barnacles, figuring out that they were actually crustaceans. These are the ones that have been exposed to water with parasites in it; these are the unexposed controls. And I just chose the example of five digits in many tetrapods, including ourselves, to indicate that you could have three different genotypes, and you could change population density a lot, and the number of digits on the hand wouldn’t change. This is a picture of an Affymetrix GeneChip for Drosophila melanogaster–it’s got 13,500 genes–and what the chip is doing is it’s picking up the messenger RNA, which is being expressed in the organism; and the intensity of light that you see at a given spot is a measure of the concentration of messenger RNA for that particular gene. And if you did that carefully, you would be able to draw the reactions of the expression patterns for all the 13,500 genes in the genome. A reaction norm is a description of how genes are mapped into the phenotype as a function of the environment. Now this is the diversity of butterfly wing patterns that you can get in about ten minutes in the Peabody Museum collections. And you can see that simply by varying the location where colors are expressed, and by varying the size of the different elements, you generate a huge number of patterns. You can even use them to write numbers on wings. And Bicyclus has a number of neat features. Almost everything about the eyespots has a reaction norm, except their location and number. Well it turns out–I’m sorry for this; this is something that I checked this morning and it wasn’t going on. So if you just look at my own body, the parts of me that are extremely old are the fact that I have four limbs and five fingers, and the parts of me that are evolutionarily relatively young are the size of my cerebral cortex and some other aspects of me."
236,ecology-and-evolutionary-biology,eeb-122,lecture-9,"There are several explanations for the evolution of sex and its continued prevalence. One is facilitating the spread of helpful mutations while hastening the removal of harmful ones. Another is expediting resistance against pathogens. Sex does have several costs compared to asex, such as only giving half your genome to offspring, having to find mates, and the risk of predation and STDs. Overall, the benefits outweigh the costs and sex has a firm hold on the majority of the recent branches of the tree of life.","Now before I get going on today’s lecture, which is about the evolution of sex, I thought that I would just share this picture with you, which I took at ten o’clock on Saturday morning. So there’s some weird stuff going on in the way that turkeys make colors. Well the standard explanation for that, which may or may not be true–it hasn’t been tested too explicitly in turkeys, although it has in pheasants and in peacocks, which are both related to turkeys; they’re all in the family gallinaceae–is this is the product of sexual selection, and that what you’re looking at is what the female brain of the turkey finds attractive. They can undergo a recombination event and simply change themselves genetically, and then wait for awhile and divide later. Karyogamy is fusion of the two gametic haploid nuclei. In a large population, if we contrast a large asexual population with a large sexual population, you should think of the vertical axis as being the frequency of a mutation in the population and the horizontal axis as being time, and A, B and C are beneficial mutations that are arising at different places in the genome. There is less genetic variation in the small population. And I think that you can see, if you work through it, that this is indirectly also the cost of having males. And it’s pretty hard to find mates at low population density, which is why we find that asexuality, for example, increases in frequency as we go into the deep ocean. Then if you have anisogamy, in its simplest form, the cost of males is a twofold cost. The reason is that if you think of it in terms of being good for the species because it causes the species to last a longer time before it goes extinct, well the generation times of species are orders of magnitude longer than the generation times of individuals. Then mitosis originated and eukaryotic cell division. So we have to clearly distinguish between causes and consequences of sex. Parasites and pathogens, and the co-evolutionary problem that they pose, are accepted by many now as a major reason why sex is maintained in populations. You can deal with all sorts of ecological situations. There are some repair mechanisms that actually need diploidy. There might be 10,000 of them in your liver cells, but if they’re a small number in oocytes, then they are going to experience drift. One is that they could try and arrange their physiology so that they could make the effects of any mutation more serious. So that’s just what you need to maintain sex. There’s another example from nature that’s pretty well studied, and that’s worms living in snails and ducks in a beautiful lake on the South Island of New Zealand, and the people who get to go study this stuff go to one of the most beautiful parts of the world, where they then put on wet suits and dive into freezing cold water. So anytime this loop can be completed, the worms can stay adapted to the snails and to the ducks. So asex hardly ever has an exactly twofold advantage. The other is this phylogenetic distribution of asex."
237,economics,econ-159,lecture-10,"We develop three different interpretations of mixed strategies in various contexts: sport, anti-terrorism strategy, dating, paying taxes and auditing taxpayers. One interpretation is that people literally randomize over their choices. Another is that your mixed strategy represents my belief about what you might do. A third is that the mixed strategy represents the proportions of people playing each pure strategy. Then we discuss some implications of the mixed equilibrium in games; in particular, we look how the equilibrium changes in the tax-compliance/auditor game as we increase the penalty for cheating on your taxes.","All right, so last time we did something I think substantially harder than anything we’ve done in the class so far. So what I want to do now is actually do that, do that missing step. By playing P* she’s getting a return of .62. So, so far we’ve shown–we’ve shown just up here–we can see that Venus has no strictly profitable pure-strategy deviation. No hands going up; oh, there was a hand up, good. Good, so any mix that Venus deviates to, will be a mix between L and R, and any mix between L and R will be a mix between .62 and .62 and hence will yield .62. I can’t have a room full of non-sports fans. Raise your hands if you’ve been watching the baseball playoffs. We don’t see it well anticipated by sports commentators. It seems to be that the expected return when this great base runner attempts to steal a base is roughly the same as the return when they don’t attempt to steal the base. If he is randomizing that means that the returns will be equal. I mean suppose I can’t keep track of every single pitch, I can’t actually observe all these fast balls, where will I see the effect of all these extra fast balls in pitching and from the stretch, in the data? Actually there’s still quite a lot of talk, but there was a lot of talk then about the placement of machines to search the luggage that goes onboard. It was pointed out at the time, this has changed since, there weren’t actually enough machines in the U.S., on the day after 9/11, to search every single bag that went into the hold. You’d hear discussions of the following type. That would have been hopeless–not entirely hopeless–but not wise. So we figured out last time that they were going to try and go on a date and they had arranged to go to the movies. And we know in this game, we know what the pure strategy Nash Equilibria are, so no prizes to be able to spot them. So how are we going to go about finding this mixed Nash Equilibrium in the game? So to find the Nash Equilibrium Q, to find the mix that David’s using we use Nina’s payoffs. If she goes to the Rep then her payoff is 1 if she meets David, sorry, need to be careful, let’s do it again. So here we have Nina assigning 2/3 to going apple picking, which in fact is her more favored thing and 1/3 to going to the Rep. Okay, so we just used the same trick as last time, let’s check that this is in fact an equilibrium. So it’s probably better here to think about this not as people literally randomizing but these mixed strategies being a statement about what people believe in equilibrium. I’m not going to ask them what they, well maybe I will, but for now I won’t ask them what they did. Let’s look at the auditor’s payoffs first of all. Now the auditor is not so happy if she audits your parents when they’re honest because audits are costly. The auditor is really unhappy if she fails to audit when the parents cheated. So our claim is to make the auditor exactly indifferent between whether to audit or not, it must be the case that 2/3 of the parents of the kids in the room, are going to be paying their taxes honestly, which means 1/3 aren’t, which is kind of worrying, but never mind. How do I work out the equilibrium probability of being audited? They may be doing that, I’m looking at the parents and I don’t think that’s what they’re doing. Let’s redraw the matrix, so here’s the game - 2, 0, 4, -20, 4, 0, 0, 4 audit, not audit and pay honestly or cheating. Tax compliance, remember that was our P–no it wasn’t, sorry, it was our Q. The only way we’re going to figure this out is to work out, so let’s work out the new Q in equilibrium. The probability of audit will have changed. Let’s just check it, to find the new P, I need to look at the taxpayer’s payoffs and the taxpayer’s payoffs are now 0, –sorry, if they pay their taxes honestly then they get 0, and if they cheat they get -20 with probability P and 4 with probability 1-P. If they’re mixing, if some of them are paying and some of them are not, this must be the same, and I’m being more careful than I was last time I hope, this gives me 24 P is equal to 4 or P equals 1/6. But a different kind of change is we could have changed, sorry,- we changed the payoff negatively to being caught cheating."
238,economics,econ-159,lecture-11,"We discuss evolution and game theory, and introduce the concept of evolutionary stability. We ask what kinds of strategies are evolutionarily stable, and how this idea from biology relates to concepts from economics like domination and Nash equilibrium. The informal argument relating these ideas toward at the end of his lecture contains a notation error . A more formal argument is provided in the supplemental notes.","So we’re going to do a new topic today, we’re going to talk about evolution. However, in a competitive marketplace, survival of the fittest firms will lead to us ending up with a bunch firms who have low costs and high profits. The analog of a gene dying out is a firm going bankrupt. The first thing I am not is I’m not a biologist. The way we’re going to think about this is we’re going to look at symmetric two-player games. Again, the underlying idea is that relatively successful strategies will grow and relatively unsuccessful ones will decline, I’m not going to write that, that’s obviously the other part of that. Now to keep things simple, I’m not going to do any dynamics here, that would take us beyond the math that you could probably, that a lot of you can do in the class. We all know in this game roughly how to analyze it. All right, so he says cooperate but unfortunately he’s been matched against the nasty uncooperative ant. So the strategy cooperate is evolutionarily stable if this small mutation, here’s our small mutation, disappears and doesn’t turn into a bigger mutation. So the mutants, there aren’t many of them around, but they are also playing against the same mixed population, 1 - ε of the time they’re going to be matched against a cooperative ant and ε of the time the two mutants, the two T.A.’s are going to playoff against each other. This is ES it turns out and they explain why in The Times. So nature can suck, nature can be pretty inefficient. Even though I haven’t proved this here, the idea is exactly the idea of this example, so let’s just try and talk it through. So this is going to be a slightly more complicated example. So suppose there’s an invasion of B, so again the T.A.’s are playing B, everyone else is playing C, and let’s see how these incumbent genes do. So 1 - ε of the time it meets itself and gets nothing, ε of the time it gets lucky and it meets a T.A. and gets a payoff of 1.How about those B invaders, the T.A.’s in the class. C is going to invade B, turns out everything is exactly symmetric here. So in this particular example the invader, namely B, is itself not evolutionarily stable. So let’s pause for a second and just see where we are. So what I’m going to do is, I’m going to show you an example and what our example’s going to illustrate is we can find Nash strategies that are not evolutionarily stable, and the example is embarrassingly simple. Suppose the entire class were playing B. Wake up the guy in the middle and tell him he’s playing B too. B,B) was Nash but it’s not evolutionarily stable, it can be invaded. We call them strict Nash, so it is in fact true, is if (S,S) is a strict Nash Equilibrium, by which I mean S is a strict best response to S, then S is a Nash equilibrium–sorry, S is evolutionarily stable. What I want to do now is I wanted to show you formally how are these connected. But this is the definition that came out of biology. You could think of that saying, this has to be true for all small mutations. It’s also going to be ugly but a little bit less ugly. I say it rose from Maynard Smith but it really comes from Darwin. This is an idea that emerged in Economics in the twentieth century in the 1950s, so roughly 80 years after Darwin. So what appeals to me because I’m kind of a nerdy kind of guy is I think it’s kind of wonderful that those two ideas are almost the same. What I want to convince you of is that this definition, this kind of Game Theory definition, this Econ definition implies the one above. We wrote down these kind of equations several times. So the mutant dies out because she or he meets Ŝ often. The fact that they do horribly against each other causes them to die out."
239,economics,econ-159,lecture-12,"We apply the idea of evolutionary stability to consider the evolution of social conventions. Then we consider games that involve aggressive (Hawk) and passive (Dove) strategies, finding that sometimes, evolutionary populations are mixed. We discuss how such games can help us to predict how behavior might vary across settings. Finally, we consider a game in which there is no evolutionary stable population and discuss an example from nature.","All right, I want to talk about evolution again today but just before I do, it’s hard not to be a little bit happy today because I woke up this morning and heard on the radio that three game theorists won the Nobel prize this morning, which is very nice. So really the only candidate for an evolutionarily stable strategy here is A. So the second thing you would check is: is (A,A) a strict Nash Equilibrium? So one thing you might talk about in the social sciences is the evolution of a social convention. So this is a very simple social convention. We can see that this, this could be an evolutionary game. Conversely, if you drop an unobservant Brit into America and they drive on the right, they’re going to get squashed pretty quickly, so it’s kind of clear why everyone driving on the left or why everyone driving on the right is each of these are perfectly good evolutionarily stable social conventions. So you could imagine that one version of this game, you sometimes hear this game referred to as chicken. There’s no asymmetry in the rows–in the row and column player, although in the handout–not the handout, in the reading packet I made for you–they do also look at some asymmetric versions of games, but for now we’re just looking at symmetry. We have to make this comparison - how does this mix do against all other possible mixes versus how those mixes do against themselves? For example, this mutation may be 100% aggressive, or at least it may be very, very highly aggressively, maybe 90% aggressive or something like that. So I want to argue that the reason this very aggressive mutation dies out is because the aggressive mutation does very badly against itself. What does it mean to have a mix in nature? But there’s another thing it could mean that’s probably a little bit more important. Good, an alternative strategy is to be a male elephant seal who looks remarkably like a female elephant seal. So that’s why I want to get a little bit harder. We’re going to look and ask what is going to be evolutionarily stable, including mixtures now. Seems a nice thing to imagine, but is it going to occur in this game in nature? So we can’t have a evolutionarily stable population of doves, and the reason is there will be a hawk mutation, an aggressive type will get in there and grow, much like we had last week when we dropped Rahul into the classroom in Prisoner’s Dilemma and he grew, or his type grew. The only surviving genes will be the aggressive genes. This could be pretty important for genetic fitness. Because we’ve only considered the case when V is bigger than C. So we also need to consider the case when C is bigger than V. This is the case where the cost of fighting are high relative to the prize in the particular setting we’re looking at. It has to be a symmetric Nash Equilibrium. So this is good review for the exam on Wednesday. So it can’t be a strict Nash Equilibrium. We need to show this but it does in fact turn out to be the case. Not literally, you need to actually do some serious work. Now there’s one other thing you’d like theory to be other than identifiable. And then we can go out and look for it, and see if it’s there, and that’s exactly what we now have. So scratch, bite, and trample are the three strategies, and it’s a little bit like rock, paper, and scissors. So if we added 1 to everything then V would have been 2, but we kept V somewhere between 1 and 2.So this is certainly a game, you can imagine in nature, there’s three possible strategies for this species and the payoff matrix happens to look like this. The payoff of scratch against scratch is what? One is orange; one is yellow; and one is blue."
240,economics,econ-159,lecture-13,"We consider games in which players move sequentially rather than simultaneously, starting with a game involving a borrower and a lender. We analyze the game using “backward induction.” The game features moral hazard: the borrower will not repay a large loan. We discuss possible remedies for this kind of problem. One remedy involves incentive design: writing contracts that give the borrower an incentive to repay. Another involves commitment strategies; in this case providing collateral. We consider other commitment strategies such as burning boats. But the key lesson of the day is the idea of backward induction.","Okay, so I want to set up a new topic today, and to get us started I thought we’d play a game. The hat will then be given to Player II and Player II can look at what’s in the hat and either she can match what’s in the hat, i.e., add the same amount in so 1 if it’s 1, or 3 if it’s 3, or she can simply take the cash. If there’s $3 and she matches 3, she gets back 5 for a profit of 2; and if she simply takes the money out of the hat and puts it in her pocket then she gets how ever much money was in the hat. They’ve left early because they’ve got some great idea which is going to make them millions. There’s actually something in between they could do which is less dramatic than disappearing to Mexico, they could just not work particularly hard, shirk, perhaps join in someone else’s project and just let the money run down without the lender really knowing about it. Second, Player I knows that this will be the case, and the way we dramatized this just now is Player I put the money in the hat, the hat was transported across the classroom with people very honestly not stealing the money to Player II, Player II could look in the hat, could see how much money was in there, before Steven or Nate had to make that choice. So we’re basically getting what’s predicted here out of the game. So this underlies a whole bunch of stuff going on in the economy. So a good question is how might we solve this problem?A lot of you are about to go out and try and borrow money to set up your projects, run your new version of Facebook or whatever. And we want to know how you might solve this moral hazard problem. Again, notice that there might be some limitations to this. I mean I think it’s a good idea, and in general you should be trying to do this, but it could just be that the set up–for Nate to set up his new Facebook and for Steven to set up his new mousetrap factory–they just need a chunk of money at the beginning. The way we’ve designed things so far, our lender–I gave you these payoffs in the game–the lender is going to double her money. So what you could do here is you could redesign the payoffs of this project in the event that it’s successful. So a smaller share of a larger pie can be bigger than a large share of a small pie, not always of course. Now let’s just be a little bit careful here. So what might you be worried about as an investment banker about this deal, about this contract? Oh come on there has got to be more than that. The rate of return is better in the smaller case. Should we worry about the rate of return, the 100% rate of return or should we worry about the absolute return? So CEO’s have huge incentive clauses in their contracts, sometimes in the form of options. Why do they have those incentive clauses in their contract? Particularly in the kind of contracts that have been written about over the weekend with Joe Torres’ contract for the Yankees, which he turned down, is partly perhaps to give him incentives to try and win, but perhaps it’s more to do with sharing the risk among the general manager and the manager of the team if they don’t make it to the playoffs. We’re missing out on something very basic. What is it that our borrowers Steven and Nate can do? Wwhat are most of you going to end up using as collateral if you borrow money? I want to take us back to 1066, what happened in 1066? Conversely, if the Saxons run away then in fact, the Normans will stay and fight because it’s easy to stay and fight against people who are running away. He can either not burn his ships or he can burn them. If he burns them then the game is rather different. How many of you have not seen the movie Dr. Strangelove? Just as in Dr. Strangelove, it’s crucial, and it’s a terrible mistake for the Russians not to tell the Americans that they’ve built this machine. So knowledge here is crucial, knowledge of the other side. And every other node belongs to somebody whose turn it is to make a decision at that node. So the game we’re going to play is a game we’re going to call the “Hungry Lion Game.” The one thing that stands between him and being eaten is that in lion society, the only lion who is allowed to eat the sheep is the head lion, the big lion whose name is Ryan. Write down what you would do if you were our key decision maker, who is Ryan the lion. Let’s ask Ryan the lion what he’s going to do, so Ryan are you going to eat Alex the sheep? I’m in totally the wrong part of the room. So the fourth littlest lion should not eat."
241,economics,econ-159,lecture-14,"We first apply our big idea–backward induction–to analyze quantity competition between firms when play is sequential, the Stackelberg model. We do this twice: first using intuition and then using calculus. We learn that this game has a first-mover advantage, and that it comes commitment and from information in the game rather than the timing per se. We notice that in some games having more information can hurt you if other players know you will have that information and hence alter their behavior. Finally, we show that, contrary to myth, many games do not have first-mover advantages.","All right, so today I want to do something a little bit more mundane than we did on Monday. Or is it an advantage to be able to wait, see what the other firm has done, and then respond? I didn’t manage to get rid of it, never mind. So this is the best response for Firm 2 taking as given the choice of Firm 1. We even know the equation of it–I won’t bother rewriting that. If Q1 chooses this amount then Q2 will choose this amount and so on. We already know what Firm 2’s going to do. Who thinks Firm 1 should choose less than that? A dribbling of hands, and how about less than that? We can look at that just by looking at the picture. That’s what we just said and that’s what? So that suggests that I’m going to produce than I used to produce under the old assumption. How do we know the profits must have gone up? So when total output went up, prices went down, good. So I want to spend a bit of time grinding this out. Now again, for those of you in 115, this isn’t the only way to do it–I’m sorry 150–this isn’t the only way that we could do it, we could also set up a Lagrangian equation, but for those people who don’t know what that is, don’t worry we’re going to plug in today. So we’re going to plug this in, and when we plug it in, we get a right old mess but let’s do it anyway. So this is equal to max with respect to Q1–and notice I’ve got an A - C here and once I take this B inside the brackets I’ve got a–/2–and I’m really going to pray that the T.A.’s are watching me carefully and are going to catch my errors here. Solving this for Q1, I get Q1 = /2B. We’re not done yet. Now we want to go back and solve out algebraically for Q2.I know what Q1 is now, Q1 is /4B.Let’s see how it matches up with the intuition we developed before without using any boring math. So previously Firm 1 and 2 were just setting quantities simultaneously. There’s no reason for NBC to believe that. So for moving first to help you here there really has to be commitment. What decision should NBC make?One thing they could do is–they don’t know it’s Ryan but Ryan has this sort of Murdoch like face, so they might just fire him because he might be a spy–or what should they do here? If you ask the students in the business school how many of them have heard the term, they’ve all heard it. And let me give you one example of a game that neither has a first mover advantage or a second mover advantage, just to convince you that can happen as well. It’s not going to surprise you that one of the things we’re going to learn in this game is that sometimes games have a first mover advantage and sometimes games have a second mover advantage, so I’m giving away the punch line. The players are going to move sequentially. Okay, he didn’t hear what the game is, so we’ll explain the rules again for those people who are sleeping. So you have to pick a pile each go, and tell me how many lines to remove. So if you start off with the piles being unequal as we did both times, for example 3 and 2, then you want to be Player 1. And if they take then one from here you’ve won. It means if the initial position has unequal piles, uneven piles, then you would rather be Player 1: it has a first mover advantage. So I want us to notice two things from this game. You want to figure out what the end game is going to look like, is that right? It’s very easy to see this game if you look at the end game."
242,economics,econ-159,lecture-15,"We first discuss Zermelo’s theorem: that games like tic-tac-toe or chess have a solution. That is, either there is a way for player 1 to force a win, or there is a way for player 1 to force a tie, or there is a way for player 2 to force a win. The proof is by induction. Then we formally define and informally discuss both perfect information and strategies in such games. This allows us to find Nash equilibria in sequential games. But we find that some Nash equilibria are inconsistent with backward induction. In particular, we discuss an example that involves a threat that is believed in an equilibrium but does not seem credible.","So last time we finished up by playing the game of Nim and you’ll remember, I hope, that the game of Nim was a game where there was two piles of stones–we made do with lines on the board–and the winner was the person who picked up the last stone. So here’s the theorem, suppose there are two players in this game, like the games that we looked at last time, and suppose–I won’t define this formally now–but suppose the game is a game of perfect information. I’ll define this later on in the class, but for now all I mean is, that whenever a player has his turn to move, that player knows exactly what has happened prior in the game. Or 1 can at least force a tie, which means Player 1 can play in such a way that they can assure themselves of a tie regardless of what Player 2 does. You’re staring at this thing–you might think, we already knew that we’re looking at games that only have three possible outcomes win, loss, or tie so it doesn’t seem so surprising if you look at this theorem, it says, well, you’re going to end up with a win, or a loss, or a tie. So in Nim actually there’s no tie so we can forget the middle of these, and in Nim, under certain circumstances it is the case that Player 1 can force a win. Which is tic-tac-toe?Let’s have a show of hands here. Who thinks tic-tac-toe is a game in which Player 1 can only force a tie? And there are two or three outcomes: I guess there’s a third outcome if you get into a cycle you could tie. If I write down a tree I can always look at all the paths from the beginning of the tree all the way through to the end of the tree. So let’s start with the easy step and we’ll do it in some detail, more detail than you really need to in a math class. Either it’s the case that one of those branches leads to a win, in which case the solution is Player 1 wins; or it’s the case that none of the branches have wins in them, but one of them has a tie, in which Player 1 is going to tie; or it’s the case that all the branches have loss in them, in which Player 1’s going to lose. So I claim I’m for done for games of length one. Well I claim that the longest path in this tree, from the beginning to the end has four steps. So we can apply it to our claim, let’s assume that the theorem holds for all trees length three or fewer, so that N + 1 is 4 for the purpose of our example. So it’s a game of length 3, 3 <= N in this case. Now I don’t immediately know by staring at it what it is, but let’s suppose it was W, say it was W. And the game down below, this is also a game, and it’s a game of length 2 but 2 is less than 3 as well, 2 <= 3. So we know this has a solution, and in particular, he’s going to choose Up. Let’s all take a deep breath and try and digest this a little bit by playing a game. I’ll leave it up there so you can stare at it. So Noah which rock are you going to remove? Let me get two more volunteers now that everyone has seen it. So let’s make it this time a little bit more complicated. Now people can see what’s going on all right. So on paper–it’s on the board–when you first look at it, this is a perfectly simple game. What’s weird is we know perfectly well that if Player 1 chooses D she’s not going to get to make the choice, the second choice u or d. But nevertheless the strategy has to tell us what she would do at every node, regardless of whether that node actually is reached by that strategy. So one of them is here, so that’s one Nash Equilibrium. But there’s another Nash Equilibrium in this game. It doesn’t correspond to backward induction. The entrant is trying to decide whether to invade this market. So this threat that the guy is going to fight you, this threat is not credible. So this isn’t an accounting mistake, not for accounting reasons."
243,economics,econ-159,lecture-16,"In the first half of the lecture, we consider the chain-store paradox. We discuss how to build the idea of reputation into game theory; in particular, in setting like this where a threat or promise would otherwise not be credible. The key idea is that players may not be completely certain about other players’ payoffs or even their rationality. In the second half of the lecture, we stage a duel, a game of pre-emption. The key strategic question in such games is when; in this case, when to fire. We use two ideas from earlier lectures, dominance and backward induction, to analyze the game. Finally we discuss two biases found in Americans: overconfidence and over-valuing being pro-active.","So this is what we did last time: we looked at a game involving an entrant and an incumbent in a market; and the entrant had to decide whether to enter that market or not; and if they stayed out the incumbent remained a monopolist; and the monopolist made 3 million in profit. But we argued that backward induction tells us that the sensible answer is in and not fight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, Ale? Now how did you know he was going to fight? Way back here–sorry for the guys in the balcony. So we know that in the last market, the tenth market, Ale actually is not going to fight. Therefore, the person who’s the entrant in the tenth market should know that they can safely enter and Ale won’t fight them. There’s a disconnect between what the theory is telling us–backward induction is telling us Ale can’t keep people out by threatening to fight, by establishing a reputation –, and what we actually just saw, what happened, which was Ale did fight and did keep people out, and we know that other monopolist’s do that as well. So to make that idea work I want to introduce a new idea. By bonkers, I mean, with 1%, Ale is the kind of guy who likes to fight. But on the other hand, he just saw this sane, calm, Italian guy fight, as he shouldn’t have fought because of backward induction–fought the entrant in Miami. Now why can’t that be an equilibrium?We’ve just argued that even the sane version of Ale–so this is a sort of slightly more subtle argument so just pay attention a second. But now let’s go back to our tenth market, way back in our tenth market. So either you throw the sponge or you take a step forward. So let’s make sure we understand that, if you throw your sponge and miss the game continues:. I’ll walk forward until I slam the sponge in his face. Now for fairness sake, it’s important that these sponges are equally weighted, and I’m going to weight them–I’m going to put water in them now. If it makes you feel better you can think of this American beer. Chevy has to decide whether to throw or to step. So can we have two women in the class please? Good, same rules, Clara-Elise and Jessica. Do people think that Jessica should throw? If you think she should throw raise your hands. Of course one answer to that is, it’s kind of fun watching the future leaders of America throw wet sponges at each other. No, nobody want to give me a shot at this? How many of you ever watch the Tour de France? So this is a bike race that goes around France. Now the second assumption I’m going to make is: as you get further away this probability decreases. Now I’m going to make one assumption that matters, and it’s really a critical assumption. All right, okay so you have two arguments here, the first argument is maybe the better shot will shoot first because, after all, he has a higher chance of hitting. So what I want to do is, as a class, as a group, what I want us to do is solve this game; and I want to solve not just who is going to shoot first, I want to figure out exactly when they’re going to shoot. So the probability that i will hit at distance D, that’s not that hard, that’s Pi).So this is the key rule, if Chevy knows that Patrick’s going to shoot tomorrow then Chevy should shoot if his probability of hitting Pi, I get just 1. Sorry guys, I’ll use you again in a minute. Okay, people should feel free to ask questions on this, I want to make sure everyone is following. It says: nobody shoots, nobody shoots, nobody shoots, nobody shoots, nobody shoots, nobody shoots, shoot. These guys are miles apart and I want to use them as props. Now it’s Patrick’s turn, and once again, imagine this distance is still pretty large, and there’s two things Patrick could think. In each case, whether Chevy thought that Patrick was going to shoot tomorrow or not, in either case, he concluded he should not shoot today. What should I do if I think Patrick’s not going to shoot tomorrow? The dilemma is: if Chevy thinks Patrick’s not shooting, he should step; and if Chevy thinks Patrick is shooting, he should shoot. Good, the answer to the question is backward induction. So we’re at distance 1, just take a step back. At d* we knew already that Chevy would not shoot if he thought Patrick was not going to shoot tomorrow, but he should shoot if thinks Patrick is going to shoot tomorrow, but what does Chevy know at d*? Give me like two more minutes or three more minutes to finish this up because we’re at a high point now. Now that changes things a bit doesn’t it because we know that the Yale football player is sophisticated, has taken my class, and knows that he should shoot at d*, but the Harvard guy doesn’t learn anything anymore, so they’re stuck. People say, well at least I went down swinging and the problem is: the aim in life is not to go down swinging, it’s not to go down."
244,economics,econ-159,lecture-17,"We develop a simple model of bargaining, starting from an ultimatum game (one person makes the other a take it or leave it offer), and building up to alternating offer bargaining (where players can make counter-offers). On the way, we introduce discounting: a dollar tomorrow is worth less than a dollar today. We learn that, if players are equally patient, if offers can be in rapid succession, and if each side knows how much the game is worth to the other side, then the first offer is for an equal split of the pie and this offer is accepted. But this result depends on those assumptions; for example, bargaining power may depend on wealth.","So today I want to look at two kinds of games and then we’ll change topic a bit. 2 can either accept that division or no one gets anything. But the $5 is better than nothing argument would have argued against making any rejection in this game. Why are we seeing a failure of backward induction in this game? So why do we see so many people in this ultimatum game both offer more, and, more importantly, reject less than small amounts. Why do people think people are rejecting what is essentially money from my pocket, there’s nothing going on here, I’m just giving you money. Maybe people are tying their own outcomes to the other player’s outcomes as well. But particularly in this setting where everyone can see everyone else–even in the lab where people actually can’t see people, but they might imagine that the game is really repeated–you could imagine people trying to establish a reputation. And down here we go to stage two, and in stage two, Player 2 gets to make an offer to 1. So 2 gets to make an offer to Player 1 and now 1 can accept or reject. So that was, I’ve forgotten, Anish right and? So Anish what are you going to offer this time? Okay, so you might have done better it turns out. So if we head into the second stage, we’ll end up being here, and this goes from $δ here to $δ here where these dollars are being evaluated at time one. If we get into the second stage then, by backward induction, Player 2 is in an ultimatum game, Player 2 will be making the offer and Player 2 says: whatever cake is left I’m going to take all of it and you’re just going to get a $.01.So if we get into the second stage then Player 2 will make this offer to Player 1. So the offer you’re going to make is this offer: this is the two stage offer. The thing people tend to get confused about here, I think, is they get confused between current dollars and discounted dollars, so we’re going to do all the analysis here in terms of the first period dollars, dollars tomorrow are going to be worth δ. Let’s keep this picture handy and think about a three stage game. And if this offer’s accepted then we’re done. So what does it mean to say they’re discounting? If we start at the end, we know that the last stage, that’s the third stage of the three stage game looks like what? In the three stage game, the person making the offer makes just enough to get the offer accepted, which is δ times what the receiver would get tomorrow. So if we go to the four stage game now, in the four stage game if the person receiving the offer rejects the offer, then tomorrow they can get $. And this 1 will become a δ, this δ will become a δ², this δ² will become a δ³, this δ³ will become a δ…. And it turns out this is the amount you keep for yourself and this is the offer you’ll make to Player 2.In each case I’ve accepted–Did I make a math mistake? We’ll be a bit more formal, and over here we’ll have [δ + δ] / . We assume that both players were rational. Suppose that one of these players is very, very impatient. When you’re bargaining about a house, or the price you’re going to pay for a house, all these things, you kind of implicitly have this assumption you’re going to end up splitting the difference. So one thing was an assumption I made and the other is actually a prediction. So in this bargaining game, I set it up as alternating offer bargaining, so the image you had in your mind was of haggling. In this game the actual prediction is: the very first offer is accepted. Now what is it about the real world that allows for haggling to take place? In the real world you make offers go to and fro, right? So that lack of information is going to change the game considerably. You don’t know how impatient they are to get away with the cash. So again that seems to be about establishing reputation and trying to indicate how much I want this good."
245,economics,econ-159,lecture-18,"We consider games that have both simultaneous and sequential components, combining ideas from before and after the midterm. We represent what a player does not know within a game using an information set: a collection of nodes among which the player cannot distinguish. This lets us define games of imperfect information; and also lets us formally define subgames. We then extend our definition of a strategy to imperfect information games, and use this to construct the normal form (the payoff matrix) of such games. A key idea here is that it is information, not time , that matters. We show that not all Nash equilibria of such games are equally plausible: some are inconsistent with backward induction; some involve non-Nash behavior in some (unreached) subgames. To deal with this, we introduce a more refined equilibrium notion, called sub-game perfection.","So today we have a lot of stuff to get through, but it’s all going to be fairly formal. What I want to be able to do moving forward is I want to be able to look at strategic situations that combine those two settings. So this is just a standard game of perfect information, much like all the games we’ve seen since the mid-term. Conversely, if Player 1 chose middle, Player 2 could crush Player 1 by choosing up, which gave, once again, Player 2 4 and Player 1 0. So if Player 1 chooses down, Player 2 will observe that, just as we’ve done before in our standard perfect-information games, but if Player 1 chooses either up or middle, I want to capture the idea that Player 2 doesn’t know which of those two choices was made. Player 1 is again choosing between up, middle, or down. And Player 2 once again is choosing here, up or down, up or down, and here left or right. So that’s exactly the same as you have in your notes already, but now I want to adapt this tree to show how we indicate that Player 2 cannot distinguish–cannot observe whether 1 chose up or middle, but can observe if Player 1 has chosen down. So the first formal definition of the day comes off that last example. In this particular game, it’s the case that Player 1 knew that Player 2 was not going to be able to distinguish between up or middle in this tree, and Player 1 knew that Player 2 would be able to distinguish in the left hand tree. Exactly, in this tree you haven’t got the payoffs in, but if Player 2 observes that she has three choices, she knows she must be at the top node. It’s not a sensible arrangement of information sets. So provided that Player 1 remembers his or her own move, she knows where she is. They simply can’t remember what they did yesterday. A more important example, perhaps, is if players of games are themselves institutions. And that shouldn’t be a surprise to anybody here because that’s exactly how we drew trees since the mid-term. I haven’t put the payoffs in yet but I will in a second. She’s either choosing left at both nodes or she’s choosing right at both nodes. But here Player 2 only makes one choice that has to apply to both nodes because Player 2 cannot distinguish those two nodes. Now if we push this forward a little bit harder, we can see why. And Player 2 is choosing between left or right. Now here’s Prisoner’s Dilemma as represented the way in which we talked about games before the mid-term. It tells the player in question what they should do at each of their nodes. It can’t tell me what to do at every single node. So Player 1 here just has two strategies, up or down. Let me start again since that was the wrong notation. Up, down), left) is the same as Up, left, down so it’s going to be (4, 2). (( If Player 1 chooses (Up, down) then Player 2’s best response is to choose right. These two Nash equilibria are inconsistent with backward induction. Now I’m going to show you a different game and we’re going to see again that Nash equilibria is going to get us into trouble. So another example, this time with three players. So I claim that we can model this game as follows. So I claim that there are lots of Nash equilibria, and one of them is the Nash equilibrium (A, up, left). If Player 3 chooses right then Player 2 should choose down. If I’d given you this sub-game on its own, it’s clear that the Nash equilibrium of this sub-game–this game within a game–is (down, right). So this brings us to a new idea and the new idea is going to have two parts to it. So 1 is going to move, then 2 is going to move, and then 1 is going to move again. They prefer 2 to 1, so the sub-game perfect equilibrium here is Player 1 chooses B, Player 2 chooses down, and Player 3 chooses right."
246,economics,econ-159,lecture-19,"We analyze three games using our new solution concept, subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE). The first game involves players’ trusting that others will not make mistakes. It has three Nash equilibria but only one is consistent with backward induction. We show the other two Nash equilibria are not subgame perfect: each fails to induce Nash in a subgame. The second game involves a matchmaker sending a couple on a date. There are three Nash equilibria in the dating subgame. We construct three corresponding subgame perfect equilibria of the whole game by rolling back each of the equilibrium payoffs from the subgame. Finally, we analyze a game in which a firm has to decide whether to invest in a machine that will reduce its costs of production. We learn that the strategic effects of this decision–its effect on the choices of other competing firms–can be large, and if we ignore them we will make mistakes.","So last time we covered a whole bunch of new ideas, and it was really quite a lot of ideas for one class. If Player 1 chooses Up then Player 2 gets to move and chooses between left and right. So you can see that choosing down ends the game, so this many people are still playing the game. Why don’t you guys all stand up, just to get you awake on a Monday morning, everyone’s sleepy otherwise. Raise your hand if you choose down; and raise your hand if you choose up. It’s pretty clear what we should do in this game by backward induction. Those of you who didn’t stand up just now raise your hands. Player 1 is the only mover and they’re choosing either up or down and the payoffs are (4, 3) and (3, 1): and frankly we don’t really care at this point what Player 2’s payoffs are because Player 1 is the only person who’s playing in this sub-game. Since Player 1 is the only mover they’re choosing between up and down, and the payoffs are (4, 3) and (3, 1), and of course Player 2 doesn’t get to move so Player 2 is irrelevant here. The reason that these three equilibria have an instruction for how Player 1 should play in the sub-game is because of our definition of a strategy. Maybe what I can do if I just remove this comment, I can work on the right hand board, that’ll allow you to look at it. Okay, so let’s now look at the next sub-game, and again, we’re going to work from the back. And this is slightly, slightly cheating because in fact, Player 1 of course knows what Player 2 is going to have done by the time she moves, but never mind it’ll do for now. up, left) is an equilibrium so this is okay. Then we looked at the slightly more complicated sub-game, the pink sub-game, and we found that equilibrium number 2 prescribes the behavior (up, right) which is not Nash in this sub-game. But being forced to write down those redundant moves is useful because it allows us to model what other people think you would have done at those later nodes. So being able to write down everything in a strategy allows us to have everything in front of us and makes that analysis simple; and that’s exactly what we did here. Good, can we get some mikes to Nina and David actually? I’ll go on talking while I’m doing this–. Where’s David, and Ale can you get a mike to Nina? And Jake’s smarter than me at this: he’s actually good at matchmaking. All of you have sat next to other people at some point. So the classes he thinks of sending them to–he says go to a large lecture class. So this is our game and we’re going to analyze this game, but before we analyze it let’s try and play it. And 2 was choosing between Gaddis and Spence. So if Nina is choosing Gaddis then Dave chooses Gaddis. So the pure Nash equilibria in this game are essentially (Gaddis, Gaddis) or (Spence, Spence). In this case, rather than writing that long piece, this is just equal to 1. So this is another equilibrium in the sub-game. We could go back and put in the P and the Q, but it isn’t too unintuitive, it has Dave going more often to the lecture course that he would prefer all other things being equal; and it has Nina going more often to the lecture course that she would prefer all other things being equal. You guys were lucky because Jake chose the other equilibrium. In a minute what we’re going to do is we’re going to consider a change in this game, but before we do that let’s just remind ourselves what the Cournot equilibrium of this game would look like. So the quantity here, the Cournot quantity is a million tons each. So this is a classic thing that you might be asked in your interview for Morgan Stanley next week. So I think the accountants would do this. How many people think you should not rent the new machine? So if you rent this new machine, you’re producing a million tons a year, it’s going to save you $.50 a ton. And .7 is bigger than .5, so you should not rent. So .5 is less than .7 so don’t rent the machine. Or in 150 for that matter, is that correct?So notice in this picture we can actually see the accountant’s answer, the boring answer. We’re still playing Cournot competition, here’s our Cournot diagram with qA and qB. So prior to making this investment the model is symmetric. This is the old one and this is the new one. It was the effect of the other firm or other players changing their behavior."
247,economics,econ-159,lecture-1,"We introduce Game Theory by playing a game. We organize the game into players, their strategies, and their goals or payoffs; and we learn that we should decide what our goals are before we make choices. With some plausible payoffs, our game is a prisoners’ dilemma. We learn that we should never choose a dominated strategy; but that rational play by rational players can lead to bad outcomes. We discuss some prisoners’ dilemmas in the real world and some possible real-world remedies. With other plausible payoffs, our game is a coordination problem and has very different outcomes: so different payoffs matter. We often need to think, not only about our own payoffs, but also others’ payoffs. We should put ourselves in others’ shoes and try to predict what they will do. This is the essence of strategic thinking.","If you’re here for art history, you’re either in the wrong room or stay anyway, maybe this is the right room; but this is Game Theory, okay. Think about the motor industry, the motor car industry. Some of you would have been in classes that do that before. Think of this as a bad hair day release form. In addition, I strongly recommend people read, . All right, so why don’t we send the T.A.s, with or without mikes, up and down the aisles and collect in your Game #1; not Game #2, just Game #1.Just while we’re doing that, I think the reputation of this class–I think–if you look at the course evaluations online or whatever, is that this class is reasonably hard but reasonably fun. If you put Alpha and you’re paired with Beta, then you will get an A and your pair a C. If you and your pair both put Alpha, you’ll both get B-. We’ll discuss this in a second, but why don’t we actually record what the game is, that we’re playing, first. This is an outcome matrix; this tells us everything that was in the game. Clara Elise’s reason - what did Clara Elise say? And perhaps, the lesson I want to draw out of this is that right now this is not a game. Right now we have actions, strategies for people to take, and we know what the outcomes are, but we’re missing something that will make this a game. And some of you will perhaps recognize these numbers, but that’s not really relevant for now. If the pair chooses Alpha and she chose Beta, she gets -1. Courtney, so Courtney also gave a reason for choosing Alpha, and it was a perfectly good reason for choosing Alpha, nothing wrong with it, but notice that this reason’s a stronger reason. Actually, so you can still read that, let me bring down and clean this board. It sounds like too obvious even to be worth stating in class, so let me now try and shake your faith a little bit in this answer. One, there’s this magical reasoning aspect, my reasoning is controlling your actions. The grade game and this is not the only example. They don’t clean up those bits of pizza and bits of chewed bread and cheese, but why don’t they tidy up?Well let’s just work it out. The best thing for you is to have the other guy tidy up and the worst thing for you is to tidy up for the other guy. They could say I won’t lower my prices if you don’t lower your prices, and they could put this contract in with the pricy lawyer, who’s taking a day off from the divorce court, and that would secure that they wouldn’t lower prices on each other. How many of you have a written contract, stuck with a magnet on the fridge, telling you, when you’re supposed to tidy up. He probably could have a written contract about tidying up. So we’re going to revisit, if not the Divinity School, at least in people who have more morality than my friends up in the business school. It isn’t just that I got a C; I got a C because she made me get a C, so that moral indignation takes us down to -3.So again, I’m not claiming these are the only other possible payoffs, but just another possibility to look at. Not allowed to abstain: let’s try it again. And the best case scenario here looks like getting a 1 here. But if my pair chooses Beta then Alpha yields -1, Beta yields 1: in this case Beta would be better. It could be that what you want just drops into your lap without you knowing about it. Alpha, I think, is the right answer here but why? So Henry is saying sure I don’t have a dominated strategy. If I choose Beta, if she chooses Alpha she gets 3; Beta 1. While we’re here, let’s just mention that things will get more complicated in a world where I don’t actually know the payoffs of my opponent. So I’m going to have to figure out what the odds are of that in doing this exercise. Are we allowed to say that in class?Let’s be honest here, when we say experiments in the real world in Game Theory–or the ones you read about in The New York Times–the real world when it comes to experiments in Economics really means undergraduates at the University of Arizona. Be aware of that when you’re playing games. I want to play one more game today in the remaining minutes. They would have won five bucks minus five cents for a total of four ninety-five. Okay, so this is a five-dollar note and I’m going to put it–sorry about that again–I’m going to put it in an envelope. I thought we should give it to the guy at the back, who is the moral guy. All right, has everyone put a number down? Rational choices can lead to bad outcomes."
248,economics,econ-159,lecture-20,"We first play and then analyze wars of ; the games that afflict trench warfare, strikes, and businesses in some competitive settings. We find long and damaging fights can occur in class in these games even when the prizes are small in relation to the accumulated costs. These could be caused by irrationality or by players’ having other goals like pride or reputation. But we argue that long, costly fights should be expected in these games even if everyone is rational and has standard goals. We show this first in a two-period version of the game and then in a potentially infinite version. There are equilibria in which the game ends fast without a fight, but there are also equilibria that can involve long fights. The only good news is that, the longer the fight and the higher the cost of fighting, the lower is the probability of such a fight.","Last time we looked at how to apply our new idea of sub-game perfect equilibrium to a whole bunch of games, and our general idea for how to solve the sub-game perfect equilibrium is as follows. And towards the end we learned something interesting. Traffic flow down the tree will form a new equilibrium and you need to consider that in designing your tolls and designing your road system. What we’ll do is we’ll pick two Texans then. So the person behind Alec is going to be Alec’s referee to make sure that Alec is actually saying what he says he’s going to do. Nick is going to write down fight or quit. Let me come down to make it easier for the camera person. I need a different team, anybody from the hockey team? Okay so Ryland and Chris are going to play this. We’ll talk about it a bit, but thank you. So clearly we can see what can happen in this game. So the game ten periods through looks exactly the same as the game did at the beginning, when fighting seemed a good option. If you doubt that go and look at the war memorial in Yale that shows how many Yale American lives were lost, and America was only in that war for about a year. A lot of money can be lost in the case of business wars. Well you’re not going to get the bribe back. So these bribery contests look a lot like this. It could be that national or regional pride is at stack. Eventually, by the end of today, I want to look at the infinite version. And if they both fight for two periods, we have a decision to make about how we’re going to end the game in this two period game, but let’s just assume that what we’ll get here is -C -C and -C -C. We’ll assume if they both fight the game ends and no one gets the prize, just to make life simple. So rather than keep that -C in all the boxes, which it’s going to get boring after a while, I’m going to pull that -C out and just put it in front. Is that clear?So there are actually two–let’s be careful here–pure strategy equilibria, there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria in this sub-game. So here the payoffs are going to be -C plus stage  Nash equilibrium payoffs for Player B. So just to understand what I’ve written here then, I put the same payoffs as before but I’ve replaced that enormous thing that was the second stage of the game, just with the payoffs that we know that we’re going to get in the second stage of the game, if we play Nash equilibrium in the second stage. They are the payoffs I’m going to get tomorrow–and possibly forward in a more complicated case–if, in this case, if we both fight in the first period. So the matrix is going to look as follows: a nice big matrix, 2x2. We’re going to write out the matrix for the case where we’re going to play (Fight, quit) tomorrow. So this is the matrix we’re going to use to analyze the first stage of the game in the case where the equilibrium we’re playing tomorrow is (Fight, quit).And as I promised, we have to do this twice. If you both fight and you know you’re going to play the (Quit, fight) equilibrium tomorrow then you’re payoffs will be -C + 0 and -C + V.And just to emphasize once again, these four boxes we created correspond to the stage 2 Nash equilibrium payoffs, so the continuation payoffs of the game. So the Nash equilibrium in this game is (Quit ).So at this stage, we found all of the pure strategy sub-game perfect equilibria in the game. In particular, no costs are incurred in either of these equilibria. What should I do to try and find a more costly equilibrium? Tthere was a Texan down here somewhere, what is it they set equal to what? I guess the chances that one would quit and the other would fight. Our analysis from before is more or less still intact. The mixed Nash equilibrium in this matrix is both fight with probability P = V /  So now we’re ready to show our new sub-game perfect equilibrium, let’s drag it down. In this two period game, I tried to argue–I’m trying to convince you–that you could get fighting occurring just in equilibrium with absolutely standard rational players: nothing to do with pride, nothing to do with reputation, nothing to do with the fact that these guys are crazy guys who drunk the water in New York and New Jersey, God help them. P. But we get a fight with probability of P going through. We’re now going to consider something, we’ve never done before. But what I want to show you is that we can still solve this game even though it’s an infinite period game. The extra prediction is this, if we look at these wars of attrition, and we keep track of the time in which the–hang on guys don’t rush to the back yet–one more thing."
249,economics,econ-159,lecture-21,"We discuss repeated games, aiming to unpack the intuition that the promise of rewards and the threat of punishment in the future of a relationship can provide incentives for good behavior today. In class, we play prisoners’ dilemma twice and three times, but this fails to sustain cooperation. The problem is that, in the last stage, since there is then is future, there is no incentive to cooperate, and hence the incentives unravel from the back. We related this to the real-world problems of a lame duck leader and of maintaining incentives for those close to retirement. But it is possible to sustain good behavior in early stages of some repeated games (even if they are only played a few times) provided the stage games have two or more equilibria to be used as rewards and punishments. This may require us to play bad equilibria tomorrow. We relate this to the trade off between  and  efficiency in the law. Finally, we play a game in which the players do not know when the game will end, and we start to consider strategies for this potentially infinitely repeated game.","We’re going to spend this week looking at repeated interaction. However, many relationships are repeated. So let’s think about some obvious examples, think about your own friendships. So, in some sense, we need a way to model a way to sustain cooperation and good behavior that forms, if you like, the social fabric of our society and prevents always going to court about everything. Nevertheless, we do have this very strong intuition that repeated interaction will get us, as it were, out of the Prisoner’s Dilemma. So write down what you’re going to do the second time. Why don’t we mix it up, we can play it three times. Okay so the first time Edwina what did you choose? Since these are the only relevant payoffs looking forward, in the last period of the game, we know that there’s actually a dominant strategy. The reason we’re going to get both people defecting is because the last period of the game is just a one shot game. They gave quite elaborate reasons for cooperating: cooperating to establish reputation; cooperating because the other person might cooperate; whatever. Therefore we may as well defect in the first round. But then this employee approaches retirement. So retirement can cause, if you like, a lame duck effect. So again, I’m being careful here, I’ve said it  to have a future. In this game, in the one shot game I hope it’s clear that (A, A) is kind of the cooperative thing to do. They have an information set at the beginning of the game and they have another information set at the beginning of period two. So we’re going to have to see if we can sustain Nash behavior in each sub-game. So in fact, 7 is bigger than 6, so I’m okay and I won’t want to do this defection. In the second period you have a temptation to play C, C even if the person defected on you. But you could imagine games, or see some concrete examples on the next homework assignment, in which punishing Patrick is rather fun for me, and punishing me is rather fun for Patrick, and that’s going to be much harder to renegotiate our way out of. If we’re ruling out renegotiation, can’t we devise a strategy for Prisoner’s Dilemma as well even though it doesn’t have multiple Nash equilibriums?Yeah, okay good, so the issue there is, in Prisoner’s Dilemma, we established in the first week that if we’re not allowed to make side payments, we’re not allowed to bring in outside contracts, then no amount of communication is going to help us. Right, it creates an incentive for people not to repay in the first place. To a lesser extent you’re going to hear that on the debtor side as well. However, from an ex-ante point of view, it creates bad incentives for people to make those loans in the first place; and, in the ex-ante point of view, it created the incentive for people to defect in the first period of that game. If it comes up heads both times the game’s over but otherwise the game continues. And we’ll keep score here: so this Brooke and Patrick. So with those payoffs, even one period the payoff of cooperating twice is the same as defecting once, so it’s better if you can continue cooperating, and the percentage is high enough that it would make sense to do so. Until I realized that Edwina had started defecting. People started off cooperating and I claim that at least Ben–Ben can contradict me in a second–but I think Ben’s strategy here was something like this. What does it mean to be a strategy again? It has to tell us what to do at every information set I could find myself at. Now this is very different behavior–we played with the same players–this kind of behavior is very different, in both games actually, is very different than the behavior we saw in the game that ended, the game with two periods or three periods. Every time we play the game, with probability of .75 there’s going to be a future. We have to mimic the argument we had before. So the temptation here is just 3 - 2 and let’s be clear, this is a temptation today and we want to compare this with the value of the reward minus the value of the punishment, but the key observation is that these occur tomorrow. So since they occur tomorrow we have to weight them a little bit lower. It might be that we are impatient to get the money today. In each of those periods you’re going to earn 0, so this is just 0.Which leaves us with a messy bit: what’s the value of cooperating forever?"
250,economics,econ-159,lecture-22,"In business or personal relationships, promises and threats of good and bad behavior tomorrow may provide good incentives for good behavior today, but, to work, these promises and threats must be credible. In particular, they must come from equilibrium behavior tomorrow, and hence form part of a subgame perfect equilibrium today. We find that the grim strategy forms such an equilibrium provided that we are patient and the game has a high probability of continuing. We discuss what this means for the personal relationships of seniors in the class. Then we discuss less draconian punishments, and find there is a trade off between the severity of punishments and the required probability that relationships will endure. We apply this idea to a moral-hazard problem that arises with outsourcing, and find that the high wage premiums found in foreign sectors of emerging markets may be reduced as these relationships become more stable.","So last time we were focusing on repeated interaction and that’s what we’re going to continue with today. So specifically let’s just think of an example. Because in the last period, in the last period of the game we know that whatever we promise to do or whatever we threaten to do, in the last period, once we reached that last period, in that sub-game we’re going to play a Nash equilibrium. So if we look at the second to last period we might hope that we could promise to cooperate, if you cooperate today, tomorrow. So we got halfway through that calculation last time. So what we need to do is we need to make sure that the temptation of cheating today is less than the value of the promise minus the value of the threat tomorrow. By δ, I need to multiply all of these lines by δ and so on. The answer is we need 1, that’s our temptation, to be less than 2/, that’s the value of cooperating for ever starting from tomorrow, minus 0, that’s the value of defecting forever starting tomorrow, and this whole thing is multiplied by δ because tomorrow may not happen. So the particular defection we looked at just now was in Period 1, I’m going to defect, but thereafter, I’m actually going to do what the equilibrium strategy tells me to do. More generally, the reason this is even worse is because the punishment we looked at before, which was (D, D) for ever, the punishment (D,D) forever is itself an equilibrium. It’s credible because it’s itself an equilibrium. So what is the prediction–let’s be mean here. What does this model predict as a social science experiment. Consider the relationship that I have with my garage mechanic. Once I get a new car I’m not going to go to him anymore because I have to go to the dealer to keep the warranty intact. So once again the probability of the continuation of the relationship, as it changes, it leads to incentives to cheat. So we might be interested because mistakes happen, because misperceptions happen, we might be interested in using punishments that are less draconian than the grim trigger, less draconian than the death penalty. So this is nothing new, this is what we’ve always written down, this is what we have to check. So if, in fact, the difference between the reward and the punishment isn’t such a big deal, isn’t so big–the punishment is just, I’m going to give you one fewer cookies tomorrow–then you better be pretty patient not to go for the cookies today. In that case, it isn’t that the kids will worry about the relationship breaking down, you’re stuck with your kids, it’s just that they’re impatient. So what I want you to imagine is that you are running a business in the U.S. and you are considering making an investment in an emerging market, and again, so as not to offend anybody who watches this on the video, let’s just call that emerging market Freedonia, rather than give it a name like Kazakhstan, a name like something other than Freedonia. The plus is, from your point of view, the plus is wages are cheap where you’re going to get this production done. The bad news is that your agent in Freedonia can cheat on you. So your return will be 3 minus the wage you pay him. You’re only going to pay him once the job’s done, 3 - W, and he’s going to get W. He’s done his job–he hasn’t exercised his outside option, he hasn’t sold your materials–so he’ll just get W.Now, I’m slightly cheating here because this isn’t really the way the tree looks because I could choose different levels of W. So this upper branch where I invest and set W is actually a continuum of such branches, one for each possible W, I could set. So let’s imagine that this is a one shot investment. The starting position is it looks very attractive. So repeated interaction with probability of δ. So the punishment–it’s clear what the punishment’s going to be here–the punishment is, if he doesn’t do a good job, you fire him. We need this to be less than the value of continuing the relationship. What does he get if we end the relationship? If I know for sure we’re going to continue forever I can get away with paying the guy the going wage, at least in the limit."
251,economics,econ-159,lecture-23,"We look at two settings with asymmetric information; one side of a game knows something that the other side does not. We should always interpret attempts to communicate or signal such information taking into account the incentives of the person doing the signaling. In the first setting, information is verifiable. Here, the failure explicitly to reveal information can be informative, and hence verifiable information tends to come out even when you don’t want it to. We consider examples of such information unraveling. Then we move to unverifiable information. Here, it is hard to convey such information even if you want to. Nevertheless, differentially costly signals can sometimes provide incentives for agents with different information to distinguish themselves. In particular, we consider how the education system can allow future workers to signal their abilities. We discuss some implications of this rather pessimistic view of education.","So today we’re going to study asymmetric information. I’ll spell it with one “L” here as a concession to the Americans. It could be that Firm A also has medium costs. And it could be that Firm A has low costs, and the low costs are just the medium costs minus a little bit. So Firm A and Firm B know what Firm B’s costs are. Let’s just fill out that argument by putting in the Cournot diagram. But notice I’ve twisted the question a little bit. I’d like the other side not to know if I have high costs, but that’s not quite the question we asked. What should I do if I have middle level costs? And therefore, whether you choose to reveal or not, everyone knows that you’re high cost. The fact that the high cost firm doesn’t in fact go out and reveal information to you, reveals something about what it knows. If I was the high cost firm I’d like to remain hidden but I can’t remain hidden. You’ve all heard that expression, silence speaks volumes. So this is the idea that silence can speak volumes. Not if we take the model in Cournot literally because, suppose Firm B doesn’t know whether you’re high or middle, then he’s going to think your costs are somewhere in between and relative to your costs being middle he’s going to produce more, that’s the point here. So this example requires some explanation for the non-Americans. So basically you’re not going to lie on your resume. So it turns out that until the late nineties, the Los Angeles Municipality rules, local law, said that every restaurant in Los Angeles County, I think it was, had to get visited by the health inspector. Because for this story about information unraveling to work, the people who are the receivers of the information need to know that you got the certificates. So this idea that information unravels depended on certain key parts and the most important part was that the information was verifiable. But often, the information that you have–you have information, you want to reveal that information–but unfortunately it’s not so easily verifiable. There are good workers, we’ll call them G, and there are bad workers and we’ll call them B.We’ll assume that the productivity of a good worker, if you work for this firm, is going to be 50 and we can assume this is $50,000 or whatever but let’s just forget units for now and just call it 50. A bad worker, their productivity is only 30. All other things being equal is important because then we have to pay the good worker more. Everyone’s scratching their head down here. We’ll assume there are no opportunity costs. The new thing is I also need to check–actually I’ll give myself a bit more room here–I also need to check that the employer’s beliefs are consistent with the equilibrium behavior. And, in this equilibrium, one important party to the equilibrium, namely the guys who are going to employ you, that’s pretty important right? If in fact it’s the case, that it’s the good workers who are getting MBA’s and the bad workers who are not, then the only belief that the employers can have that’s consistent is the MBA’s are in fact the good workers and the non-MBA’s are the bad workers, is that right? So we’ll just assume that everybody lives for one year. Two years will be just enough to put off the bad workers. So what we need, we need enough difference in cost for good workers to get the degree and for bad workers not to want to do so. Raising tuition isn’t going to work because that’s the same for good and bad workers. So I want to start with some nerdy lessons about Game Theory if you like, and then I want to want to talk about some more specific lessons about the education system. That’s telling us that if you make it very, very easy to obtain qualifications in the U.S. society, for example, if you lower the standards that you need to get a high school degree and perhaps you lower the standards to get a college degree–I’m not saying that is happening, I don’t want to take a political position on this. Why is this a pessimistic model of education? Education, in this model increases inequality. The take away message is for education to work as a signaling device, for education to generate a separating equilibrium, some children have to be left behind."
252,economics,econ-159,lecture-24,"We discuss auctions. We first distinguish two extremes: common values and private values. We hold a common value auction in class and discover the winner’s curse, the winner tends to overpay. We discuss why this occurs and how to avoid it: you should bid as if you knew that your bid would win; that is, as if you knew your initial estimate of the common value was the highest. This leads you to bid much below your initial estimate. Then we discuss four forms of auction: first-price sealed-bid, second-price sealed-bid, open ascending, and open descending auctions. We discuss bidding strategies in each auction form for the case when values are private. Finally, we start to discuss which auction forms generate higher revenues for the seller, but a proper analysis of this will have to await the next course.","Well whiz them along this row as fast as you can. Each of them is going to make a little practice well and get some estimate of how much oil there is in the well, so they’re going to bid different amounts. But the idea is that the value of the good at hand, not only is it different for everybody, but my valuation of this good has no bearing whatsoever on your value for the good, and your value for the good has no bearing whatsoever on my value for the good. So if you happen to buy this good and you learn that in fact, I valued it a lot, that makes no difference to how happy you feel at having bought the good. Now, these are extremes and most of reality lies between. There is a certain amount of money in that jar. We’re playing this for real cash, so if you win you’re going to have to pay me. So now a round of applause for our winner. Let’s just get some idea of the distribution of those. How many people thought there was between $2.50 and $3.00? What we find, by a lot, is that the winning bid was much, much greater than the true value. So one way to think about this is to think about naïve bidding in this context. Most people shaded their estimate a little bit. And for some people ε is going to be a negative amount, which means they’re going to underestimate the number of coins in the jar. On average, the winning bid is going to be much, much bigger than the truth. There may be a little bit of initial enthusiasm, but then they fall back. So Ashley’s estimate was $5.00, but I’m now going to tell her that every single person in the room had a lower estimate than hers. If people are bidding their values–sorry not their values–if people are bidding their estimates, then as soon as Ashley discovers she’s won, she’s going to say: oh bother, I now know that my estimate was too high. She may say something more extravagant than bother, but at the very least, she is going to say: oh bother, I now know that everyone else had a lower estimate than me, and therefore my estimate of $5.00 is too high. So we need to think about how to correct for that. The relevant estimate of the number of coins in the jar for you when you’re bidding, the relevant estimate is not how many coins do I think is in this jar, that’s the naïve thing. So the lesson here is, bid as if you know you win. So how is that different from bidding as if you know you win versus if you won? So $1.60 is the winner and it turns out that the number of coins in this jar was $1.48. $1.25, okay, so how many of you–be honest now–how many of you bid significantly below your estimate? All right, now we’re not done here, let me move forward by moving away now just from common value auctions. So let’s talk about four different types of auctions. But now instead of paying the bid that they wrote down, they pay the second highest bid. It used to happen in a place called Filene’s Basement. So from a strategic point of view the descending open auction and the sealed first price auction are the same thing. So the fact that people’s hands are still up in the open auction, whereas you can’t see what people are doing in the sealed auction, makes these not identical, but there’s clearly a close similarity between them. So the first price auction you’re going to get your value minus your own bid if you win, and 0 otherwise. Who thinks you should bid more than your value?"
253,economics,econ-159,lecture-2,"At the start of the lecture, we introduce the “formal ingredients” of a game: the players, their strategies and their payoffs. Then we return to the main lessons from last time: not playing a dominated strategy; and putting ourselves into others’ shoes. We apply these first to defending the Roman Empire against Hannibal; and then to picking a number in the game from last time. We learn that, when you put yourself in someone else’s shoes, you should consider not only their goals, but also how sophisticated are they (are they rational?), and how much do they know about you (do they know that you are rational?). We introduce a new idea: the iterative deletion of dominated strategies. Finally, we discuss the difference between something being known and it being commonly known.","Okay, so last time we looked at and played this game. Then we looked at some possible payoffs, and now it is a game. Both of these lessons will reoccur today. In the second case, if both firms undercut each other, you end up with low prices, that’s actually good for consumers but bad for firms. Another example of this would be global warming and carbon emissions. Each of us individually has an incentive to emit carbons as usual. All of these things work by changing the payoffs. So the standard notation for players, I’m going to use things like little i and little j. So in that numbers game, the game when all of you wrote down a number and handed it in at the end of last time, the players were who? Second ingredient of the game are strategies. ( All of you, at the end last time, wrote down this number and handed them in so we had one number, one strategy choice for each person in the class. There’s actually no math going on here at all. I think an example might help those people who are disturbed by the notation. So here Player I’s strategy set, she has two choices top or bottom, represented by the rows, which are hopefully the top row and the bottom row. Well let’s ask somebody at random perhaps. I believe right is a dominated strategy because if Player I chooses top, then Player II will choose center, and if– I’m getting confused now, it looks better on my paper. But yeah, right is never the best choice. So what we know here, we know that Player II should not choose right. So this is the same definition we saw last time, just being a little bit more nerdy and putting in some notation. Okay, so the key here is going to be that there are two passes. Again, easy pass here just means no mountains, we’re not talking about something on the New Jersey Turnpike.)So the payoffs here are as follows, and I’ll explain them in a second. We should defend easy which is what most of you chose. That seems a pretty good way to predict how other people are going to play. So how many of you chose some number like 32, 33, 34? Actually I can tell you, nine of you did. That even if everyone else had the same reasoning as you, it’s still going to be way too high. Actually about twelve of you, raise your hands. Let me take this back to the board a second. No one is going to choose a number over 50. Did anyone choose – raise your hands, Be brave here. By the next slice down we’ll be able to eliminate – what is it – about 20 and above, so 30 down to above 20, and this will be an ‘in shoes, in shoes, in shoes’. How many of you chose a number between 30 and 45? So to get this slice, this next slice here, I need rationality; as some of you know that’s widely criticized in the social sciences these days. We’re never going to get the mike to this – try and get the mike in there. And Jeffrey Green: stand up if you’re here. Let’s have someone we haven’t had before. It’s asking a lot to get to 1 here, and in fact, we didn’t get to 1.In previous years we were even higher, so this was low this year. And in 2004, it was twenty-one and a half. And in 2005, we had a class that didn’t trust each other at all I guess, because the average was twenty-three. If you haven’t got a sheet in front of you, just write it on your notepad. And you need to think about how sophisticated do they think you are at playing games. Let’s move them this way so they’re in focus."
254,economics,econ-159,lecture-3,"We apply the main idea from last time, iterative deletion of dominated strategies, to analyze an election where candidates can choose their policy positions. We then consider how good is this classic model as a description of the real political process, and how we might build on it to improve it. Toward the end of the class, we introduce a new idea to get us beyond iterative deletion. We think about our beliefs about what the other player is going to do, and then ask what is the best strategy for us to choose given those beliefs?","Last time we talked a lot about the idea–I didn’t mention the name but here’s some jargon for you–we talked about the idea of deleting dominated strategies: looking at a game; figuring out which strategies are dominated; deleting them; looking at the game again; looking at which strategies are now dominated; deleting those; and so on and so forth. It’s probably just easier to have the idea there. So, in particular, let’s start working out what share of the votes you’d get if you chose position 1 or position 2, against different positions the other guy can choose. While we’re doing this we’ll figure out how these payoffs work as well. 2 is always better than 1, but we can see more than that in the pattern. We had 15, 20, then this one, up to 20, 25 and so on. But you’ll see that very clearly that Steven’s right: that choosing 2 will always get me 5% more of the votes than choosing 1 from here on down. I think you may have defined it already, but I couldn’t find a definition of strictly in the book we have. Sudiptha had suggested earlier on, you want to be close to 5. Whereas the payoff from choosing 3 against 5 is all the people at 1, all the people at 2, all the people at 3 and half the people at 4, 35%.And again, you can see exactly the same pattern is going to emerge here. The same pattern Steven pointed out before. Well there are examples in American History in which the Median Voter Theorem looks pretty good. Now, what I want to do now, what I want to is, periodically in the class and we have a model up there and we’ve got to analyze it. By the way, how many of you are Poly Sci majors who have seen this model before? Good we’ll talk about each of these in turn. So another issue here is, I just assumed that there were two candidates. That, I think, is the wrong conclusion here. But it turns out that if you make the voters distributed more realistically, let’s say like on a bell-curve shape, it makes actually no difference to the result at all. Imagine you’re Player I in this game, what do you think you’d do? Okay there’s a massive majority for Down. What would you choose if you just happened to know that Player II was going to choose Left? It seems like I’ve managed to rationalize choosing middle. All right, so in some sense it’s safer, it avoids the 0, although–I mean it’s true it avoids the 0–but it also doesn’t get the 5 and the 4. So what we’re going to look at is the expected payoff of Up versus, let me call it a (½, ½): a (½, ½) being equally likely that my opponent chooses Left and Right. And we know that Down does best if I think it was equally likely that the person was going to choose Left and Right. So this is my payoff from choosing Up against Left. So, you can confirm that for yourself at home, but in fact, if I draw a straight line, this will actually be correct. What about choosing Middle?Well once again, we can plot that point So if the other person’s choosing Right with probability 0, that’s the same as saying they’re going to choose Left, and if I chose Middle against Left, I get what? I think I might have missed slightly but it’s more or less right. So that third line, not to belabor the point, is going to go through here, through 4 and through 2, so this is the payoff from choosing Down against Left, and this is the payoff from choosing Down against Right, and I got those from looking at these payoffs here and here. It’s more likely than Y–the probability that they’re going to choose Right is more than Y, then the highest line of these three is this one, which corresponds to my choosing Middle. Set the intersection points equal, the equations equal to each other and solve. Take these two equations, put an equal sign between them, replace this PR throughout with X, I’m going to have one equation and one unknown and that even the math phobics in the audience did in high school. What is the most important game in the world? We’re going to use this idea of best response."
255,economics,econ-159,lecture-4,"We continue the idea (from last time) of playing a best response to what we believe others will do. More particularly, we develop the idea that you should not play a strategy that is not a best response for any belief about others’ choices. We use this idea to analyze taking a penalty kick in soccer. Then we use it to analyze a profit-sharing partnership. Toward the end, we introduce a new notion: Nash Equilibrium.","So last time we introduced a new idea and the new idea was that of best response. The idea was to think of a strategy that is the best you can do, given your belief about what the other people are doing: what your opponents are doing, what other players are doing. And more immediately, this weekend, as all of you are thinking the most event in the world was whatever was happening in Congress to do with Iraq, actually, the most important event in the world was taking place in England where my favorite team, Portsmouth, were playing Kaj, the head TA’s favorite team, Liverpool. So things you should do in life: read Shakespeare and see a soccer game. In principle the goalie could stay in the middle. We’ll come back and talk about that later. So the payoff here is something like u(left) if the goal keeper dives to the left is equal to 4, by which I mean there’s a 40% chance of scoring. So before we leave it, I’ve been making a point in this class of coming back to reality from time to time, so this is a very simple model of the soccer game in reality. Okay, good I was getting worried there for a second. You have to really shout because you’re miles from the mike there. Good, so one thing that’s clearly missing here is I’m ignoring that in fact right footed players find it easier to shoot to their left, which is actually the goalie’s right. We can think of this as the decision happening at the instant at which you kicked. Just in case I’ll move my mike a bit lower. And it turns out that ignoring middle for a second, ignoring middle ─ so these are real numbers, and these numbers come from a paper in the AER by Chiappori and some co-authors and for everyone at Yale, I’ll make that paper available to you through JSTORE or through the Yale Library, so you can go look at it if you’d like. And if those people, if you’re interested in that ─ and I realize at this point I probably lost the interest of most Americans in the room, but for the non-Americans in the room, the people who are interested in the real world ─ as I said before, I’ll put that article online and that goes through all the gory detail of this. So here we have an example but I want to go back to the generality and to a bit of formalism. So that could be a firm, it could be a law firm, for example, and they’re going to share equally in the profits . How do we think of that term B S S?When you’re working on your homework assignments, if your product, the thing you hand in was just S + S, then you might think what? Some of you are good at some parts of the homework, some of them are good at other parts of the homework. So S squared is her effort costs, it’s her input costs. So this is a relevant issue in a lot of businesses. We have Player I’s payoff as a function of the two efforts and now I want to find out what is Player I’s best efforts given a particular choice of S? What I’m going to do is I want to draw the two functions we just found and see what they look like. So the line I’ve just drawn is the best response for Player I as it depends on Player II’s choice. The way we read this graph, is you give me an S, I read across to the pink line and drop down, and that tells me the best response for Player I. Now we can do the same for Player II, we can draw Player II’s best response as it depends on the choices of Player I, but rather than go through any math, I already know what that line’s going to look like. It should be a reflection across the 45° line. But I can’t see that little box, so what I’m going to do is I’m going to redraw that little box. And when I threw those away, I was left once again with a little box, and I could do it again, and again, and again. So now I’ve got–actually, that looks like three equations, it’s really just two equations, because one of them implies the other. So let me rephrase, are these people, are these pair of partners in the firm, or two students working on their homework assignments, are they working more or less than an efficient level? I’m telling you they’re going to work too little. Let’s get this guy in the pink down here. So we get this scissors effect of looking at it this way. How many of you saw the movie about Nash?"
256,economics,econ-159,lecture-5,"We first define formally the new concept from last time: Nash equilibrium. Then we discuss why we might be interested in Nash equilibrium and how we might find Nash equilibrium in various games. As an example, we play a class investment game to illustrate that there can be many equilibria in social settings, and that societies can fail to coordinate at all or may coordinate on a bad equilibrium. We argue that coordination problems are common in the real world. Finally, we discuss why in such coordination problems–unlike in prisoners’ dilemmas–simply communicating may be a remedy.","Okay, so last time we came across a new idea, although it wasn’t very new for a lot of you, and that was the idea of Nash Equilibrium. What I want to do today is discuss Nash Equilibrium, see how we find that equilibrium into rather simple examples. And then in the second half of the day I want to look at an application where we actually have some fun and play a game. But let’s start by putting down a formal definition. Holding everyone else’s actions fixed, no individual has any incentive to move away. And this line was the best response of Player 2 as a function of Player 1’s choice. Somebody should feel free to cold call somebody here.) And you could see you could work around a little cycle there. It’s just we wouldn’t have a nice fixed point. In particular, Player 1 would have liked to get this 11 and this 8, but they don’t regret their action because, given that Player 2 played center, the best they could have got was 3, which they got by playing middle. So, this is the game we saw the first time. It should be the best response to find the Nash Equilibrium. So, let’s figure out what the Nash Equilibrium is in this game and I’m not going to bother cold calling because it’s too easy. So the best response for Player 1, if Player 2 plays left is clear to choose up. So, what are the Nash Equilibria in this game? Sometimes we’re getting–not only are we getting many Nash Equilibria, that’s something which–that shouldn’t worry us, it’s a fact of life. So, what I want to do is I want to convince you how to find–to discuss how to find Nash Equilibria in the game which, unlike these games, doesn’t just have two players–it has many players–but fortunately, not many strategies per player. I mean a key rule here; you’re not allowed to talk to each other: no communication in the class. So I don’t know what that is, maybe that’s about half. Then check; so a good method here in these games is to guess and check. There might be a Nash Equilibrium hidden under a stone somewhere. Can we raise the yeses again, the invest again. What I want to do is I want to play it again. Without cheating, without looking around you, if you invested–let Jude get a good view of you–if you invested raise your hand now. Everybody is strictly better off at the good equilibrium than the bad equilibrium. So it seemed like people didn’t have a lot of confidence that other people were going to invest. Suppose we had been close to the threshold but below, so I don’t know is the answer. Notice that what happened here, the way we spiraled down coincides with something we’ve talked about Nash Equilibrium already, it coincides with this idea of a self-fulfilling prediction. Here, in some sense the “good thing,” the “moral thing” in some sense, is to invest but it’s not the case that not investing dominates investing. So this is a social problem, but it’s not a social problem of the form of a Prisoner’s Dilemma. There are lots of coordination problems in society. And often, in coordination games bad outcomes result and I want to spend most of the rest of today talking about that, because I think it’s important, whether you’re an economist or whatever, so let’s talk about it a bit. So that’s another in which–there’s two ways in which a party can be a coordination problem. There’s this thing called The Wave that Americans insist on doing, and I guess they think that’s the good outcome. I didn’t say that, we’re going to cut that out of the film later. There are other technological network goods like this. Now, I used to say at this point in the class, none of you will have ever seen a bank run because they stopped happening in America more or less in the mid 30s. It really seems to be a shift in confidence. What is the famous bank run in the movies, in American movies? What makes them agree is Jimmy Stewart, right? And in particular, what we can persuade each other to do is to play the other Nash Equilibrium."
257,economics,econ-159,lecture-6,"We apply the notion of Nash Equilibrium, first, to some more coordination games; in particular, the Battle of the Sexes. Then we analyze the classic Cournot model of imperfect competition between firms. We consider the difficulties in colluding in such settings, and we discuss the welfare consequences of the Cournot equilibrium as compared to monopoly and perfect competition.","All right, so last time we were talking about The Investor Game and this was a coordination game, and we learned some things. And I don’t want to overplay the social importance of this, but go back a couple of years to what was happening in the aftermath of Katrina and realize how important–how bad things get when things fail to be coordinated. The more you thought other people were going to invest, the more likely that you were going to invest. By the way, for those of you–those of you who are, if you are doing that strategy, got me in trouble. So Nina’s preferences are Player 1’s preferences here. Games like it, they are coordination games but different people disagree about where you’d like to coordinate. How this relates to profits and consumer surplus. So as far as the consumers are concerned, these two products are perfect substitutes. So this equation I’ve just written, if you can imagine q + q, total quantity on the horizontal axis, and you could imagine price on the vertical axis, and basically what we’re saying is that prices depend on total quantities as follows: where the slope of this line is -b. Revenues minus costs makes profits, and again, for those of you who are less familiar with economics, I’m hoping this is not really too hard but you can read up on it. So here I have a new expression for Firm 1’s profit and I could do the same for Firm 2, but I’m not going too because it’s–I’m getting bored. Come this way, a little closer to the aisle, there you go. So what I need to do then is I need to figure out what is Player 1’s best response for each possible choice q of Player 2. Everyone just stare at that a second, make sure I got it right. For each q that you give me or that Player 2 chooses, I want to find out and draw what is Player 1’s best response. So the marginal revenue here, let’s put it in a different color, the marginal revenue looks something like this and as–I don’t know what your name is–as the guy said, the monopoly quantity is when marginal revenue equals marginal costs. Now, I’m going to claim that this monopoly quantity I claimed before is going to–our intuition says if the other firm isn’t producing, my best response must be to produce monopoly quantity which I can see on this picture, and I also claim that the math is telling me, just a kind of nerdy math is telling me, that that quantity is a - c over 2b and I claim that they’re the same thing. So this monopoly quantity is indeed a - c over 2b. So Firm 2 is already producing all of this quantity. So I’ll be losing money on any product that I produce. If you haven’t seen it before don’t panic. So if Firm 2 produces this amount then Firm 1’s best response is this amount. The way I’ve drawn it they’re not the same at all. The way we read this green graph is you give me a choice of Firm 1, q. I go up to the green line and go across and this tells me the best response for Firm 2. So this is the Nash Equilibrium in this Cournot game. So what we’re going to do is set these two things equal to each other, put in stars here. Now, this game, this game of imperfect competition between two firms competing in quantities, was thought up and studied by a French economist called Cournot almost a hundred years before Nash. It’s different from the partnership game, it’s different from the investment game. So clearly, if we produce the monopoly quantity, by definition, the monopoly quantity maximizes total industry profits. So this point maximized industry profits and this point maximizes industry profits. Here, Firm 1 produced nothing and Firm 2 produced a monopoly quantity; and here Firm 2 produced nothing and Firm 1 produced a monopoly quantity. So Steve and Patrick are respectively the managers of Coca-Cola and Poland Spring and Patrick believes that the Coca-Cola manager is going to–may be we should just make this Coke and Pepsi since two identical–they’re near enough and identical, right? So these are Coke and Pepsi, that will confuse me less. So Patrick’s response in Pepsi is to overproduce relative to the monopoly quantity, actually overproduce even relative to the Cournot quantity and produce all the way out here. So what quantity is Patrick going to produce? So you can imagine some firms trying to have an agreement. Well, one thing that goes wrong is that suppose Coke and Pepsi were able to–either to write a contract or whatever–to sustain joint monopoly output at this high price, this price which is actually–producing positive profits in the industry–it is going to turn out, therefore the price is going to be above costs. Each firm is going to produce a - c over 3b and there are two such firms."
258,economics,econ-159,lecture-7,"We first consider the alternative “Bertrand” model of imperfect competition between two firms in which the firms set prices rather than setting quantities. Then we consider a richer model in which firms still set prices but in which the goods they produce are not identical. We model the firms as stores that are on either end of a long road or line. Customers live along this line. Then we return to models of strategic politics in which it is voters that are spread along a line. This time, however, we do not allow candidates to choose positions: they can only choose whether or not to enter the election. We play this “candidate-voter game” in the class, and we start to analyze both as a lesson about the notion of equilibrium and a lesson about politics.","All right, so last time we started to study imperfect competition. We looked at two firms competing in quantities. Industry profits would be less than monopoly. We’ll do this relatively quickly but I hope I won’t rush it like I did last time. So this is a little bit more realistic perhaps. So if Pepsi is the low price drink in the market then no Coke is sold at all. We’re making a lot of very strong assumptions here, but nevertheless, it’s going to be instructive to look at this model. So I want to figure out the best response of Firm 1 as a function of the price chosen by Firm 2. The guy in there, do you want to shout out? So the other guy is pricing below costs, the way which I avoid making losses is to set my price above his price. I don’t want to make losses, so I just “get out of the market,” and the way I “get out of the market,” is by pricing above the other guy. Okay, so now more interestingly, we leave a little gap here, what if the other guy is pricing above costs? As small an amount below his price as I can. Suppose the other guy didn’t exist, suppose Pepsi didn’t exist, so Coke has the whole market, then we would solve out this problem. We would solve out what the monopoly price is. Now this is marginal cost or above so this is the best response. So it turns out it’s pretty to check that this is the only Nash Equilibrium in the game. It’s worrying because you can’t go away feeling comfortable about this. That’s good for my case, so a number of you think those are different products. How many would have a strict preference for Coke? The way we’re going to model differentiated products is to imagine, just to take a simple example, imagine a city and this city has one long straight road through it. So this object here we could think of as a transport cost. So I want to go back again, now we’re considering the line on the board as being flavor in beer, or location in a town, and I want to go back to politics now and go back to the interpretation we started with, so that left and right will end up being left-wing politics versus right-wing politics. So we’re going to be doing Political Science or Political Science as it meets Game Theory for the rest of the day. We’re also going to assume, just as we did last time, that voters are going to vote for the closest candidate. So, in particular, the new things here, two things, one the number of candidates is not fixed. So this is, I think, a nice idealized version of American politics. So if you win the election you get a prize equal to B. We’ll also assume that there’s a cost of running, so if you enter this election, win or not, you incur a cost of C, and we’ll assume that B is greater than or equal to 2C, and actually for today, let’s just keep things simple, and assume it’s actually equal to 2C. But that’s not the only part of the payoffs. People from behind that have the perspective. There’s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 people here. Okay, now we have 17 people it’s a bit easier. You guys have to decide whether you, okay. Claire Elise is going to get her own vote plus 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8 votes and Beatrice is getting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, how did I end up with eight, I thought I had an odd number. There’s another vote hidden behind there, I didn’t see you. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 he’s going to get 10 votes, including himself there are 10 votes here. Because then somebody’s definitely better off by standing up. So if anybody on either side of them runs, that person would simply lose. So the total sum of right wing votes is going to beat out half of the left wing votes. So Stacy’s going to pick up the right wing votes, she’s going to split. Is Claire Elise doing better in this election or out?"
259,economics,econ-159,lecture-8,"We first complete our discussion of the candidate-voter model showing, in particular, that, in equilibrium, two candidates cannot be too far apart. Then we play and analyze Schelling’s location game. We discuss how segregation can occur in society even if no one desires it. We also learn that seemingly irrelevant details of a model can matter. We consider randomizations first by a central authority (such as in a bussing policy), and then decentralized randomization by the individuals themselves, “mixed strategies.” Finally, we look at rock, paper, scissors to see an example of a mixed-strategy equilibrium to a game.","So last time we left things in the middle of a model, which was the candidate-voter model. If you like, every voter is a potential candidate but you know the positions of the voters. So let me choose this row, this row good okay. First, for this to be an equilibrium, it better be the case that they’re symmetric on left and right. So, we’ve already illustrated that they’re not particularly close to the center. If they run a right-wing third-party candidate–so that would be our guy over here, this might be–this might have payoff in terms of other things. This isn’t– I’m not making a left wing/right wing politics argument here–this is true for both wings symmetrically. Because the person in the center could stand up and win the majority. So all of these voters are going to vote for our left-wing candidate. But coming back to our lesson, which is what I guess we care about– coming back to our lessons, the third lesson here is if the candidates–if the two candidates are too extreme–where too extreme in this model meant beyond… meant less than 1/6 and more than 5/6–but are too extreme, someone in the center will enter. So actually, you’re going to be the players in this game. Each of you is going to choose do I want to live in the East Town or do I want to live in West Town?So, as usual, what’s missing is the payoffs. So, on the horizontal axis I’m going to put the number of people of your type in the town you end up in. Well, maybe this will work, so up to here this row and forwards you are short people. And in a minute I want all the people who are choosing East Town to raise their hands. I’m going to do it at a count of three and don’t cheat. Don’t look around you and see what’s going on. West Town: a little bit of spillage here but basically I’ve got West Town in the back. It wasn’t that people wanted to segregate. Yes, so Patrick shout out for the classroom. Exact; it really has to be exact for this to work. So at that mixed equilibrium–I don’t want to call it a mixed equilibrium–at that integrated equilibrium, I’m exactly indifferent about where I live, both towns look the same to me. So, we’ve got this several equilibria here; we’ve got at least three and we’ll come back and talk about whether there are others in a minute. So this is a game that was introduced by a guy called Schelling. That seems like a rather important idea in, for example, sociology. It was just to make it a game, sort of define things carefully. This seemingly innocent detail of my modeling technique threw up another equilibrium. So the other kind of strange thing here is by randomizing–wll, I don’t want to say randomizing, I want to say having society randomize for you–ended up being better than choosing–ended up better than, what you might want to call “active choice.” In this game, segregation is what resulted, at least in the stable equilibria, and you might be tempted if you’re an empirical sociologist, to go around the world and say, look I see segregation everywhere. So Jessica’s pointing out correctly that since the 1960s, this has been an incredibly hot issue in the U.S., and we’re talking about the bussing debate. I just want to point out that you could arrive at that policy by thinking about this kind of model. In fact, this is not just an issue of history. The central administration, this local government, the central government, can randomly assign people. So there’s another possibility here, which is individual randomization. I’m being a bit loose here but we’ll be much more precise in a moment. Or, in the numbers game we played, it was choose a number. It is a randomization over your pure strategies. So, the example I want to talk about is a game that I think is familiar to a number of you, but I’ll put up the payoffs and see. How many of you have not heard of rock, paper, scissors? I’m sure they all know it, so just cold call somebody. So I’m–people didn’t play this with their siblings? So it will net out at 0.So each of the pure strategies here rock, paper, or scissors–actually, I did rock, scissors, and paper, each of them when they play against 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 they yield an expected payoff of 0. Well, a 1/3 of the time I’m going to be playing rock, so a 1/3 of the time I’m going to be playing rock and then I’ll get the expected payoff from playing rock against 1/3, 1/3, 1/3."
260,economics,econ-159,lecture-9,"We continue our discussion of mixed strategies. First we discuss the payoff to a mixed strategy, pointing out that it must be a weighed average of the payoffs to the pure strategies used in the mix. We note a consequence of this: if a mixed strategy is a best response, then all the pure strategies in the mix must themselves be best responses and hence indifferent. We use this idea to find mixed-strategy Nash equilibria in a game within a game of tennis.","So last time we saw this, we saw an example of a mixed strategy which was to play 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in our rock, paper, scissors game. Let’s immediately refer that back to our example. So let’s talk about the payoffs from a mixed strategy. So let me try and push that simple idea a little harder. So stand up close together so I can at least see what’s going on here. Thanks guys I’ll come back to you in a second. We know that the team batting average, the average batting average of the Yankee’s–I don’t know what it is, I didn’t look it up this morning–but I know it lies somewhere between the player who has the highest batting average which I’m guessing is Jeter, I’m guessing, and the lowest, the person on the team who has the lowest batting average, who is probably one of the pitchers who played, who batted a few times in one of those inter-league games. ( So here’s a big conclusion that follows from that incredibly simple idea about averages lying between the highest one and the lowest one. In particular, each of them therefore must yield the same expected payoff. So if I pick more than one of them I’m going to get a weighted average, that’s a mixed strategy. So this definition of Nash Equilibrium, it’s exactly the same as the definition of Nash Equilibrium we’ve been using now for several weeks, except everywhere where before we saw a pure strategy, which was an S, I have replaced it with a P. So the same definition except I’m using mixed strategies instead of pure strategies. I want to make sure before I go on, are people looking very sort of deer in the headlamps? So just remember that the conclusion here comes from this very simple idea. Seems like we’re back to picking Venus and Serena. Look at the other two boxes, if Venus hits to Serena’s left and Serena guesses left, then we’re going to assume that Serena’s going to reach the ball and make a volley, but her volley only manages to go in–go over the net and go in–half the time, so the payoffs are (50, 50). So what we’re going to do is we’re going to exploit the trick that we have here, the lesson here. So I’m hoping that by doing this, I’m going to illustrate to you immediately, that this idea is actually useful, at least useful if you end up coaching the Williams sisters. So those last two steps were just algebra. So to find out how Venus is mixing what am I going to do? So if Venus is hitting it to Serena’s left more than .7 of the time, Serena should just always go to her left, and if Venus is hitting to the left less than .7 of the time, so to the right more than .3 of the time, then Serena should always go to the right. So that’s how this kind of comes back into the sort of the coaching manuals if you like. So this is a indirect or a strategic effect. How do I go about finding Serena’s equilibrium Q, what’s the trick here? So from Venus’ point of view, if she chooses left then her payoffs are now, and again I should use the pointer, 30 with probability Q, this is the new Q and 80 with probability 1-Q, 30 with probability Q plus 80 with probability 1-Q.Again, this is the new Q, I should really give it, put Q prime or something but I won’t. It’s going to be 90 with probability Q and 20 with probability 1-Q. What do we know about these two payoffs if Venus is mixing in equilibrium? Since she’s using both these strategies, these strategies must be equally good. If I did the algebra too quickly just trust me, I think I got it right. It must be the case that Venus is hitting the ball to the left less often. If Serena’s Q had not changed, remembering that Venus was indifferent before, how would Venus have changed her play?"
261,economics,econ-251,lecture-10,"In this lecture we move from present values to dynamic present values. If interest rates evolve along the forward curve, then the present value of the remaining cash flows of any instrument will evolve in a predictable trajectory. The fastest way to compute these is by backward induction. Dynamic present values help us understand the returns of various trading strategies, and how marking-to-market can prevent some subtle abuses of the system. They explain how mortgages work, why they’re called amortizing, and what is meant by the remaining balance. In the second half of the lecture we turn to an important application of present value thinking: an analysis of the troubles facing the Social Security system.","So this class and the next class and a half are going to be about Fisher’s theory of present value and the interest rate, and then we’re going to move to uncertainty. So your theory of asset pricing today, which was based on the assumption that you can forecast the future, necessarily implies the theory of asset pricing in the future. The simplest form is you get a yield curve in the newspapers. So the present value has this simple formula, but this is a formula that holds at every time t if you’re totally confident of your predictions of the Cs and of the future interest rates. So PV is going to be basically the same calculation. So the price at time 1 is just what’s left except you’ve chopped off the 1 + i everywhere. So this is a very famous and important formula which I want to pause a second and think about. Right, but you know that they’ve been relieved of this responsibility recently. If I had some room I’d put this somewhere. I’m going to repeat what he said, but I’m going to take longer to say it. We’re going to not hold you to writing PV anymore because we can’t count anybody figuring out what it is, and so you don’t have to tell us that. You’ve paid it out here instead of keeping it into the firm. So what’s going to be the price of the bond?Well, in the first period it looks like you get this incredible profit. You’ve paid some present value and you’ve made 20. That’s more than 7 percent, and look, everybody can see the interest rate is only 6 percent and we did better than 7 percent. So if you have a 1 year bond it’s going to pay–well, let’s say it’s 2 percent and this is equal to 1 +–can you see this or it’s disappearing. So that’s why these things are going to go down a lot more than you think. However, it’s perfectly possible for this whole bond at the beginning to be worth 100 the same as this bond at the beginning. Where was this formula that I wrote down? So it’s easy to lose track of the fact that this bond, because its coupon is higher than this bond, how could it possibly ever fall below this bond?Well, it falls below because it’s longer and the cash flows towards the end of it are being discounted by an interest rate–because everybody knows the interest rate’s going to go up. But if you don’t have to report mark to market, you don’t have to say the value of what’s left over, the public’s just going to see that you’re making money at the beginning. If I knew what the present value was at time 1 then I could get the present value at time 0 just by this formula. So in fact I don’t have to–now, I don’t know the present value at time 1, but if I go to the end, at the end of time, I know the present value of the bond is 0. So let’s just see how that works on an example that I hope I worked out properly before. I just said, take that payment on the right and discount it by 7 percent, so it’s 7.47.Now, what’s the present value here? So that’s how I can work backwards and figure out the present value today. B 29 is the first payment, so why didn’t this work? It’s because what’s left in the mortgage is getting smaller all the time. So a fixed rate mortgage pays the same coupon every year. And bankers wanted that to happen because that way their risk is going down every year. So the bankers are feeling more and more secure every year because the house is backing a smaller and smaller loan, or to put it another way, if you’re uncertain about what the price of the house will be in the future, you want to make sure that what is owed is going down in the future. Well, what happens if you want to move?If you want to move you’re going to sell the house. So were there any questions?Before I start this, were there any questions? Then the third mistake was Gore said, “Well, it’s impossible to privatize.” That was 2008.Recently, of course, the public has made another mistake. So that’s what Bush says and he’s said many times. For people who are old when the program began, they got sensational rates of returns, 40 percent, 30 percent, incredible rates of return. So where does the extra money go?It goes into the Social Security Trust Fund."
262,economics,econ-251,lecture-11,"This lecture continues the analysis of Social Security started at the end of the last class. We describe the creation of the system in 1938 by Franklin Roosevelt and Frances Perkins and its current financial troubles. For many Democrats, Social Security is the most successful government program ever devised and for many Republicans Social Security is a bankrupt program that needs to be privatized. Is there any way to reconcile the views of Democrats and Republicans? How did the system get into so much financial trouble? We will see that the mess becomes quite clear when examined with the proper present value approach. Present value analysis reveals the flaws in the three most popular analyses of Social Security, that the financial breakdown is the fault of the baby boomers, that privatization would bring young investors a better return than they anticipate getting from their social security contributions, and that privatization is impossible without compromising today’s retired workers.","Okay, today we’re going to talk a little bit more about Social Security. The man with a job has wondered how long the job would last. Now this you would get for your entire life, so when Roosevelt called it insurance, what was the main thing that you were insuring?Well, there’s a side part of the program which he mentioned, which is insuring people of disabilities, things like that. Okay, so it’s a combination of insurance, disability, but the main insurance is for living a long time. You’re going to be paid–the ratio of relative wage historically to what you get of the young people’s wage is going to be .9, then the slope drops to .32, then it drops to .15 and after you’re double–it’s actually, I think, 1.99–after you’re double the average–if your historical average wage was more than twice the average wage in the whole economy, it doesn’t do you any good. After the first year you retire, so when you’re 65, you’re getting 40 percent of the average wage, if you’re the average worker throughout your life. I might want to retire early and be a writer the rest of my life.” If you retire before 65 and you want to get your payments starting earlier, they say, “Okay, you can do that, but we’re going to cut the payments every year,” and they make some actuarial calculation so that it’s fair, based on how long the average person lives. They have to send the checks to everybody. Okay, this gives you an idea just of the size of it. So the benefits, the contributions, 593 billion. Then you have to pay out the benefits, which is some other rule, depending on what you earned in the past, so there’s no connection between the two. And in fact, the contributions are bigger than the benefits, so the trust fund is growing. It’s making more money than it’s paying out. What’s that got to do with the benefits you’re paying? So basically, somehow the system must have assumed that there would be three young people for every old person. So it’s not so surprising it’s gotten out of balance. But we’re going to see, there’s a much more fundamental reason why it’s out of balance. And so my solution is going to involve precisely a market like that. So you could say, suppose you owned 1 percent of all those payments, what would the value of that be?You could trade a security like that. Isn’t the interest you’re getting just taxes from another part of government? You can always look at how many tax–let’s take someone my father’s age. My father actually died, but a couple of years ago, my father, he could look back at his whole life, and he could look at how much money he paid in Social Security taxes when he was young. I could look at what he got every year until he died. Every birth cohort, the average person, what their return was, and you see, it was very high to begin with and it become pitiful. I regard those as less critical though, than the problem of the thing going broke, and these things which have split the country. How should we have expected it to go broke? Okay, so imagine that–and I’m saying it in terms of fathers and sons, but I could say mothers and daughters. Maybe I don’t need an operation, but I’m basically totally broke because I spent so much money rescuing my mother. Where did the million-dollar operation get financed? So for that whole time, she made a 0 percent interest. And that’s exactly what Bush and everybody else is predicting. Now the original start of Social Security was a little fuzzy. So from 40 to 80, it’s not until the ’80s that the people who are getting benefits were all people who fully contributed. For this generation, it’s still incredibly positive. And there were so many generations that got positive amounts of money. So you see that the loss in present value terms is going to be 11 dollars, 11 dollars out of 34, which is what your benefits were. The actual loss, which I computed for the real economy, is around 25 percent. So that’s how big each generation, 1 quarter of the typical–so here it’s 34 percent. Now if you want to look at the total present value loss, starting in the 1930s, for people born in the 1930s, you have to look at every generation’s losing the same 11.95 and so you take the infinite future of generations, and they’re losing 79.68, if you add up to infinity, and of course, that’s the gain that was given to the original generations. So then there was the baby boom generation. So I don’t know what Gore was thinking, especially since I was supposedly advising Gore about Social Security. You get the same Social Security benefits you would have had anyway. So in the problem set, I gave you three problems."
263,economics,econ-251,lecture-12,"In order for Social Security to work, people have to believe there’s some possibility that the world will last forever, so that each old generation will have a young generation to support it. The overlapping generations model, invented by Allais and Samuelson but here augmented with land, represents such a situation. Financial equilibrium can again be reduced to general equilibrium. At first glance it would seem that the model requires a solution of an infinite number of supply equals demand equations, one for each time period. But by assuming stationarity, the whole analysis can be reduced to one equation. In this mathematical framework we reach an even more precise and subtle understanding of Social Security and the real rate of interest. We find that Social Security likely increases the real rate of interest. The presence of land, an infinitely lived asset that pays a perpetual dividend, forces the real rate of interest to be positive, exposing the flaw in Samuelson’s contention that Social Security is a giant, yet beneficial, Ponzi scheme where each generation can win by perpetually deferring a growing cost.","All right, well, today I’m going to talk about Social Security again. So the young could constantly be making gifts to the old. They benefited from the Ponzi scheme, so the last generations suing Madoff are effectively suing the first people as well, and so we’ll see how the courts decide it. There’s no reason for the Ponzi scheme to end if you really think that the world’s going to go on forever, and therefore Social Security is a great Ponzi scheme which is actually beneficial. They begin with 3 apples when they’re young. So we have to figure out what equilibrium is and then we have to look at Social Security. It doesn’t matter if we call it log x or x is the same thing, but that’s a good question. Whatever they bought the first time they can now sell when they’re old. So the dividend we have to multiply by the price, which on one of the early classes I forgot. So the equilibrium is what are the prices every period of apples and land? So everybody has to think about the guy after him, and what the guy after him is thinking about what the guy after him is thinking, and it looks very complicated. So the physical asset isn’t quite changing hands. Of course, the length of time might be 3 days or it might be 1 month. Should we multiply the price of apples by q? He said turn it into general equilibrium. So now we’re just one step from solving this. 1 + r we’re going to guess it’s a constant and that’s just 1 over this p that I told you about before, the ratio p, the present value. So what is equilibrium going to be?So here’s equilibrium. That’s given by the price p. We’ve assumed there’s a price p.So they’re going to say to themselves, “Okay, I’ve got 3 apples when I’m young, 1 apple when I’m old is not worth the same in present value terms–it’s just 3 + 1 P because the old apple’s not worth as much at time t as it as time t + 1, it’s 3 + 1p. So they’re going to spend 1 half times the present value of their income, divided by the present value of the price of the old apple which is the apple we’re talking about because they’re consuming when they’re old now. So it’s correct what I wrote, but it doesn’t sound correct. The old generation, when they were young at time 1 they bought land looking forward to their old age. Now, after we get the ps we’ll go back and figure out what the price of land is. If the ratio of two prices is p it doesn’t matter what their levels are–so I might as well as think of one of them as 1 and the other one as p. I could think of the first one as 2 and the second one as 2 p. That would be the same thing, right?So if I thought of the first price as 2 and this price as 2 p I’d put a 2 here, a 2 here, and a 2 here and it wouldn’t change anything. So if this is the p then what are the prices? What’s the price of land which is going to be a constant? So this ratio up here, this is another thing, this also this number is equal to 1.225 + 1 divided by 1.225. That was it as far as Fisher’s concerned, but then Fisher says once we’ve found general equilibrium we can go back to financial equilibrium and figure out what the price of land is, which is the present value of the dividend, so it’s price is 1.225, and the step I left out, which you’re asking about, you can also figure out what assets everybody’s holding. What I should have done is done Fisher’s trick of figuring out the price of the asset, which is 1.225 and then, of course, we know the guy must have bought 1 asset in order to use up his budget set, but that clears the market for assets. What would I change and solve differently?Well, all I would do is I would change this to a 2. And so p = 6 + or - 36 - 8 over 4.And so that, I hope I did that right, I hope you’re checking it. So r now equals–before I write it you can figure out what it is yourself in a second. Do you think the interest rate went up or down in the new economy? So if we had more and more children in every generation, so every 30 years let’s say the population doubled, that’s not such a high growth rate per year, you’d have 6 and 2 here and then it’d go up to 12 and 4. And what happens is Social Security isn’t solved."
264,economics,econ-251,lecture-13,"In this lecture, we use the overlapping generations model from the previous class to see, mathematically, how demographic changes can influence interest rates and asset prices. We evaluate Tobin’s statement that a perpetually growing population could solve the Social Security problem, and resolve, in a surprising way, a classical argument about the link between birth rates and the level of the stock market. Lastly, we finish by laying some of the philosophical and statistical groundwork for dealing with uncertainty.","All right, so I’m going to finish talking about overlapping generations today. People’s lives were shorter than the lifetime of the economy, and to go to the extreme, the economy goes on forever, even though people only live two periods. Now this model, I’ve been told, is the hardest thing you do the entire class. So the land is constantly changing hands. And so now we have a case, an extreme case, where people only hold the asset for one period. The reason I can make this simplification is by symmetry. Even though this generation is buying the land and selling the land, in Fisher’s story, you don’t have to pay attention to that. So he started without it and ended without it. We just, in every generation, we look at–remember, I forgot to write the utility functions, so we have U of consumption when young and old is 1 half log young . And then this good here is only worth 55 percent of that good. He wants to do all his consuming in period 1, but he hasn’t–that’s another subtle thing about this. From the price of the asset, this discounted dividends, that’s going to be 1 over (1 + r), + 1 over (1 + r) squared, + 1 over (1 + r) cubed, + …, by the way, that’s = to p + p squared + p cubed, you notice, okay?So the discounted value of the dividends is the price of land. 2 guys at 3 and 1, which means 6 and 2.Then you’re going to have 12 and 4. It’s going to be a gigantic growth, and so each generation, when it’s old, the young guys, if there’s 6 and 2 here now–I should use a different color. And each one, when he gets old, getting a full unit. So it would seem that if you had a faster growing population, then Social Security would be a much better deal, because the young would have to give up less to the old and still get fully paid back when they were old, and so Social Security wouldn’t have been a problem. And so I even calculated the utility of each of the people. When you do logs of small numbers, you get negatives, so that’s easier to look at. So I did the interest rate, 1 over 1 + r = p, so the inverse of p is this thing. So the forward rate is 161 percent, and if you think of that as 30 years, that’s an annualized 3.2 percent interest rate. So this Social Security doubled the interest rate from 81 percent to 161 percent. I could just solve that equation on the left, and so I plug in now the growth rate from generation to generation, 1 + growth, and here I’ve got 2.So it doubles every period, just the example I did, and so I solve it and you see that of course from the generations growing and land is being more productive and there are more apples and stuff like that, there’s just more for everybody to consume. So I’m going to now talk about market clearing at any time, except the first one, which is more complicated. So somebody ask me a question if they don’t know why this is right. Whoever just asked it, maybe you still don’t know why it’s right. How much is the endowment when the big generation is young? So if this is the 1 old guy’s endowment, 2 young guys who have 3 each, that’s endowment of 6, + the land is 1, so you get 8. So this dividend, you have to discount it by 1 + r. This one, you have to discount it twice. First to bring it back here, that’s 1 + r, then to bring it back here, that’s another 1 + r. So 1 + r, 1 + r. The third dividend, you discount first at the small discount, then at the big discount, then at the small discount, just like that. What are we going to do with it except put it into stocks. So that would tell you that the interest rate was going to be bigger or smaller. Okay, are there any questions about this? Land is always producing 1 every period and we get 2 different prices. So a high interest rate when the generation is small, and a low interest rate when the generations are big. I’m calling young your peak earning years and old I’m calling the stuff when you’re retired, I’m not earning very much. It says, in every state of the world, what is the random variable’s value?So our state of the world, by that I mean something that’s so detailed that it tells you the value of every random variable. Okay, so now two incredibly important concepts, which I’m sure you know–or at least the mean you know–just the average, what’s the expected payoff? So the expectation of 1 dice is 3 and 1 half. So if you got a 4 you could say you were off by 1 half."
265,economics,econ-251,lecture-14,"Until now, the models we’ve used in this course have focused on the case where everyone can perfectly forecast future economic conditions. Clearly, to understand financial markets, we have to incorporate uncertainty into these models. The first half of this lecture continues reviewing the key statistical concepts that we’ll need to be able to think seriously about uncertainty, including expectation, variance, and covariance. We apply these concepts to show how diversification can reduce risk exposure. Next we show how expectations can be iterated through time to rapidly compute conditional expectations: if you think the Yankees have a 60% chance of winning any game against the Dodgers, what are the odds the Yankees will win a seven game series once they are up 2 games to 1? Finally we allow the interest rate, the most important variable in the economy according to Irving Fisher, to be uncertain. We ask whether interest rate uncertainty tends to make a dollar in the distant future more valuable or less valuable.","We’ve dealt so far with the case of certainty, and we’ve done almost as much as we could in certainty, and I now want to move to the case of uncertainty, which is really where things get much more interesting and things can go wrong. To the extent that the probability is on the off diagonal they’re negatively correlated. So those are basically the key formulas to know. That is, knowing the outcome of X in this way of doing it, if I know that X turned out to be 1, Y has to turn out to be a third. And similarly knowing the outcome of X tells you nothing about the outcome of Y. This is 9 times this and this is 9 times that. So since it’s linear in X you can hold Y fixed, and the X is just the same and you’re going to get something that adds up to 0. You reduced your standard deviation without affecting your expectation. And because there were a lot of oceans and a lot of ships this number went down further and further. <> The variance is going to equal 1 over N times sigma squared. And let’s just say it again so you get this straight. So these are the outcomes X and this is the probability, probability of outcome, or frequency of outcome. And the third thing that we’re going to use is that the normal distribution is characterized by the mean and standard deviation, that’s all it takes to write the formula of this down, and these numbers, these are called thin tailed. If I tell you that X has turned out to be 1, that tells you that Y has to be a good outcome of 1 third, because if X is one this never happens. So you know that Y had to have been the good outcome up here. Suppose I tell you the good outcome of Y has happened. 5 ninths, so that’s it, because the probabilities are now–you’re reduced with .4 and .5 so 5 ninths of the time. How do you figure that out?Well, a naïve way, a simple way of figuring that out is to say, well, what could happen? Here they’ve got one win, two wins and one loss. Oh, so if I ask, by the way, in this tree whatever the opinion is here, which turns out to be .68 something, yeah, I should have asked you to guess, .68 something. So if I take the opinion here times .6 plus the opinion here times .4 that’s also going to equal .68. And that’s what’s going to be the key to computing the thing much faster rather than going through every branch which is such a pain because there are an exponentially growing number of paths, very bad to have to compute by hand. So instead of trying to figure out path by path, through these exponential number of paths what the chances of each path are, why it’s hard to compute here, it’s .6 times .6 times .4, a complicated calculation, I’m now going to do something simple. What would I think after the Dodgers won the first game? So that’s the method of iterated expectation and we’re going to turn this into quite an interesting theory in a second, but I want to now put that on a computer to show you just how completely obvious this is, I mean, not obvious, fast this is. I simply had the probabilities of the Yankees winning which was .6, which I could change. Now, how do I take a 3 game World Series? So now what’s your opinion going to be?If you’ve won 2 games then the Yankees have to have won. This is the first game, second game, third game, fourth game, fifth game, sixth game, seventh game. So we want to talk a little bit more about impatience. If you thought that people exponentially discounted like they thought each year was only 95 percent–if the interest rate’s 5 percent it sounds like the discounting is .95, so if next year’s only 95 percent as important as this year, and the year after that is only 95 percent as important as the first year, and the third year is only 95 percent as important as the second year, .95 in 100 years to the hundredth is an incredibly small number. That seems to make for a lot of discounting. So for any time I could figure out D(t) = amount I would pay, I’m going to be done in one minute, amount I would pay today for 1 dollar for sure at time t. And that number, obviously, is going to go down as t goes up, and we know how to compute it by backward induction."
266,economics,econ-251,lecture-15,"According to the rational expectations hypothesis, traders know the probabilities of future events, and value uncertain future payoffs by discounting their expected value at the riskless rate of interest. Under this hypothesis the best predictor of a firm’s valuation in the future is its stock price today. In one famous test of this hypothesis, it was found that detailed weather forecasts could not be used to improve on contemporaneous orange prices as a predictor of future orange prices, but that orange prices could improve contemporaneous weather forecasts. Under the rational expectations hypothesis you can infer more about the odds of corporate or sovereign bonds defaulting by looking at their prices than by reading about the financial condition of their issuers.On the other hand, when discount rates rather than payoffs are uncertain, today’s one year rate grossly overestimates the long run annualized rate. If today’s one year interest rate is 4%, and if the one year interest rate follows a geometric random walk, then the value today of one dollar in T years is described in the long run by the hyperbolic function 1/ √T, which is much larger than the exponential function 1/(1.04), no matter what the constant K. Hyperbolic discounting is the term used to describe the tendency of animals and humans to value the distant future much more than would be implied by (exponentially) discounting at a constant rate such as 4%. Hyperbolic discounting can justify expenses taken today to improve the environment in 500 years that could not be justified under exponential discounting.","So we considered for a long time a world of certainty. But if you did this the next day, and things were independent, on the second day, of the first day, you’d have a new price, 104 the next day, and you could see whether the price went up or down or not. So your total after 2 days would be 4 dollars. 30 times 250 is 7,500 times, you would have ended up with 350 or 400 dollars by the end. So there are two things that I expected you to say, that one being the second and a very important one. Maybe I’ve got one decimal too many there. It could be 500, it could be 23, it could be 75. Already by looking at the prices today, you have a tremendous idea of what the prices are tomorrow. So I should have discounted each day by whatever the interest rate is. Suppose that you thought, well, maybe people–maybe I want to ask a more complicated question. I want to say, suppose I only look at stocks that went up yesterday. Well, the market is pretty good on those too. Then you have to see whether it’s significant. He said, “Let’s use the price to predict the weather.” The government spent 250 million dollars in this area forecasting the weather. Okay, so that’s the efficient markets hypothesis, which seduced many in the economics profession, and there’s still a tremendous amount of truth to it, at least at the level–if you don’t know anything and you want to know something about the future, look at the prices today. If I change this to 106, and I change this to 96, I haven’t changed the expectation, so the price is going to stay the same. So now you did a problem set where you had to do a bunch of these things. You do experiments with animals, you get the same conclusion. If I don’t get the stuff now, who knows when I’ll ever get it? But if you do this random thing, you get the thing that goes much slower, and it goes with a slope of -1 half. This is 100 percent and this is 50 percent as the interest rate. Because every time, you’re multiplying by such a small number up here compared to this, this thing is just negligible compared to this. So you’re going to have half of this value is going to be the value here. It’s only the low interest rates that matter. The question is, what’s the number that they put here?So there’s uncertainty about defaulting, and if defaulting means paying 0–we’re going to think a second about what it really means–if it means paying 0, that’s no big deal. After 10 years, they think that JP Morgan, the leader, the great investment bank which is now a regular bank and the most successful thing, they think 10 percent, the market thinks it will be out of business within 10 years. But then, you know, eventually maybe the government’s going to stop worrying about Citibank and so after 10 years, Citibank, what used to be the biggest bank in the world, has got a 25 percent chance of going out of business, 25 percent it won’t even be here. So that’s how they figured out what all these default probabilities are. But we still are trading all these potential corporate bonds. Now let’s say that the American–so here we’ve got the 1 year bond, pays off in yellow. And let’s assume–it doesn’t really matter, but let’s assume that that price is .9 and then the 0, the 2 year 0 in America, which pays off 1, 1, 1 here. What is the 2-year Argentine bond going to be worth? I’m not saying in real life, but in this example. But in 10 years, you know, it could be very different. And so that’s shocking to most people, I think, a shockingly high probability of those things going out of business. Knowing the price of the credit default swap, you could get d. So you could deduce d in two different ways, either from the American bond price or from the credit default swap. Now what would the credit default swap be worth over here? We had the price of the Argentine bond is 80, compared to the–okay, so the American bond price is 95, so we just took 80 over 95."
267,economics,econ-251,lecture-16,"In the first part of the lecture we wrap up the previous discussion of implied default probabilities, showing how to calculate them quickly by using the same duality trick we used to compute forward interest rates, and showing how to interpret them as spreads in the forward rates. The main part of the lecture focuses on the powerful tool of backward induction, once used in the early 1900s by the mathematician Zermelo to prove the existence of an optimal strategy in chess. We explore its application in a series of optimal stopping problems, starting with examples quite distant from economics such as how to decide when it is time to stop dating and get married. In each case we find that the option to continue is surprisingly valuable.","We’re now at the stage where we’re considering the implications of uncertainty, so I hope that the subtlety, and surprise element of the class, will gradually pick up without increasing the difficulty. So that gives you the price with default. So all right, if you go from here to here the value here’s 100 + C, so if P is just 100 + C let’s leave it as 100 + C.That’s if the guy actually pays. Then when you go back one step further you have to do the whole thing again divided by 1 + i. You shouldn’t have a 1 - d in there as well, shouldn’t you just be discounting by 1 - d and 0? So, sorry about that, so you were right, I said it wrong. Now from that we know that we can deduce what all the forwards are. This is going to be a bigger number than that, and in fact that ratio is the default probability. So this is assuming, remember, that if the Argentine bond defaults at this period, say, it’s never going to pay anything after that. So I should probably have a hat because I’m referring to Argentina with the hat. So the Argentinian discount is like taking the–I hope I haven’t got the thing–so the American forwards are going to be less than the Argentine forwards. So it’s extremely simple to deduce what the market thinks Argentinian default probabilities are year by year if you make the added assumption that once they default they default completely. You just add some spread to the interest rate. You can guess by the spread what the probability of default is. If it’s 8 percent interest there and 3 percent interest here somebody must think the probability of default is 5 percent there. We always are on a tree, but now we’re going to use a slightly extended definition of a tree. But if the tree ends you can always go backward from the end to the beginning and figure out what to do at the very beginning. It’s all just backward induction, which is what I’m teaching you. I don’t think I’ll talk more about it unless anyone wants to ask me something. I thought they were when I invented them. But anyway, so the red and the black works like this. But now, is it really barely even, this game? So he’s saying this isn’t ambitious enough. And, by the way, playing to the end of the deck is going to lose you 1 dollar because there are 25 black and 26 red, so this argument that if you just play to the end of the deck you’ll break even it’s not true after you’ve already taken a black one out, so you could lose it. But you see, that strategy would get you to quit after the first one. You’ve got your dollar, be satisfied and quit. So anyway, it’s really shocking, I think. Are there any questions?This is a critical formula, a critical spot. Once you know what the values are down here you can always go backwards and figure out the value here. Well, if you look at the formula up there it’s just the formula you wrote, we wrote, which is you could quit if you wanted to. So sorry, I was getting confused with the cards. So he wanted to quit after the first draw, but it’s much better than that. If you get a black card you’re going to go here. If you were supposed to stop at that point you would have had value 0. And if you work, you’re going to work out low numbers 2 and 3 in the homework, and then you’ll see very clearly why it is that this option is just so powerful. So it says the option value is more important than the fact that the cards are against you. Of course we’re going to do it by backward induction, but what do you think it’s going to look like, the optimal strategy? You see the second to last woman, you talk to her, you find out how good the match is. You should take her if the match is above what? With 1 woman the value is a half, 1 match to go. So you can tell for however many women you want."
268,economics,econ-251,lecture-17,"This lecture is about optimal exercise strategies for callable bonds, which are bonds bundled with an option that allows the borrower to pay back the loan early, if she chooses. Using backward induction, we calculate the borrower’s optimal strategy and the value of the option. As with the simple examples in the previous lecture, the option value turns out to be very large. The most important callable bond is the fixed rate amortizing mortgage; calling a mortgage means prepaying your remaining balance. We examine how high bankers must set the mortgage rate in order to compensate for the prepayment option they give homeowners. Looking at data on mortgage rates we see that mortgage borrowers often fail to prepay optimally.","So last time we found out how to evaluate options, especially stopping options where you don’t have so many options. And we discovered through two examples, at least, that the option is worth more than people realize. So I want to teach you how to think about that problem. So let’s start with the callable bond problem. So callable bonds are issued by corporations and they pay, usually, an interest rate, say 9 percent. So this is the payment and this is the remaining balance. So for now that’s going to be our model of uncertainty and in a few minutes I’m going to try and indicate why complicating it won’t have much effect. Make sure you understand it before I move on because it’s really nothing but notation. You take 8, 16 percent up is about 9.3 percent interest and 16 percent down you go from 8 percent to 6.8 percent. If you couldn’t call it, non-callable bond, why would you expect it to have such a high price? So the question is if you figured out the value at the end of the tree, which is trivial because at the very end you’re just going to get 109 for sure, can you figure out what the value is at the beginning of the tree. Every period the company’s promising to pay 9 dollars. So it’s losing money right from the start. Someone else, why wouldn’t they do that?You see, the puzzle is, the company has promised to pay 9 dollars forever. It could have borrowed and only had to pay 8 dollars. So I hope you’re following because this is going to get a lot more surprising when we do mortgages, but it’s the same logic, 113.236. You can tell when they should call it because–you’ll know when they call it because if they do call it what’s the value? So if you keep going it’s going to be 1 + r times the same thing, 1 half, and then you’re going to have to make the coupon payment the next up–so just a second, where should we go?So here this is the interest rate, so at any node, you can pick any one like here in the tree, this one. Maybe it’s not paying the hundred whatever that is, plus 1 half times 9 + V. So the only difference between this callable–non-call case and the call case is you notice that the second term is exactly the same in the two cases, but here we’ve added the minimum of 100 in that because you either could continue or you could pay 100.Of course the values, V up here and V, are not the same as the V’s here because they’ve all been concatenated by taking the minimum with 100. And then, of course, it gets more complicated and I’m not going to be able to draw it because now this thing, three things could happen from here, and from here three things could happen. So from here I could go here, stay the same or go up. Well, I can’t keep the same numbers because if I have 1 half and 1 half that doesn’t allow any probability for going in the middle. So I should put the square root of 2 here and the square root of 2 here. So just because I’ve got three nodes or five nodes on average they can turn out to be the same, and the average spread, the average spread squared can also be the same as the binomial. You also have to say what do you get by dissolving the mortgage, how much do you have to pay? So that’s the 7 percent coupon of the mortgage, coupon of mortgage. Then what should the guy pay to get out of the mortgage? So it’s B squared and B to the 29th because you’ve made the first coupon payment. B is X 1.07 blah, blah, blah, X times 1.07 to the 28th. The difference between this and this is the last payment which is 1 over 1.07 to the 30th. You were paid 8.05, so obviously what’s left that you’re owed is the difference, 98.95 and that’s exactly what the equation was that I wrote before. I can pay the remaining balance and get out of it. So the non-callable mortgage, if the homeowner was so stupid that he never prepaid and the mortgage interest rate is 7 percent and the interest rate starts at 6 percent that’s obviously great for the bank. And so the interest rate process is the same. You not only have to count on them, you have to count them."
269,economics,econ-251,lecture-18,"A mortgage involves making a promise, backing it with collateral, and defining a way to dissolve the promise at prearranged terms in case you want to end it by prepaying. The option to prepay, the refinancing option, makes the mortgage much more complicated than a coupon bond, and therefore something that a hedge fund could make money trading. In this lecture we discuss how to build and calibrate a model to forecast prepayments in order to value mortgages. Old fashioned economists still make non-contingent forecasts, like the recent predictions that unemployment would peak at 8%. A model makes contingent forecasts. The old prepayment models fit a curve to historical data estimating how sensitive aggregate prepayments have been to changes in the interest rate. The modern agent based approach to modeling rationalizes behavior at the individual level and allows heterogeneity among individual types. From either kind of model we see that mortgages are very risky securities, even in the absence of default. This raises the question of how investors and banks should hedge them.","So we’re talking now about mortgages and how to value them, and if you remember now a mortgage–so the first mortgages, by the way, that we know of, come from Babylonian times. On the other hand if the interest rates go way down here, so the present value of what you owe if you kept paying it becomes huge, you don’t have to face that big loss because you just prepay at whatever the remaining balance is there and then you’ve protected your downside. So when exactly should you be exercising your option?Well, we went over this last time. So I’m just going to figure out the value of 1 dollar of remaining balance and I’m going to call that W, let’s say. And then with the other probability 1 half, plus I make the payment, but I go down instead of up and so I have B over Bbut I have W, and that’s also times 1 half. Here the present value of 1 dollar, figuring it out that way, is .98, obviously it’s divided by 100, but the key is that now you can see just by looking at it where the 1s are is where the guy decided to prepay. It’s hard to tell where the prepayment is. It looks like the stock market, but I assure you the stock market had almost nothing to do with it. It’s going to cheat the bank if the homeowners are acting rationally. Furthermore you have evidence that the banks don’t expect them to be acting optimally because the banks aren’t charging them 8 or 9 percent interest, which is what they would need to pay to get the thing worth 100, they’re charging them 7 and 1 half percent interest which for the optimal pre-payer is worth much less than 100 to the bank. You have to have a number of scenarios and <> to each one. No one in their right mind would make such a prediction. You’re normally going to pay–so this is this whole function here, so I should write this as .1 plus, can you see that over there, maybe not, so this plus .1.So there’s a baseline of 10 percent and if the interest rate is high, so the interest rate is above the mortgage rate no one else is going to prepay because this is going to be a negative number and this will be 0. So you’re just going to do .1,10 percent. So this is like 60 percent and most of the time you’re around 10 percent, and you try and fit this curve. It’s because some people are moving or they’re getting divorced and they have to sell their house. They’re just not paying attention and so they don’t realize. As interest rates go up less people prepay. So this is the value of 1 dollars left of principal. Now, before I do that I want to say that there’s a better way to do this. You’re valuing the mortgage payments they’re going to make to you, you’re getting a certain amount of money from them, 60 percent of them suddenly disappeared in 1 month leaving 40 left, but now interest rates are back exactly where they were before. Right after… Right here you’d buy it up, right there, but what model would you use to predict prepayments? Would you split it into two groups and then model it separately? So you describe a person by what his cost of prepaying is and how alert he is. The more alert he is and the lower the cost of prepaying the closer to rational he is. So who are the hyper rational guys?They are the people with the really high alertness up there and the really low cost, so they’re the guys back there. At the other corner you’ve got the guys who have very low alertness and very high costs. So I pick the four parameters to fit the data as much as possible. Yes, well there probably are other factors. So what would you commonsensically think are the factors? So I’m not telling you all the factors, but these were the two main factors. So the first thing to notice is–so I’ll just ask you two questions. So in this tree that we’ve built, here’s the tree, it’s going like that, and at every node we’re predicting–for each class of people we’re predicting where his 1s are. But will it keep going up like this and this? So this idea that the mortgage curve, instead of being like this goes like that, this is what was called negative convexity. So this is the mortgage value as a function of interest rates. So how do you go about doing it?What does hedging mean? Yes you should take the bet because 60 percent of the time you’re going to win 100 dollars–no. This is the World Series spreadsheet you had before. So 60 percent is the probability of the Yankees winning a game. So you take any node like this one you’re always taking 60 percent of the value up here plus 40 percent of the value here. I’ll give you one second to try and think it through. So you’re making a bet on whether you’re right or wrong."
270,economics,econ-251,lecture-19,"Professor Geanakoplos explains how, as a mathematical economist, he became interested in the practical world of mortgage securities, and how he became the Head of Fixed Income Securities at Kidder Peabody, and then one of six founding partners of Ellington Capital Management. During that time Kidder Peabody became the biggest issuer of collateralized mortgage obligations, and Ellington became the biggest mortgage hedge fund. He describes securitization and tranching of mortgage pools, the role of investment banks and hedge funds, and the evolution of the prime and subprime mortgage markets. He also discusses agent based models of prepayments in the mortgage market.","Here to give a lecture, that I gave one evening, that we couldn’t record. And I call it a personal history because by some accident, I participated at many of the key points in the recent history of the mortgage market. And in some ways, more interesting than the stock market. Before they can live in the house they have to get the money to buy the house. It wasn’t invented after the industrial revolution. It was invented more than 3,000 years ago near the Middle East. So mortgage pass-throughs are the second tier of this hierarchy. So this was very standardized and very high performing loans. And you know one guy comes and says he wants a loan. So, I’ve estimated that this operation together with the next one I’m going to talk about, has reduced mortgage rates by at least a percent. Now in 2002, when I made these slides, I’ll just give you an idea of the size of the mortgage market. So actually that may be a little bit big. So the next innovation after the 1970s, came in the 80s and that’s the collateralized mortgage obligation market. And then cut the promise into two pieces. So as the interest rate went up, the payments would get smaller. And that way, of course competition in the CMO market raises the amount people are willing to pay for the pass-throughs. So for me, it crystalized what the essence of finance is. But of course, you have to guarantee that the money is going to be paid to them. The houses backed the promises of the homeowner like in Babylonian times. It’s very important to running a financial system. So this, as I said, was a multi trillion-dollar market. So it’s much easier for a sales force to sell with that situation than it was for the other investment banks to sell. We should always be making conditional predictions. So clearly, there’s a connection between the mortgage rate you got and your original mortgage and the new rate that you can refinance into. But another thing that’s interesting is burn out. So that’s another thing people had observed. So that would be an old fashioned way of measuring things. Even though they’re in exactly the same circumstance in terms of refinancing. And of course, people hear from their friends. So I built a model, together with the researchers at Kidder Peabody. If you have a pool of people, you can see the vertical is how many people of each types. And I thought, my gosh this is an untold story that needs telling. Just like I explained, we were doing at Kidder when we tried to get the same cash flows in every scenario. But once they understand our strategy, we don’t have to meet the same test that a simple broker meets on behalf of, let’s say a poor retired individual. Is there going to change in government regulation? Is the price of oil suddenly going to change?There’s so many things they can go wrong in a company, it really is very hard to hedge. And we grew into the biggest mortgage hedge fund in the country. So this was the second crash that I was exposed to. And in 1998, it suddenly went out of business. We need extra cash to have a bigger cushion. So they didn’t have an incentive to sell for the best possible price, although of course, they would tell us they’d sell for the best possible price. We’ll give you half our firm, some big percentage of our firm. And so that Tuesday it looked like we would go out of business. Or are they going to realize that they have to bid more in order to beat other people. But sometimes, when you’re so badly off, people realize that they have to stop. And so they waited for us to gradually work ourselves out of the predicament. There’s a crash, a boom, a crash, a boom, a crash, a boom. And by the way, as you’ll see, I spent a lot of time talking to the federal reserve, and Bernanke, and Summers, and also with the ECB, the European Central Bank about the leverage cycle. Maybe we can extend home ownership to still more people. The shareholders of the bank are the people whose money is at risk. Or what the characteristics are of the person who is getting a loan. Think of the securitization when you’re buying a pool. The first one, which some countries haven’t managed to achieve and some people now are doubting we should’ve ever done, is it legal to charge a high interest rate to someone just because they’re riskier. It isn’t necessarily a sign of predatory lending. Even if you thought 40$ of the homeowners would be thrown out of their houses, and 40% of each homeowner was going to be lost in the scenario we just described of the 40% loss, 40% times 40% is only 16%.But the AAA pieces are protected by 8% and then are protected by another 19%, because they’re only the top 81%. By the way, things are even rosier than that, at least looked at from the point of view of 2007 Because remember, 70% of the people were always prepaying. And so I think the credit rating agencies didn’t do such a horrible thing rating these things as people say. CDS they are called, which you’ve heard a lot. And so you can tell how valuable the bonds are. Things seemed to be going so well in the subprime world from the late 80s, early 90s, all through 2000, all through the middle 2000s that people got more ambitious still. Let’s cut those up into different pieces. And then in 2007, there was a tremendous crash. And we’re going to show that everything that I’ve described, although it sounds very much more complicated with subprimes than it did with the prime mortgages earlier, is really when you get down to it, the same story of leverage and crashes and then booms."
271,economics,econ-251,lecture-1,"This lecture gives a brief history of the young field of financial theory, which began in business schools quite separate from economics, and of my growing interest in the field and in Wall Street. A cornerstone of standard financial theory is the efficient markets hypothesis, but that has been discredited by the financial crisis of 2007-09. This lecture describes the kinds of questions standard financial theory nevertheless answers well. It also introduces the leverage cycle as a critique of standard financial theory and as an explanation of the crisis. The lecture ends with a class experiment illustrating a situation in which the efficient markets hypothesis works surprisingly well.","So anyway, the course I’m going to teach is called Financial Theory. It became the most highly paid faculty in the university, although they were all in business schools. There are more physics PhDs working in finance now than there are working in physics. They believed markets left unfettered worked best of all. If you wanted to know whether a country’s doing well or not you don’t have to study its entire political system and current events, just look at the general stock market of the country and that’ll tell you. I mean, anthropologists study primitive tribes and different kinds of people all the time and not one of them, I venture to say, has ever taken over all the language invented by anthropologists to behave themselves in their own societies, but the business people that these professors were studying ended up using exactly the language created in academia. Maybe they were financial economists to begin with. So the greatest Yale economist of the first half of the twentieth century was Irving Fisher who you hear a lot about. So as you know Shiller has been very critical of the business efficient markets tradition. I started off as a straight pure mathematical economist. So I did, and ultimately there were seventy-five people in the department. And what I found was that there are two things missing in the Standard Theory. By the way it’s a little bit better to look at the Dow correcting for inflation and then you see that the 1929 crash looks–and this is on a log scale, remember before the Depression the stock market was so low. So this is a second way in which Shiller became famous. So my theory is when you take a loan you have to negotiate two things, the interest rate and how much collateral you put up. And so what I say is that instead of paying all your attention to the interest rate think about the collateral rate. If the price collapsed part of the reason it collapsed, maybe margins and something had something to do with it, but part of the reason it collapsed was because they knew something bad was happening. So it’s not that I think financial theory, the standard financial theory is wrong I think it’s incredibly useful. I just think it has to be supplemented by a more general and richer theory. The S&P 500 is the green thing which looked like it was doing great for a while. Because they weren’t aware of the leverage cycle, in my view. So it’s hard to see this and to live through that. On the other hand, I’ve lived now through three mortgage crises and so it seems silly for me not to describe how the mortgage market works, even through you’ll find almost none of that in any standard finance textbooks, how the mortgage market works, and what’s going on, and what happened in the crises, and how we survived and how other people didn’t. And then, I want to talk about Social Security. Each generation the young are paying for the old. So Social Security rests on this world going on forever which makes it mathematically interesting. Should you bet on the Yankees with your friends? Half of them take advantage to refinance. The people who are left in the pool are different from the people who started in the pool. So you’ll figure out–we’ll learn how to do that. A scientist discovers a potential cure for AIDS. Now again, if you believe in efficient markets and the market’s really functioning, the prices are fair and all, I’ll bet most of you will say, you won’t know, but you might say it should be random the next time, because firms only did better or worse by luck, but that’s not right either. They don’t pay you take the house or you take the guys life, he’s a slave or something, but it’s the same thing. Were sub-prime mortgages a terrible idea? I’m going to say it’s all the leverage cycle, but anyway so that’s the mortgage crisis. Now, the prerequisites of the course, so I want to make this clear, you don’t really need ECON 115. So what are the kinds of things you have to know? So every Tuesday there’ll be a problem set starting this Tuesday due the next Tuesday. If I can’t get more than it’s worth I won’t sell it.” If I can only get it for forty I’m sure not going to do that because I’m paying more than I think it’s worth. And if that does happen it’ll be very embarrassing for me. When two of you see that there’s a deal you have to shake hands, exchange the football, and leave, and tell your numbers to (TA). You shouldn’t trade–I’m giving you valuable advice–you should not trade in the first ten or fifteen seconds because you have to hear what everybody else is offering. These tickets have lasted ten years until you guys took over. Mister seller ten sold to thirty-six at a price of twenty. And so what happened?All these five people ended up selling, one, two, three, four, five, those are exactly the sellers. So twenty sort of squeezed his way into the market, so twenty-six and twenty between them somehow there was a slight inefficiency."
272,economics,econ-251,lecture-20,"Suppose you have a perfect model of contingent mortgage prepayments, like the one built in the previous lecture. You are willing to bet on your prepayment forecasts, but not on which way interest rates will move. Hedging lets you mitigate the extra risk, so that you only have to rely on being right about what you know. The trouble with hedging is that there are so many things that can happen over the 30-year life of a mortgage. Even if interest rates can do only two things each year, in 30 years there are over a billion interest rate scenarios. It would seem impossible to hedge against so many contingencies. The principle of dynamic hedging shows that it is enough to hedge yourself against the two things that can happen next year (which is far less onerous), provided that each following year you adjust the hedge to protect against what might occur one year after that. To illustrate the issue we reconsider the World Series problem from a previous lecture. Suppose you know the Yankees have a 60% chance of beating the Dodgers in each game and that you can bet any amount at 60:40 odds on individual games with other bookies. A naive fan is willing to bet on the Dodgers winning the whole Series at even odds. You have a 71% chance of winning a bet against the fan, but bad luck can cause you to lose anyway. What bets on individual games should you make with the bookies to lock in your expected profit from betting against the fan on the whole Series?","The subject of today’s lecture is hedging. And thirdly, they charge their investors very high fees. So what you’ve bought and what you’ve sold will cancel each other out and you won’t have lost any money. On the other hand, the value of the mortgage will change with the interest rate, so you want to protect yourself against the interest rate change. So you have some expertise, in fact, there are other people besides you who have the same expertise, these other bookies. The whole point of playing a long series is that the Yankees are more likely to win. Hope I have another one of these World Series things. Okay, would another bookie be willing to give you this bet? In other words, at the odds, P and 1 - P, this is a fair bet, so the other bookie would give you those odds. Some guy is willing to bet on the World Series with you, so you know that he’s done something wrong in his calculations. Life also involves all kinds of other things that might happen. Okay, now suppose that these other brokers weren’t as clever as you. Okay, you can’t go to another broker and say, “I want to bet on the whole 7 game series.” So if you were a trader, a hedge fund manager, you would be marking your position at 42. It may be that the Yankees win, just as you think, but because you’ve hedged, you’re not going to get 100 dollars. So people who don’t hedge I think they’re just very simple minded. The Yankees are up a game and by backward induction we know that then your position will be worth 64 dollars. So by making the right hedging bet, you can lock in a profit up here and up here. Well, the average of here and here is about 9. So now I want to give an example of a bond. But now these are like the World Series, game by game odds. So the price of betting on 1 dollar–what you have to pay to get 1 dollar if interest rates go up is going to be more  here than it is here, say, because you’re going to still have 50 percent chance of getting here, but you’re discounting by a higher interest rate. You don’t know anything more about interest rates than the market does. What you do know is you know something about the prepayments that the market doesn’t know, and so you know the bond is really worth 98 instead of 120. It means that you know you’re going to get a profit of 22 dollars. Because then, having locked in 21.16 times (1 + r), that’s no risk and it’s got the same present value as this and so every period, you want to keep locking your money into 21.16.That’s the gap between that and up there. Because the present value of 98.84 times (1 + r) and 98.84 times (1 + r), 1 half of that + 1 half of that, divided by (1 + r) is 98.84.So therefore the present value of this thing has to be the same as the present value of that thing, and therefore there must be some trade in the derivatives market you can make, where you sell some of these interest rate derivatives and you buy some of these interest rate derivatives, which guarantees you 98.84 in both cases. So to say it all one more time, you have to think of yourself as marking to market. I guess that’s the simplest way of saying it. The essence of what’s going on is that gain-by-gain or month-by-month, you can find someone else who’ll always trade at fair odds with you. They’re not willing to be with you on what prepayments are going to be. So therefore, averaging at the odds the interest rate guy will give you. You want to acquire some assets with this 98.84 dollars that will put you in a position where you have 100.6 dollars up here and 107.1 dollars down there. On the other hand, you could put your 98 dollars in the 1-year bond, which would give you 98.84 times 1.06 and 98.84 times 1.06.So you’ve got this choice, or you can put 100 dollars here and get 106 dollars there. Or at least you don’t know how to trade on it. How do you know you can buy all the cash flows? So I know what combination of the long bond and the short bond to hold so I produce exactly these things. Can you use this amount of money to buy this value at the next step?We saw in the derivatives market, yes you can. Because what you want is 100.6 and 107.11 and that costs 98.84."
273,economics,econ-251,lecture-21,"This lecture reviews the intuition from the previous class, where the idea of dynamic hedging was introduced. We learn why the crucial idea of dynamic hedging is marking to market: even when there are millions of possible scenarios that could come to pass over time, by hedging a little bit each step of the way, the number of possibilities becomes much more manageable. We conclude the discussion of hedging by introducing a measure for the average life of a bond, and show how traders use this to figure out the appropriate hedge against interest rate movements.","So let me begin by reviewing a little bit of the dynamic hedging which I could have described a little bit more clearly last time. He’d be willing to give up 80 dollars if the Yankees won in order to win 120 dollars if the Phillies win, and that’s a fair bet according to the other bookie because it’s 60/40 odds, 60 percent of this and 40 percent of that, this is 3 to 2 odds so it’s a fair bet. So in other words, he makes money by taking advantage of the Philly fan to bet on the Yankees, but that subjects him to risk. So in order to minimize the risk he hedges his bet. Is he making money because he knows the odds are 60/40 and the poor Philly fan thinks they’re 50/50? The Philly fan didn’t demand any money upfront to make this (100, minus 100) bet with him. And with the bookie he’s able to get 20 dollars upfront and make this the opposite bet, the (minus 100, 100) bet. So he’s spent no money at all and his total profit is 20 dollars for sure. So in the dynamic situation what are you doing? So now that’s an even worse bet by the Philly fan if you’re right about the odds because the chances are even higher that the Yankees are going to win the series than one game. So by induction you’ve always locked in where you were before and therefore you’ve locked in 42 all the way along. So it’s a replication argument that by betting sequentially with the bookie different amounts, you’re undoing the single long bet you had with the Philly fan. So the interest rates could follow this process. Why do you deserve to meet this fan and take advantage of him? Maybe the other bookies weren’t willing to bet with him because they didn’t think he was going to pay off if he lost. So that’s the extra thing that you knew, you knew that he was going to pay off. Now, that’s the extra information you have. If other people knew those cash flows they would figure out the price of the mortgage too. You know the cash flows and you can now figure out that the price better be 98.Why–if there’s someone else willing to trade with you to buy that mortgage for more than 98, like why might that happen? So because of that extra information you know the actual cash flows. So how can you lock in your profit?Well, because with 98 dollars at the very beginning you can replicate those cash flows. It’ll be willing to promise you 1 dollar here in exchange for this amount of dollars here. So all this together is enough to make the prepayment because you know she’s going to prepay here. The first interest rate down she’s going to prepay. Just like in the World Series you might have needed the advantage of knowing the Philly fan would actually pay off if he lost. So I decrease my bet going up, I increase it going down. So her question is the game’s going to end after 7 days. That’s 74 dollars and I pay 32 to the original Philly fan so I’m still up 42 dollars. Let’s look at what she’s doing, whether she’s prepaying or not. But with 98.8 I can buy 8 + 92.6 up here and 8 + 99.11 down here. ”And then up here I’ve got the 8 dollars so I can make the payment, match it. Not by 1.06, by the interest rate here which happens to be–you have to figure out what that interest rate was up there. Up here it’s sort of obvious that there aren’t going to be any prepayments. And the proof that it happens is just by induction. So you only have to do things a step at a time. So as long as you held 1 sixth of the bond and something that paid the right constant amount in each case you would get the same payments here and here. So the total I have to spend is 98.8 over here, so if I spend 23 dollars on the Treasury and the remaining amount–23 dollars on the 30 year 9 percent bond, the remaining amount of money which is 75.8 on the Treasury I will have spent this 98.8 dollars, but then I have to get the same payoffs. So in the first year the value is C. The present value is C over (1 + r). Well, if the payments were all equal and no discounting it would be 15, but there’s a huge amount of discounting so that last payment is really pretty irrelevant, so probably–so it’s not clear which way it goes, probably the average life will be less than 15.So you can see just by looking at the bond, and I’m ending with this thought, by looking at the bond itself you can figure out what the average life is."
274,economics,econ-251,lecture-22,"Until now we have ignored risk aversion. The Bernoulli brothers were the first to suggest a tractable way of representing risk aversion. They pointed out that an explanation of the St. Petersburg paradox might be that people care about expected utility instead of expected income, where utility is some concave function, such as the logarithm. One of the most famous and important models in financial economics is the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which can be derived from the hypothesis that every agent has a (different) quadratic utility. Much of the modern mutual fund industry is based on the implications of this model. The model describes what happens to prices and asset holdings in general equilibrium when the underlying risks can’t be hedged in the aggregate. It turns out that the tools we developed in the beginning of this course provide an answer to this question.","Okay, but now I want to move to the next topic, which is the topic called the Capital Asset Pricing Model, and it’s in some points the high point of the class. Well, because if the utility function, say, looks like this–so here’s X and here’s U of X–the more dollars you get, maybe it increases utility but by less and less, so you’re not really gaining much by getting these numbers way out here. So basically he should have said that people care about a concave function of payoff where the function is bounded unlike log which is not bounded. But if you give the person half the amounts of money for sure then he gets this utility which is much bigger than that utility because this is a concave function. The extra you gain by winning the bet, compared to getting the average for sure, the extra you gain doesn’t drive the utility up very much because it’s flattening out. Well, here we have the expectation of X already. Now, what is this 1 F alpha gamma X squared? So that’s just minus 2 times the expectation of X squared. So what are the utilities?Let’s say utility now of alpha is going to equal–sorry, I left out the main point. How should he evaluate the shares of firm B which he could get if he gave up some of A, or how should he evaluate the shares of firm C? So alpha is looking at the expected payoff of what he gets to consume in the future, but he’s punishing himself by the variance. So let me remind you that what we sort of have been supposing up until now is that the price–what would the price of A be if we didn’t think about risk aversion? So any questions about what the question is?We’re about to give an answer. But anyway, apply Fisher trick and assume firm dividends are part of endowments. And that’s going to solve our problem because the prices of the Arrow securities are going to be different, maybe, from the probabilities and that’s what will reflect the fact that when everybody’s trying to hedge and not everybody can do it you’re going to have to change the tradeoffs. So here there’s a reality, 25, 25, 50, but that doesn’t mean that the odds, the prices they’re going to quote in the market are going to turn out to be that. So beta, her marginal utility is 3 quarters and the price is 1. This becomes a 400 and the P gamma went away so I have that. So we’re discounting by 1 over 1 quarter because the interest rate is 300 percent. I said that what we proved by solving for the general equilibrium is that the price in every state was just going to be 1 quarter times the probability. Her consumption is going to be the same in all three states, and his consumption, which will be different from hers, but his will be the same in all three states as well. I want to start hedging and trading these Arrow securities so I get the same constant in every state. So beta will end up bearing more of the risk than alpha. So you’re not discounting the first state at all. We’ve suddenly made our future much worse off. But more interesting is that the prices are no longer proportional to the probabilities. By the way, what is the riskless rate of interest? So far I’ve said stuff which Arrow and Debreu had already figured out, but now I want to go to the thing that Tobin and Markowitz figured out, which is one more step we haven’t noticed yet. Now, what’s not common sense is the extraordinary conclusion I’m about to show you. Let’s look at what the consumption is; the final consumption of these two people. So if we look at the final consumption of these two people, what’s her final consumption, so X. In the three states it’s 200 - 100 times 1 which is 100. The first <>.Which mistake is there here? So now what’s so shocking about those numbers? So that’s the first of the two amazing results and I’ll start next time by explaining it."
275,economics,econ-251,lecture-23,"This lecture continues the analysis of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, building up to two key results. One, the Mutual Fund Theorem proved by Tobin, describes the optimal portfolios for agents in the economy. It turns out that every investor should try to maximize the Sharpe ratio of his portfolio, and this is achieved by a combination of money in the bank and money invested in the “market” basket of all existing assets. The market basket can be thought of as one giant index fund or mutual fund. This theorem precisely defines optimal diversification. It led to the extraordinary growth of mutual funds like Vanguard. The second key result of CAPM is called the covariance pricing theorem because it shows that the price of an asset should be its discounted expected payoff less a multiple of its covariance with the market. The riskiness of an asset is therefore measured by its covariance with the market, rather than by its variance. We conclude with the shocking answer to a puzzle posed during the first class, about the relative valuations of a large industrial firm and a risky pharmaceutical start-up.","So we’re at the point in the course now where we’re talking about the Capital Asset Pricing Model and the economists’ understanding of risk aversion and its consequence for the financial sector. I’ve forgotten what it was, but each boat on a different ocean. I should have called this Shakespeare and this CAPM. Hold an index like the S&P 500, of all the stocks, in proportion to how big they are. If you want to be even more venturesome than that, borrow the money to put the money into the stock market. We know that you have to adjust for risk somehow, which we haven’t taken into account before. You add them all together, what you hold, it only depends on the end about what the expectation and the variance of your final portfolio is. Now the theory, just to get a little ahead of the story, Markowitz went quite a ways, won a Nobel prize many years later for what he did, but didn’t quite get to the end. You’ll be right next to us, but don’t try and get us mixed up with all those mathematical people at the Cowles Foundation. So, the idea is that you like expectation, you hate variance. So the first thing we’re going to do is notice that covariance–I’m sorry, standard deviation is defined as the square root of variance. This is a constant, multiplying the differences from J and its expectation. So I’m assuming you remember that, so those terms just go away. So if you have 2 dice, let’s say the first die will give you–you pay 100 dollars for a dice, you can get 100 + the number of dots showing. So those two things put together are the argument for diversification. Now I don’t want to do too much in the mathematics. Yes, if they were perfectly correlated, you would just be moving along this line by putting your money in between. But no matter how correlated they are, as long as they’re not perfectly correlated, it’s going to turn out the curve you get by moving between them is going to look like that. So that’s a kind of–anyway, it takes a little bit of algebra to prove that, you know, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, but I’m going to skip that. And then it turns out that every other case is sort of in between that or at the other extreme. Let’s say prices of stocks are in equilibrium. So I’ve solved for the equilibrium like we did last time, and I write down X, Q, Y and Z.These are the expectation and standard deviation per dollar of the stocks, or per I dollars of the stock. So R is the return per dollar you put in the asset. Looks very complicated, but it’s going to turn out to be very simple. But the blob is always pushing itself further and further out. Or given this combination of assets that produces this expectation and standard deviation, and given that one up there, I could combine the two and do better than the straight line connecting them, do to the left of it. So Markowitz played around with this, played around with this. If X is riskless, its covariance is going to be 0 with Y. So these terms are going to disappear. Which combination of stocks and bonds would you hold? No matter how risk averse you are or how risk loving you are, you should choose somewhere along this line. If I’m more of a risk lover, I’ll be maybe here, and I’ll choose to put a good fraction of my money in the stock and only a little in the bank. Everybody should do that, put their money in the same combination of risky assets and the riskless asset. It’ll take the guy forever to buy all that stuff and you have to pay a commission on every single thing you buy. That’s why I’m doing great good for society. So the first concrete advice is, the first concrete thing we’ve gotten out of this is, buy the index. Shockingly low, isn’t it, if you look at the history of the stock market–so it depends what year you start and what year you end, if you do it right after a crash or before a crash, but just to pick vague numbers it’s 9 percent and let’s say the interest rate is 4 percent, something like that. That’s the one I like to use, because it’s percent a day. So you could measure Swensen’s Sharpe ratio. You can see who you think is a better manager. Which is = (for variance I could write) is the covariance of this with itself, tX + M. So everybody’s supposed to hold M + some riskless thing, negative or positive in the bond. Because I’ve just rewritten the same thing. And the expectation is good and the covariance is bad."
276,economics,econ-251,lecture-24,"This lecture addresses some final points about the CAPM. How would one test the theory? Given the theory, what’s the right way to think about evaluating fund managers’ performance? Should the manager of a hedge fund and the manager of a university endowment be judged by the same performance criteria? More generally, how should we think about the return differential between stocks and bonds? Lastly, looking back to the lectures on Social Security earlier in the semester, how should the CAPM inform our thinking about the role of stocks and bonds in Social Security? Can the views of Democrats and Republicans be reconciled? What if Social Security were privatized, but workers were forced to hold their assets in a new kind of asset called PAAWS, which pay the holder more if the wage of young workers is higher?","Anyhow, so today I’m going to try and wrap up a few loose ends. So just to wrap up the CAPM, the CAPM had two main ideas. So Markowitz already had that curve and this picture in mind. Everyone should try and get the highest Sharpe ratio. And it relies, of course, on everybody else being rational, so everybody else is choosing the right thing. Then you can just piggyback and do what everybody else is doing. Of course many people beat the market for short periods of time. It depends on the expectation of Y and it depends on the covariance of Y with the market. If it’s more risky people won’t hold it unless it’s got a higher return, which means you can buy it for a cheap price. You got something that looked incredibly close to a straight line like that. So this was the first major triumph, the most important triumph of finance, the Capital Asset Pricing Model. So next week I’m going to end by giving another theory which is going to explain the crisis and be different from this one, but of course it hasn’t been tested over 30 years or 50 years like CAPM.CAPM looked great for the first 20 years, so whatever I say next week will probably turn out to be 90 percent wrong, but at the moment it looks pretty good. Swensen, to take a famous Yale example, is above this line. So instead of Swensen’s Sharpe ratio how much is Ellington going to help the market Sharpe ratio?So that’s how you should measure a hedge fund, its marginal Sharpe ratio, and Swensen by his Sharpe ratio. So of course everybody else has seen that the theory doesn’t work. So my problem about collateral is a different look at it. The price of the Arrow security of this state is going to be much lower than the price of the Arrow security of this state. So this state is going to have a price, let’s say .8, and this one might have a price .2 because here the bad state, that’s when everybody’s poor, so you’re going to, you know, this formula basically tells you that if you’re paying off here you’re negatively correlated with the market, you’re going to have to pay a very high price for it because you’re hedging. And we know that stocks are going to get a higher return than bonds. You put money in stocks, the expected return on stocks is higher than the expected return on bonds. So only young work and wages proportional to dividends, so let’s just assume this, so I’m assuming–this is what’s called neutral technical change. So that’s my complicated world, way more complicated than it was before. Yep?So the down state, the price of consumption is high but the price of land is low? Well, the whole thing is sort of homogeneous and everything, so if the land here is 4 times as good as the land here, the land here is 4 times as good as the land here, because the dividends are always 4 times higher if you go up one thing. In the down case he’s going to have 1 quarter times 3 (that’s his income) divided by P.So to clear this market what do we have to do? So instead of consuming young 3 halves he’s going to consume young 6 halves. This is a very special Cobb-Douglas case where you have endowments only in one good, so it’s clear that in that good you’ll always consume the Cobb-Douglas coefficient fraction of it, 1 half of that, so 3 halves. 1 half + the price of the land you can sell, P.So that’s what the price of land is at 1. So the price of land is going to equal–well, now it’s complicated. Now, with the land he gets a payoff of 2, but he gets to sell the land now for double the price he bought it, namely for 3. The rate of return has gotten really poor for your generation. Even if people make mistakes it’s their own mistake, so let them make mistakes. So in fact I claim that in the long run, and it’s amazing that the Republicans haven’t noticed this, in the long run over 30 or 40 years it’s obvious that the stock market and wages are correlated. We’ll make up for it by giving people money later. If I did it on all income it would be like 1 percent and that fund would pay off for the Social Security legacy. And some countries like Chile decided they’re going to start afresh. So instead of getting 12 percent of your low income you’d get a little more than 12 percent. They can go up or down by a certain percentage. If you take the cumulative occurrence of each thing and compare it to the normal it’s incredibly close to the normal. Actually I did this a couple years ago, so from seven years ago to two years ago."
277,economics,econ-251,lecture-25,"Standard financial theory left us woefully unprepared for the financial crisis of 2007-09. Something is missing in the theory. In the majority of loans the borrower must agree on an interest rate and also on how much collateral he will put up to guarantee repayment. The standard theory presented in all the textbooks ignores collateral. The next two lectures introduce a theory of the Leverage Cycle, in which default and collateral are endogenously determined. The main implication of the theory is that when collateral requirements get looser and leverage increases, asset prices rise, but then when collateral requirements get tougher and leverage decreases, asset prices fall. This stands in stark contrast to the fundamental value theory of asset pricing we taught so far. We’ll look at a number of facts about the subprime mortgage crisis, and see whether the new theory offers convincing explanations.","So I’m going to talk about what led up to the crisis and how the crisis makes us realize that the things about the theory that we’ve been learning all semester that ought to be slightly different, and I’ve been working on a new version of the theory for the last ten years, what I call the Leverage Cycle, which I have to say didn’t get very much attention ten years ago, but which now seems to be, I don’t know, it seems to be getting more attention. So I’m going to tell you the facts and then try to fit a theory to it, and probably will spill over until Thursday, and I think Thursday I won’t spend that much time finishing. I heard a talk about power failures last night, by the way, the power grid which went out all across from Cleveland to Manhattan in 2003, and they said that was an event that should happen once every 10 years. So you should have had 120 dollars of the house to sell so even if the house went down by 33 percent to 80 that’s still only a 20 dollar loss, or let’s say 20 cent loss on the dollar loan, and that 20 cents comes out of the triple-B piece. And so it seemed like they were incredibly safe. Because, as we said, the goal of most investors is to invest in something that’s completely safe, they don’t have to worry about getting more in one state or more in another state. All right, so we talked all about this last time. Yeah, this appears the triple-A of a bad pool, but the people buying the triple-A know exactly what’s in the pool. And if we take this pool, the CDO, these triple-A’s were held mostly by big banks, and you would have thought they were the most sophisticated of all the buyers because they’re the ones creating the pools. So just to put everything in perspective, where else are we? So for 2003, these are Countrywide loans given in 2003. So what was the catastrophe that made the market collapse?Well, this is it. And so it was on that basis, just seeing things getting worse before there were any losses. Hardly anyone’s been thrown out of their house. So you can see how far sighted the market is. It’s like a prepayment like we have in mortgages. And as I told you, most of the sub-prime borrowers are young people who had screwed up with their credit cards and things like that, and after they paid for a while people would realize that they’d settled down and give them a new loan, but look what’s happened to these numbers, so if you jump to 2007 all these things just collapsed, no more prepayments, and once there are no more prepayments that means the lenders don’t get their 70 percent back. So if you’re a hedge fund figuring, “How much can I lose if I buy one of these sub-prime things,” you know that between year two and year three you’re going to get 70 percent of your money back so you can’t lose more than 30 percent. All of a sudden you’re getting 10 percent of your money back which means you could lose 90 percent. And of course so now the stock market has caught on that things are really bad. And that’s exactly what my message is going to be. It’s just different ways of saying the same thing. Now, what is it that’s going to determine leverage?Well, this is common sense as Fisher and Shakespeare before him said that interest rates are determined by impatience. In my view leverage, there are many determinants, but the most important determinant is volatility, the volatility of the asset price. If you make the natural buyers richer you’re not going to need as many of them to buy the assets and the marginal guy will go up here and the price will rise, not because the payoffs of the asset have changed, but because the marginal buyer has gone up. So that’s another crucial ingredient to my theory which I’m not going, you know, in the background here is the idea there’s not insurance for everything. Then they’re going to be willing to pay more than these guys are. For these people, they really want to live in the house. So another thing could be some people just have more expertise. They can analyze the loan level data, and these people don’t have the time, or it gives them a headache, or they don’t know how to find the loan level data to go through, house by house, who the homeowners are and how reliable they are, so naturally they’re going to be scared of buying because they’re going to figure these guys know more than they do. So these are all different reasons why some people would be willing to pay more than other people. It was 100 when it started here in 2000 and it goes up to 190 in 2006. People started getting worried and they started telling everyone the world was coming to an end and the prices went down, and down, and down because we have irrational exuberance. That’s why people were willing to buy such expensive houses because they weren’t actually putting that much money down. So they now monitor every single power line in real time. It’s not because the interest rates were suddenly too high for them. And then the last thing is the CDS market. In this story, remember, I said that the natural buyers, you’d have fewer of them if they could leverage a lot. So in my view and in my opinion what happened was that at end of 2005 the pessimists for the first time were able to bet on the market going down. You couldn’t make the profit that we were talking about before, putting all of these things together and selling off the bonds. Some of you aren’t going to come next time, maybe most of you, so I’ll do how the math changes next time. Number one, you can have a tiny group of people at the top controlling the price, because they can borrow so much money. Now we’ve always assumed that everybody was rational. There are a tremendous number of people, homeowners to name one, who are under water. So 140 means the loans all together, first and second loans are 140 percent of what they estimate the value of the house is. If you’re 160 you’re defaulting at 8 percent. It’s not that people are defaulting because they lost their jobs. It’s just how can they, you know, times are tough. The first one was that there was too little–the most important one is leverage collapse. Housing is the first thing you have to do to lessen the instability and the uncertainty in the economy."
278,economics,econ-251,lecture-26,"In order to understand the precise predictions of the Leverage Cycle theory, in this last class we explicitly solve two mathematical examples of leverage cycles. We show how supply and demand determine leverage as well as the interest rate, and how impatience and volatility play crucial roles in setting the interest rate and the leverage. Mathematically, the model helps us identify the three key elements of a crisis. First, scary bad news increases uncertainty. Second, leverage collapses. Lastly, the most optimistic people get crushed, so the new marginal buyers are far less sanguine about the economy. The result is that the drop in asset prices is amplified far beyond what any market participant would expect from the news alone. If we want to mitigate the fallout from a crisis, the place to begin is in controlling those three elements. If we want to prevent leverage cycle crashes, we must monitor leverage and regulate it, the same way we monitor and adjust interest rates.","What I’m planning to do today is to spend a half an hour or less just telling you a little bit about what a new theory might be, what I call the Leverage Cycle, and then spend the rest of the time maybe answering questions about the course that you might have. Either the Y, the oil well, could produce–it’s a gold-well really. Now, this is stuff that we haven’t really paid much attention to before. The most pessimistic person thinks the oil well is only worth .2. So that’s nothing different from what we’ve done from the very beginning except that maybe the one difference is people would go to the extreme. So he’d spend all his money in oil wells and these guys would sell all their oil wells, but other than that it’s very similar to what we’ve done. Everybody assumed they were going to get paid back, but in reality people don’t assume they’re going to get paid back. Much simpler is to use the asset Y as collateral. So that’s the dollar of Y divided by the cash down. So you have to conceptually figure out how to think about the problem. I owe so much more on my house than the house is worth. I can’t do anything with the house anyway. It’s like 14 percent or 15 percent actually. So effectively you’re promising a 15 percent interest. There are many different loans and each of them sells for a different price. When you say cigarettes you’re talking about gold? Cigarettes you can consume now or consume later. So the total amount of gold that they have at their disposal is .31 + .2, and how many oil wells do they have to buy, 69 percent of the oil wells, .69.And if you take 31 and 20 that’s 51 over 69, which is about .75, which is exactly what I said the price is that’s going to make this guy, Mr. 69, exactly indifferent to buying or selling. For the first state if you only promise to pay .2 in the future, so shouldn’t the price be .2 right now? So anyway, I don’t have time work it all out, but if you think it through you’ll realize that nobody wants to do this trade, because the guys at the top who seem to have the greatest advantage in borrowing more, when they borrow more in this way where they’re defaulting, they’re actually paying more only in the state that they think is going to occur and the people doing the lending are getting money only in the state they think won’t occur. So as the price gets much lower more people would want to buy and you would have the marginal buyer down here, and there’d be a much lower price. It seems like the most obvious thing in the world and commonsensical thing in the world, but remember it never got mentioned in this course, right? So of course when the first down state happens everybody gets more pessimistic including Mr. 87. He now thinks that the asset value maybe went from 98 to 87, which is an 11 point drop, and everybody’s going to have a drop. That’s way bigger than anybody could imagine is justified by the bad news in the economy, yet that’s what the equilibrium becomes, from 95 percent to 69 percent. Now, why did it crash to .69?It crashed because look what happened. One is they got bad news, so the people who are left don’t think it’s worth as much as they did from the beginning. I can get 40 percent return, 31 over 69, whatever that is. Mr. .75, for example, also thinks the asset is worth more than .95 at the beginning, but he doesn’t buy either, so all these people, the cautious optimists, they’re holding out for the crash and the crash would be much worse without them, but they don’t eliminate the crash because there are not enough of them. So here are the three classes of people you were thinking about. When they see the first piece of bad news they’re more pessimistic. You have to contain the bad news, that’s A. So you can’t eliminate the bad news, but you can contain the volatility of the bad news. Now, I think that the Fed should be monitoring this, and not only should be monitoring it, should be making it as public as the interest rates are. So let me answer your question in two parts. I think that’s the whole point of the crisis that the things feedback on each other. Presents, so this is Jerusalem, I gave this talk in Jerusalem. It was shocking how bad and how fast it was. They were already anticipating this spiral. They can’t stop themselves from investing. How receptive are the regulators to this idea? Remember, I said that the way to solve the housing foreclosure problem is reducing principal. And I believe that once they have all these numbers they’re going to start to think differently."
279,economics,econ-251,lecture-2,"This lecture explains what an economic model is, and why it allows for counterfactual reasoning and often yields paradoxical conclusions. Typically, equilibrium is defined as the solution to a system of simultaneous equations. The most important economic model is that of supply and demand in one market, which was understood to some extent by the ancient Greeks and even by Shakespeare. That model accurately fits the experiment from the last class, as well as many other markets, such as the Paris Bourse, online trading, the commodities pit, and a host of others. The modern theory of general economic equilibrium described in this lecture extends that model to continuous quantities and multiple commodities. It is the bedrock on which we will build the model of financial equilibrium in subsequent lectures.","So for those of you who weren’t here yesterday–or, last class, first class, I’ll say a couple words about what happened, basically four words. So there’s a very powerful argument in economics. And for quite a while it’s given me some great embarrassment to have been part of it all. In economics you have to worry about what you know, what the other guy knows, what you know about what he knows about what you know etcetera. And so I’m going to take advantage of that simplicity and every problem is going to have a number that you’re supposed to find. They’re just the weather and things like that. So the theory is couched in terms of equilibrium. From the counterfactual reasoning you’re making predictions. So Malthus, who you’ve also heard of, a contemporary of his and his rival but also his friend, said, “This model stuff is ridiculous because if you start making a model the point of a model is to make deductions from it, and to analyze it, and analyze it deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and of course the model to begin with is going to be wrong and as you go deeper and deeper into the analysis of the model the error that you made at the beginning is going to get compounded.” ”Anyway, that’s what you might think is wrong with models, and the very first model was critiqued by that reasoning, but it’s turned out historically that modeling is the way to make progress in economics and everybody does modeling now. There’s the commodities futures just like the experiment we ran where people yell at each other. So the first people who had these well-developed markets and money were the Lydians. And for the last ten or twenty years many economists have run these sorts of experiments. I’ve done this experiment now ten or twenty times and I would say that half the time somebody buys something for more than it’s worth to them. And then there’s the senator who you sort of hardly ever see, but you know he’s the good senator who somehow–he appears a few times–you know that he’s a good guy and he’s going to take over. And Hamilton said that that would be terrible, that the reputation of the country was going to be made at what happened at the very founding of the country and it was important that the U.S. never break a debt. The people who originally bought the bonds, who lent the money to the government, the farmers who did it they didn’t own the bonds any more. She’s going to lie and say the thing is much more. I certainly don’t want to go to a football game. That’s the facts, now you need a model and a theory that fits the facts, and I’m belaboring the obvious, but the obvious is always central to everything, the obvious theory would go something like, well, somehow these people are going to get matched up and maybe thirty-eight will sell to forty-four and all eight things will be sold. And what else might a theory say, a wrong theory? So the economic theory is quite a shocking theory, I think. Nobody even thinks they have any chance of changing the price. Does anyone want to make a comment or ask a question about this theory? I already told you the exogenous variables are the reservation values. The endogenous variable is the price that emerges and who buys and who sells. Looks like the buyers are now more desperate to buy, won’t have any effect on the price. Now one more thing, one last thing, one last message of this model, if you didn’t know–we knew the reservation prices ourselves because I set up the experiment, but if you didn’t know it you could infer something from the price. So part of finance is going in the backwards direction. We have to think of many commodities, not just one. And then we have to put in financial things. Well, from this utility function you have to say if I bought one ticket I’d have a utility of forty-four minus–let’s say my utility function now is U of X and money is this function of X. I’ll call this U of X. I don’t want to write it out. So this is exactly the kind of situation we had before. It could have been money before and with football tickets. But anyway, so they have different tastes, different utility functions, and different endowments. So that’s the budget set of agent i. And in the diagram the budget set–I’m out of colors that show up I think–all the others got vetoed, I think orange was okay–the budget set, then, will be something that looks like this. What has to be the case?The first equation is going to be that the final consumptions of everybody have to equal the final endowments because everyone who buys has to be met by another seller. So this total endowment E, I add over every person i what the total endowment is. And now the fifth one–so now we have the two mysterious equations that are left."
280,economics,econ-251,lecture-3,"Our understanding of the economy will be more tangible and vivid if we can in principle explain all the economic decisions of every agent in the economy. This lecture demonstrates, with two examples, how the theory lets us calculate equilibrium prices and allocations in a simple economy, either by hand or using a computer. In future lectures we shall extend this method so as to compute equilibrium in financial economies with stocks and bonds and other financial assets.","Now, the course, just to summarize again, the course is the standard financial theory course that was made popular over the last ten years in a bunch of business schools, and those guys who developed this material basically thought that markets were great and finance was almost a separate part–could be walled off from much of economics. The answers are going to go on the web right after the class, and so it’s just in the past we negotiated with every person who was late and it’s just too complicated. You had to announce publically and loudly what price you were offering. Maybe it would take a couple days to process on everybody’s books. Well, each person, i, has a different utility function, and so if you add up over all the people i you get the total welfare of every single person, the economy’s total welfare. Well, whatever the money distribution was you couldn’t change total welfare, because if i gives up some of his money to her, to j, the total amount of money is still the same, and if you add up the welfares of all the people you’re just going to get the total amount of money on the right and it won’t make any difference. So Mr. 26 and Miss 24, they’re the ones who controlled the price, what 44 thought was totally irrelevant, so that was why it was called the marginal revolution in economics. The marginal value of water is low even though the total value, which is the area under the demand curve, is very high. And in the end the football tickets have ended in the hands of the people who liked them the most. So the theory is going to say, how do you go from exogenous to endogenous and it’s going to be just a bunch of equations, so what do they each want to do?So A is going to maximize W of X and Y such that, as we said, the critical insight, the budget constraint–[clarification: here, writes but does not say out loud PX] + P Y is less than or equal to P times E + P times E), but we know what these numbers are. And similarly Y is going to be maximizing over X and Y, W of X, Y such that P X + P Y less than or equal to P times 80 + P times 1,000. I think I remembered the numbers finally. Until his dying day he was trying to understand what these marginalist guys were doing. Otherwise he would have moved a dollar from one thing to the other thing. So you have to think about what the other people are doing before you can decide what to do yourself. And they based their argument on an argument that Nash had given for games. And so Aumann says, “That question reminds me,”–I can’t do his Israeli accent–“that question reminds me of the first press conference Khrushchev”–who you might remember was Premier of the Soviet Union. You’ll see in one minute you can solve this on a computer, but by hand it’s worth knowing how to do and you probably know how to do this, but let me describe it. Walras, by the way, was the first who made this argument. So Walras was one of the marginalists in 1871 from Lausanne. We haven’t checked equation two though, whether that market’s going to clear. We got rid of one equation and we got rid of one unknown. So we got rid of the top equation, let’s say, and P. One of those two equations, the market clearing equations, doesn’t matter as long as we do all the others, and one of the prices we can fix at 1. And now we don’t have to worry about the other market. Well, we have to write down all the equations. So it’s embarrassing to make all these mistakes, but you’ll find in 30 years you’ll start making mistakes too. Almost, so there’s another trick to doing this. So the total consumption of X has to be 3. I said I can always take P to be 1, and if I take P to be 1 I’m going to get this income is P  1 times 1 which is just 1, so 3 quarters of this divided by P, that’s what he’s buying. So I just add and do a little algebra and lo and behold P is equal to 5 halves. But then we have to examine the question, have we really maximized utility here, and to give away the punch line, that utility was very special. So let’s just take the second example here. These are the endogenous variables and wild guesses about the solution. So you want all these equations to be equal to zero. So this marginal utility stuff is all screwed up. If I change the endowments I’ll get a different answer, and if I increase the endowments yes it does and that’s very important."
281,economics,econ-251,lecture-4,"Over time, economists’ justifications for why free markets are a good thing have changed. In the first few classes, we saw how under some conditions, the competitive allocation maximizes the sum of agents’ utilities. When it was found that this property didn’t hold generally, the idea of Pareto efficiency was developed. This class reviews two proofs that equilibrium is Pareto efficient, looking at the arguments of economists Edgeworth and Arrow-Debreu. The lecture suggests that if a broadening of the economic model invalidated the sum of utilities justification of free markets, a further broadening might invalidate the Pareto efficiency justification of unregulated markets. Finally, Professor Geanakoplos discusses how Irving Fisher introduced two crucial ingredients of finance–time and assets–into the standard economic equilibrium model.","So we have begun by talking about general equilibrium, and this was the background to the course so that you’re all familiar. In the first example you’ve got two agents A and B, and whenever we write agents A and B we really mean a million agents just like A and a million agents just like B. The heart of perfect competition in the economy is that there’s lots of people, and so we can’t–yeah, I think from now on hand them in at the end of class. So what’s so good about that economic solution? So we’ve now ignored all the constraints. Whenever you take a verbal argument like Adam Smith and turn it into a mathematical argument you’ve understood it better. The skin texture changes as you become less and more aroused. So the chief among them, Hicks, Samuelson, Pareto and Fisher, all these people basically came to the same conclusion. He chose to do something else and he was better off and the same with B, so clearly the equilibrium allocation is going to be better than the initial endowment. If and only if everybody’s better off: W (X-hat, Y-hat) is bigger than W(X, Y). So the equilibrium allocation Pareto dominates the initial allocation. So the theorem is that if P, (X Y), i in I is an equilibrium for the economy E–remember we defined the economy E, I better put E here–then no allocation (X-hat, Y-hat), i in I, Pareto dominates (X, Y) if summation X–hat equals summation E and summation–got a little too tight here, sorry about this, Y–hat equals, this is over i, equals summation E. So I can read this, it’s really bad. From this equilibrium you could increase the sum by taking something away from A and giving it to B. You could increase the sum. So are there any questions about this?You all supposedly saw this before, but that doesn’t mean you really did. Could you just re-say the theorem a little bit more slowly? That’s sort of the budget set that he faces. B, whose budget line is the same budget line looked at from his point of view, he went from his indifference curve over here to one here. They are consuming only on the boundaries. But I believe what he just said is what really happens in a lot of regulation is they come in and they change the prices. So you could say this equilibrium is not very socially desirable because A ends up with more of everything than B does or at least as much of everything as B does, and that seems unjust and unfair and so we don’t like the allocation, and so maybe we should move something from A to B.So that’s an argument on the basis of justice. This should be an elementary question for you. Getting one ticket might not be worth much because you don’t want to go alone. He decided that he wanted to build a financial equilibrium model. And so Fisher’s PhD dissertation was basically reinventing this general equilibrium model that I’ve just described and then making a machine to calculate equilibrium with water and pumps and water seeking its own level and solving for equilibrium. He became the most famous economist probably in the country for a while. Roosevelt says, “I’m very glad that the good professor has made such worthy recommendations and we’ll certainly take them seriously.” Then he’d count how many pushups they could do. So the first thing–of course you may have read ahead in the notes, but that’s a brilliant insight if it’s yours. So far we just had apples and oranges or something being traded. Fisher, you’ll see, had something to say about time and impatience that people always care more about the present than the future. That is what most people think about, so money. We’re going to talk about inflation and stuff like that, but we’re not going to explain where the inflation comes from. So the asset is no different from what its dividend is going to be. So we’ve made the model a bit more complicated. So to the old economy we add something new. So this is going to turn out to be 1 + the real interest rate, Fisher would call it."
282,economics,econ-251,lecture-5,"Philosophers and theologians have railed against interest for thousands of years. But that is because they didn’t understand what causes interest. Irving Fisher built a model of financial equilibrium on top of general equilibrium (GE) by introducing time and assets into the GE model. He saw that trade between apples today and apples next year is completely analogous to trade between apples and oranges today. Similarly he saw that in a world without uncertainty, assets like stocks and bonds are significant only for the dividends they pay in the future, just like an endowment of multiple goods. With these insights Fisher was able to show that he could solve his model of financial equilibrium for interest rates, present value prices, asset prices, and allocations with precisely the same techniques we used to solve for general equilibrium. He concluded that the real rate of interest is a relative price, and just like any other relative price, is determined by market participants’ preferences and endowments, an insight that runs counter to the intuitions held by philosophers throughout much of human history. His theory did not explain the nominal rate of interest or inflation, but only their ratio.","So this is really the beginning of the finance part of the course. All the great religions of the world crystallizing, obviously, some of the most important thinking of the time, frowns on interest, so just to remind you of a few. He’s making a profit without having exerted any effort whatsoever. Of course, “unto a foreigner thou mayest lend upon usury, but unto a brother thou shalt not lend upon usury.” So the Jews could lend to Christians but not to each other. So these religions that forbade it at the same time knew that it was going on and allowed it to go on and sometimes participated in it. Just let’s do something mathematical and concrete. So we’ll call the production of the stock–so what is the future?There are only apples in the future. Let’s suppose they actually get it right and they know what the price of the stock is next period. And of course people are going to decide what they want to do, X, what they’re going to end up consuming X, X, X, but now we’ve got a more complicated world. This is the price of stock A, stock alpha. And this is original ownership by B of stock alpha. Well, the first thing is just common sense. They can spend money, so I’m going to look at the budget set for Agent i, and i can be A or B so I don’t have to write it twice. Now, how much does it cost me to buy shares? Well, you bought theta to begin with so that’s D. So if you bought the whole tree then you’ve got all the dividends, and similarly with beta. And so that’s part of what the consumption is going to be in the economy. And the reason is that when you buy a stock you’re buying it not for the dividends at this same moment in time. So there’s no point in putting down what people are buying of the stocks or selling or anything. Why are there endowments in period 1 and <>? You mean why do people have endowments today and next year? If the price of apples next year is bigger than this year we’ve got inflation. So already the model, you’re talking about inflation. In equilibrium what’s going to have to happen? Suppose after finding the equilibrium I added a third asset that paid 1 dollar in period 2 next year. So this world is going to have an interest rate in it. So you’re selling something you don’t even have. We can simplify it all and be back to where we were before and yet talk about finance. Suppose the stock of alpha, suppose the price turns out to be a half. So all of stock alpha pays 1 dividend in the future, so really A effectively has claim on two apples in the future and another half of beta which is another apple in the future, so really A’s initial endowment of goods is (1, 3).How did I get that again? And E-hat2, well his 1 doesn’t change today, but what’s his claim, effectively, on dividends in the future? But without uncertainty, with perfect foresight and so on, and no uncertainty, Fisher says this is an easy problem to solve. So he’s going to spend 2 thirds of his money on the first good. It’s as if they’re present value prices today. Do we typically expect the price in the 2nd period to be lower than the price in the 1st period? In the future the money you’re spending on goods in the future you’re going to get the dividends paid, of course you can sell the dividends for money and the price is q. So a q has to appear over here just like there’s a q over there. That’s the money you’re getting in the future, and that’s the money you’re spending on the good X. Very good, too bad you didn’t ask me that a while ago, but anyway. That doesn’t look right, so maybe I did this wrong. And he said that was a variable that you should pay a lot of attention to. If you own twice as much of the alpha tree you get exactly the same as having the beta tree. So it does not explain inflation, and it does not explain who holds which stock, and so it does not explain the nominal rate of interest."
283,economics,econ-251,lecture-6,"Building on the general equilibrium setup solved in the last week, this lecture looks in depth at the relationships between productivity, patience, prices, allocations, and nominal and real interest rates. The solutions are given to three of Fisher’s famous examples: What happens to interest rates when people become more or less patient? What happens when they expect to receive windfall riches sometime in the future? And, what happens when wealth in an economy is redistributed from the poor to the rich?","All right, so we spent a long time reviewing general equilibrium and we’ve now switched to finance, and you’re hopefully going to see that the principles of finance emerge very quickly from the principles of general equilibrium. So the labor endowments are given by (1, 1) for A, and (1, 0) for B.And then they also know that there are two stocks in the economy and they have to anticipate what the dividends are going to be. Anyway, he figured out all the consumptions. None of this is relevant, what the business plan is. If they sold for a different price there’d be an arbitrage. If the price is less than a dollar this year you’re turning something less than a dollar into something equal to a dollar. Now, I told you that equilibrium–Fisher says there’s always a normalization. That means that inflation 1 + (let’s call it growth of money) g–i, I’ve already used for the nominal interest rate. This is a big mystery in finance, a big question in finance. So assuming q is 1, another way of saying that is 1 over 1 + i times D times q. So you take the nominal rate of interest times the money that’s being produced, because the nominal rate of interest says how do you trade off a dollar today for a dollar in the future? We have to know what the nominal interest rate is. So what is the real rate of interest now? We’re going to find out that that’s not the reason they’re doing it at all. They just leave their money in the banks getting no interest. So we’re going to come back to that what’s really going on today, but that’s what’s going on. This is the equilibrium we solved over here already. The value after the new technology is introduced in that new economy has only gone down compared to the Fisher economy, and the Fisher economy value of endowments must have been less than this brilliant new allocation, and that’s a contradiction because this new allocation has to add up to the stuff that’s there in the new technology economy. So if and only if it makes a profit can it be used to make everybody better off, and amazingly, in a free market economy, people are going to use it if and only if it makes a profit. So let me just put this in perspective a little bit. I’m just having a very hard time reading. So if the new technology, if Mr. A invents the new technology, he gives up some of his good at time 1 to get more of the good at time 2, so his endowment has changed–but he’s got a new endowment, but it’s still his endowment. So the contradiction is the value of the new endowment after the technology is used, at the old equilibrium prices, is lower than the value of the old endowment at the old equilibrium prices. So we get as a conclusion that, putting it another way, that owners of firms should maximize the value of their firms, the stock market value of their firms, and thank God they do because if they find some new way of producing that’s going to lose money it’s going to make the stock market value go down. Remember the stock market value is just the same calculation, the value of all the output they’re producing. The proof is clever precisely because of what you’re asking. It was horrible even though, of course, lots of people in Greece were charging interest. The Delphic oracle was charging interest and they were saying it’s totally unnatural. It’s the real rate of interest that you care about, and the real rate of interest doesn’t have to be positive. So the common sense maybe is enough for you. So the reason I gave the formal argument is because you can get confused here. Now, how can you actually give a formal proof of that so you know you’re not confused? So is that clear?It’s a little surprising, so let me say that again. We have to make an extra assumption here. Fisher felt that the people who were rich were rich because they were patient. So what happens to the stock market in this case? So the price that the market finds is the just price and the real rate of interest is the right real rate of interest provided that people are rational and see through this veil."
284,economics,econ-251,lecture-7,"While economists didn’t have a good theory of interest until Irving Fisher came along, and didn’t understand the role of collateral until even later, Shakespeare understood many of these things hundreds of years earlier. The first half of this lecture examines Shakespeare’s economic insights in depth, and sees how they sometimes prefigured or even surpassed Irving Fisher’s intuitions. The second half of this lecture uses the concept of present value to define and explain some of the basic financial instruments: coupon bonds, annuities, perpetuities, and mortgages.","We started summarizing what general equilibrium was. We had the idea of arbitrage and no arbitrage so you could deduce a lot of prices without solving for the whole equilibrium just by knowing what other prices are. And so for several lectures now I’m going to leave the abstract theory of general equilibrium and start teaching you some of the basic vocabulary of finance that you have to know and that everybody in finance knows like what is a mortgage, what’s an annuity and stuff like that. He said interest is crystallized impatience. Now, when I was your age or a little bit younger than you in high school we all had to read the . They can recite almost the entire thing by heart. While we were there I asked him about the  and whether he happened to remember the rate of interest that Shylock ends of charging Antonio, and he said, “Dear boy, I remember almost everything, but that I’ve forgotten.” Anyway, so Shylock lends the money, 3,000 ducats, and it’s so much money he has to borrow it from another money lender named Tubal who’s even richer than he is. And then the second thing he’s noticed, which Irving Fisher didn’t notice at all, and this is going to be a large part of the rest of the course, how do we know these people are going to keep their promises. So what happens is after getting his money Bassanio then goes to woo fair Portia. Well, it turns out the way that her fabulously wealthy father has set up the marriage is, there are three caskets, a gold one, a silver one and a lead one, and he has to pick one, and one of them contains her picture, and if you get the one with her picture you get to marry her. And so he yells, “My daughter, my ducats.” He believes in keeping promises unlike everybody else in the play, his daughter, everybody as we’ll see. He doesn’t understand the whole point of a lending contract and getting interest, and basically he says–I’ve got to skip over this a little quickly. So this is another contract broken, another default. So I’m going to now follow pretty closely what the notes are. So let’s take the simplest case where pi is a constant interest rate. So the first thing to realize is what Fisher calls the present value price. If there were some asset that paid off money in the future, m through m, you don’t have to solve the whole equilibrium to figure out what its price would be if you knew the prices of these zeros, pi through pi. Then you could make the payments of the bond because the promises would come due to you. So the doubling rule says how many years at i percent interest does it take to double your money. You look at the top you see that’s the B1 number, and I’ve just multiplied it by the interest rate, 1.06, and so I keep doing that. So anyway, after 12 years you see that 24 dollars, this is year 1, so at year 12, 24 dollars has become 48. So at 7 percent interest you should do this in your head now. So there are 360 years, about, 360 is a very round number, so 360 divided by 72 over 7 that’s 5 times 7, it’s 35. So 2 to the thirty-fifth, well it’s like a billion times 2 to the fifth which is 32. I mean, if you look at our Indian investment of 24 and you look–I don’t know how many years you want to look over, but you can look over 36 years. So a typical–you’re putting money away right now. They charge a fee that sounds small, but it adds up over a few years and it amounts to a huge amount of money. Now you can also imagine keeping a bond forever paying 6 percent interest. So these annuities are famous in history. So you could call it C over r for the real rate of interest, whatever. So this is a very famous formula for the value of an annuity. So we’re going to lose all this future stuff, but the future’s not worth very much. But because the interest rate’s so high the stuff after 30 years isn’t very important. Each year for only 30 years it depends on how much you’re giving up at that end. So the fact is you care about the real rate of interest. If I divide this by this these numbers are so close to 1 that I’m basically just subtracting the bottom from the–the denominator from the numerator. So it’s worth 5 million reduced because it’s not a perpetuity, it’s only an annuity for 30 years and so it’s worth 2.5 million. I mean, not today but after looking at it by next time you’ll be able to do that in your head. So this professor can figure out what you should do. You have to pay for them the entire time. So I said, “How much would every generation, not just today, but forever in the future have to consume less in order to make up for this one shot problem, this deferred maintenance that a couple generations of Yale presidents didn’t put in?”So in other words, I would figure out the present value of the 10 year $100 mil annuity, and then I would set that equal to what coupon perpetuity gives you the same present value."
285,economics,econ-251,lecture-8,"In the 1990s, Yale discovered that it was faced with a deferred maintenance problem: the university hadn’t properly planned for important renovations in many buildings. A large, one-time expenditure would be needed. How should Yale have covered these expenses? This lecture begins by applying the lessons learned so far to show why Yale’s initial forecast budget cuts were overly pessimistic. In the second half of the class, we turn to the problem of measuring investment performance, and examine the strengths and weaknesses of various measures of yield, including yield-to-maturity and current yield.","So we’re spending a couple classes these days learning basic facts and vocabulary about finance, and along the way we’re trying to apply the simple lessons that Irving Fisher taught about turning a financial problem into a general equilibrium problem and making use in particular of the budget set. So let’s stick with the 5 percent which is what the white paper, take all the assumptions of the white paper and take it literally, and then notice that they never said anything about inflation. And the answer that was given down here is that I’m assuming that Yale is going to go on forever. So by reducing your expenditures by 5 percent every year you defray the 772 million dollar loss. Like suppose you had to spend an extra 100,000 dollars in one day. And of course not, so you have to spread the loss over the lifetime of the university. I would have to cut my expenditures by exactly the money I was pouring into the buildings. So I took them literally what they meant. It’s now back a little bigger than it was before. Hard to do these things in your head, right, but what is it? Firing faculty, well, I hope they don’t do that. I think they learned their lesson so I doubt if they’ll do that. We know at 30 years at 2.3 percent, 2.3 percent doubles almost in 30 years. So of course when inflation went up and everybody knows it’s up the mortgage companies are going to ask for higher annual payments so it’d be 6,000 a year instead of 4,600 a year. So let’s just go to the hedge fund all together. So what happens in the beginning of the next year, year 3, well let’s say our guy–so the hedge fund makes money and this time it made 3 percent, a crappier, sorry, a less good return, only 3 percent. The second guy’s got 1,030 in the fund, and the third guy’s got 206 in the fund and the total fund is 1,346, Now let’s suppose that our guy, this is the beginning of year 3, our first guy says, “3 percent, that’s a terrible return. So at the end of the year now he’s down to zero and everybody else is where they were and the hedge fund thing has gone down a little bit. If you had to pick one number what would it be? The crucial thing to take into account is that suppose you have a fund that starts off, many funds like my fund started off with very little money, but we did it at the right time because we knew that was a good time. So I wouldn’t have expected you to be able to answer that. So as for producing money it produced a negative 100. So you could say, what interest rate could you discount all the cash flows at to produce 0?That would be like saying at that interest rate, all the fund has done is rearranged its money. So that’s the simple way of averaging, dollar weighting everything. Now very typically this is the case that this internal rate of return is lower than the dollar return from putting the money in at the beginning, assuming the fund doesn’t just collapse and go to zero at the end. And so the average dollar didn’t do that well, and now there’s a question about how should you measure the average dollar, and I’ve given the internal rate of return. So what if the price were 100 what would the yield to maturity be? But I told you the price was 105, which is a lot more expensive. So that number that he gave is called the current yield. So we could go 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, and 107. So again, there’s probably some clever way of doing this. Very good, so I see that preparing this would have helped. And now we want to square this, equals up squared enter and now we’ll do Solver. So some price which will be the present value will be greater than 100, obviously, because it’s paying–if the interest rate’s only 6 percent this is giving you more than 100.Now, the current yield is 7 over the present value, exactly analogous to what he said. So if someone calls you on the phone, you haven’t gotten these calls yet, but when you get older you’ll get–they’re screened now, so it’s harder to get these, but it used to be a few years ago you’d get called on the phone quite often and somebody would say he’s running a bond fund, and the bond fund is really doing great, and he wants to tell you that the bonds they have in the fund last year paid a current yield of 7 over the present value which is much bigger than the interest rate of 6 percent, and therefore you should buy his bonds. At your bank you’re only getting 6 percent, so therefore you should invest in my fund. ”Is that a good argument to invest in his fund?"
286,economics,econ-251,lecture-9,"Where can you find the market rates of interest (or equivalently the zero coupon bond prices) for every maturity? This lecture shows how to infer them from the prices of Treasury bonds of every maturity, first using the method of replication, and again using the principle of duality. Treasury bond prices, or at least Treasury bond yields, are published every day in major newspapers. From the zero coupon bond prices one can immediately infer the forward interest rates. Under certain conditions these forward rates can tell us a lot about how traders think the prices of Treasury bonds will evolve in the future.","All right, so last time we began, or maybe two times ago, we began a discussion of various vocabulary and facts you have to know about the markets if you want to think about finance. Use the market interest rates and figure out what the present value of all the cash flows is. Why do they quote the yield?Well, that’s just because, you know, a hundred years ago, people started using the idea of yield and so the vocabulary has been kept, even though it’s not the best way of describing what’s going on. You would see that in December 2000, the yield on the 1-year bonds, you know, the short yields–this isn’t a log scale, so this is 3, 6, 12, okay. Now what do you notice about this picture, by the way? But in the intervening time, the long rates have started to go way up. A 1-year bond, a 2-year bond, a 3-year bond, a 4-year bond and a 5-year bond. So let’s say, when they actually market these, and supply equals demand in equilibrium, the prices turn out to be 100.1, 100.2, 100.3, 100.4, and 100.5. So the correct price P is just whatever the cash flows you’re predicting times these pis that Fisher says is what you should really be finding. You could have bought those cash flows yourself by paying this price. So we just need to figure out how to deduce what the little pis are from the data that we’re going to be given, and that we are given every day by the market. So buying a Treasury bond, you need the cash to buy it. Okay, so how do you buy 1 dollar next year? They’re all basically similar ideas here. Tell me the reason why you want to do something else. It’s that number, so I’m getting– so is that correct, what I’ve written here? Okay, so does everybody see what’s going on here? How can you sell off this amount of money in year 2? Well, this is the amount of money you have to get. You’re not following what the right thing to do is, but let’s just say in words what we’ve done. So knowing those little pis, you can evaluate the price of anything, just by multiplying the little pis by the cash flows in the future. Then we have to sell a certain amount of the 2-year Treasury, because we accumulated extra coupons. And maybe nobody’s coming to you and offering a stupid deal like that. So please interrupt if you’re not following this logic. If you knew pi (1) and pi (2), you could figure out the price of the zero coupon bond–I mean, of the 2 year Treasury bond, because 2 dollars at time 1 cost 2 pi (1) and 102 dollars at time 2 cost 102 pi (2). So rather than doing this complicated stuff, trying to figure out the pis, assume you had the pis. What do you think the bank’s going to tell me?Every bank will give me the same answer, if that yield curve–given this morning, and that was this morning’s yield curve, if I ask every bank in the world, “I’ll give you 1 dollar in year 2, you tell me how many dollars you’ll be willing to give me–” So what am I doing? We already know how much more 1 dollar at time 2 is worth than 1 dollar at time 3. Good question, but let me phrase your question a little differently, so you see the answer to it. So this is what would appear in the newspaper. The 1-year yield is a little under 1 percent. So the forwards have gone up much faster than the yields. From these pictures, they can deduce the pis. Could you make this all real interest rates by doing this for TIPS?: Okay, so just what you said, but just said a little bit more precisely. The second half of the course is going to be dealing with uncertainty. That interest rates are going to keep going up.: That interest rates are going to go up and go up a lot. They’re going to go up–the forward rates are going up much faster than that, so we could have computed what they think. Okay, so I’ve got one more surprising conclusion to end this. You need to answer this to do the problem set."
287,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-10,"The markets for debt, both public and private far exceed the entire stock market in value and importance. The U.S. Treasury issues debt of various maturities through auctions, which are open only to authorized buyers. Corporations issue debt with investment banks as intermediaries. The interest rates are not set by the Treasury, the corporations or the investment bankers, but are determined by the market, reflecting economic forces about which there are a number of theories. The real and nominal rates and the coupons of a bond determine its price in the market. The term structure, which is the plot of yield-to-maturity against time-to-maturity indicates the value of time for points in the future. Forward rates are the future spot rates that can be calculated using today’s bond prices. Finally, indexed bonds, which are indexed to inflation, offer the safest asset of all and their price reveals a fundamental economic indicator, the real interest rate.","Before I begin, I just wanted to say that I was very — I found last period’s lecture with David Swensen very interesting. And I was glad that you asked questions at the end. You might have — it would be incorrect, I think, in listening to what he said and conclude that he just says diversify because he’s obviously done something very different from that. These are the dates; the latest auction was February 14. So every security has an identical CUSIP, which identifies it. I’m sorry I made a — now the thing is, to convert that into — what is this other — there’s another interest rate up here called the investment rate. But, it showed additional information that you won’t find on Treasury Direct; it showed bid and ask for dealers. The formula is — I could write it this way: price equals one hundred minus this. You can see these — you can see the bid and ask in . It used to be a big, broad sheet and they made it smaller in 2005 and they started — they keep cutting out data. To become the biggest publishing monolith in the world, it takes maybe a hundred years, so his father in Australia started buying up newspapers. So NewsCorp, whose price doubled when  fell in half, eats up and  is gobbled up by the bigger company. But, Murdoch turned it around and it’s still around. The critical thing about a discount bond is it pays no interest. Now, these are different from bills, as I emphasized, because they pay interest. You get /2 in six months, /2 again in a year, /2 again in eighteen months, and that continues until the last date — the maturity date — when you get 100 + C/2.The price is just the present value of that stream, discounted at the interest rate. This is January of this year, before the Fed cut interest rates, and this is the term structure. In 2003, time was almost free out three months. One thing to do is to go back and ask, what really are the reasons for interest? I should say income today on this axis and on this, income next period. So for each person, there is a point representing my income today and my income next period. This point here then is the present value of your income; it’s (  +  ) / (1 + ). If I consume less than my income today, I’m saving and my consumption would be lower this year. Why the interest rate clears — it’s a mysterious phenomenon, because it’s a market phenomenon and each person only sees his or her own contribution to the market and not the whole market. You might have some people up here who are saving and other people down here who are dissaving and the production would be operating at the middle. I want to talk about a couple of other basic concepts in economics of interest rates. Then he died shortly thereafter, so I got to him just in time. What Hicks said — this is the coffee hour conversation at The London School of Economics — he said, it’s right now 1925 but if you want to invest or borrow in 1926 I can do it for you. That’s all I have to do and I have locked in the interest rate. Well, in ‘26, the — I’ve shorted the one-period bond and so I have to pay out one dollar, but that’s exactly what I wanted to do. It’s very clear and that is the Fed had just cut interest rates to 1% — it was unusual — it was much talked about."
288,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-11,"The stock market is the information center for the corporate sector. It represents individuals’ ownership in publicly-held corporations. Although corporations have a variety of stakeholders, the shareholders of a for-profit corporation are central since the company is ultimately responsible to them. Companies offer dividends, stock repurchases and stock dividends to give profits back to shareholders or to signal information. Companies can also take on debt to raise capital, creating leverage. The Modigliani-Miller theory of a company’s leverage in its simplest form implies the leverage ratio doesn’t matter, but including bankruptcy costs and tax effects give us a positive theory of the ratio.","I believe that we still have on, for Friday, Stephen Schwarzman. I think I might want to take it down before he comes. I’m going to turn — I’m going to reflect on this because he may not be pleased with the article. article talks about the price of his condo — or co-op — in New York, which set some record, and so they tell things like that. A group of people starts a business and they say, let’s divide up the proceeds. Let’s consider a business as sort of a person who is owned, like a slave, who is owned by other people. When you create a corporation you write up a contract, which specifies the rules of the corporation; it’s like a constitution for the corporation. It’s mine if I own one thousand shares and there are one thousand outstanding. That’s a very important lesson to keep in mind. The typical example of dilution is: the board of directors has hired a CEO for the company and they want to motivate the CEO. If the company pays out money, the value of the company should have just gone down by the amount they paid out, but the number of shares hasn’t changed. That means that the price of each share should decline by the amount they paid out divided by the number of shares. The “ex-dividend date” is not the date that you actually received the dividend, but it’s called the ex-dividend date, which the company decides on that date anyone who was a stockholder of record gets the dividend and the guy after that, you don’t get that dividend. How excited should you be to get the letter saying your company has paid you a stock dividend? All that matters is the ratio: how many shares I own divided by the number of shares outstanding. The price of a share is going to fall on that day. When you pay out stock dividends you would think that now there are more shares, everyone divides by the larger number of shares, and the value of the company goes down; it’s not going to work to pay a stock dividend. Now, they are hoping that the price doesn’t fall because they’re announcing it with news and, in a sense, issuing the stock dividend is just a way to make it dramatic. Well, the concept here is that it’s a good business model. So that’s why we do it and there’s no shame in pursuing profits and getting it out to your shareholders. Some people don’t even know what a dividend is, they just think of stock as something whose price goes up. You can see that I’m saying about fifteen — fifteen times earnings is typical, but we’re in a high price-to-earnings scenario now. Again, this is price divided by ten-year earnings, not one-year earnings. Stocks were kind of different in those days. But real things matter, like if the company decides to build that new plant in Akron. We’re going to send a letter to all our shareholders and say, we have decided to pay a $5 dividend and so you’re about to approve this at the meeting. Well, if you think about it, it doesn’t make any difference to me. He said all this — this thing that I have up here — well the previous slide, showing the dividend earnings ratio — it’s just cultural; it means nothing because, to some extent, what’s not shown in that diagram was the stock repurchase. There is a possible correction to be made due to taxes. If there’s no tax advantage to one over the other it is completely neutral. I talked about a company as having only shares outstanding, but they also have debt outstanding. When a company becomes leveraged, it then becomes riskier. That sounds funny, but in a sense, that is — we have to define the sense in which it’s irrelevant. They call in Modigliani and Miller and ask, how much should we borrow? The basic insight about Modigliani and Miller debt irrelevance is that, in the absence of taxes or any other special thing, the real value of the company is going to be unaffected by whether they finance by debt or by equity because the real value of a company is determined by the cash flow that they generate by the business they’re doing. It is an insight that Modigliani and Miller are offering the corporations that I think they often don’t see that the real issue in the dividend — both the dividend and the debt policies — are really taxes and nothing else. If you ask them why it matters, they say, well it’s pretty obvious — it’s all their investor psychology that we have to deal with. The model that–I better get it right — the Lintner Model says that there’s a target payout ratio — that’s the Greek letter tau (τ) and that’s the target payout ratio."
289,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-12,"Real Estate is the biggest asset class and of great importance for both individuals and institutional investors. An array of economic and psychological factors impact real estate investment decisions and the public has changing ideas of real estate as a profitable investment. People’s demand to buy a home by taking on long-term debt, called a mortgage, is often tied with the overall health of the economy and financial markets. In recessions, home buying tends to fall and the opposite holds in a strong economy. Commercial real estate, held indirectly by the public through partnerships and real estate investment trusts (REITs), is vulnerable to similar speculative activity. The most recent real estate boom illustrates the speculative nature of real estate, and its relation to financial and economic crises.","I want to start out by talking about real estate as an asset class. You want, if you are setting up an organization to hold real estate, you want to do it, if you can, as a DPP because you don’t want to pay those taxes. Whenever possible, an ownership vehicle for commercial real estate will have the form of a DPP. The simplest kind of partnership would be if several of you got together and formed a business. The general partner takes on the liability; the limited partners don’t have liability. So typically, real estate is held in a limited partnership. Since it’s available only to accredited investors, you can’t be advertising because everyone would see it; that’s why the financing of a lot of this real estate is something of a mystery, because they can’t talk openly about it. They have many different kinds of REITs for different kinds of real estate. When you mortgage a property that means that you offer the property as collateral for a loan. Then if you fail to pay on the mortgage — pay off the debt — the lender can seize the property and sell it. They’re asking me to pay $5,000; I don’t have $5,000. It started offering, indirectly, but started offering mortgages to all these people who couldn’t refinance. This is especially relevant because — I don’t know if you saw — maybe you did — in  yesterday, Alan Blinder, who is a Former Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board under Greenspan and is now a Professor at Princeton, had an article saying, we need to bring back the HOLC now. The FHA went further than the HOLC; they demanded that mortgages be twenty years and also self-amortizing. Maybe it was more of a paternalistic role of government that came in then. We have to do it again because the mortgage institutions have deteriorated somewhat. It’s something like what we had in the ’30s, although they have other institutions that protect homebuyers, so they don’t see the turmoil that we saw in the 1930s. When you first bought the house they told you what the mortgage payment was and they’re fixing that forever, well for thirty years. When you get — when you sell the house, what do they do? The originator is the one makes the loan; the servicer is someone who manages the paying of the loan. But nobody believes the government when they say that because people say, surely the U.S. Government is not going to allow Fannie and Freddie to fail. This is very important suddenly, now with the housing crisis. A lot of people have the impression that home prices only go up and that they’re a wonderful investment. I constructed a series of home prices — that’s the red line and the red line is — you can see how it’s moved through history. It has suddenly shot up in the latest years; this is since the late 1990s. One of them was that the U.S. Government had shut down the construction industry during the war, so they didn’t build any houses for close to five years; obviously we had a shortage of housing. If interest rates are coming down, as you can see they are, that means the rate of discount is going down in the present value formula, so asset pricing should go up. If you look at Milwaukee, the employment figures don’t look that much different than Los Angeles. There wasn’t as much agreement on that, but one of the names suggested was Milwaukee; nothing has ever happened there in terms of real estate. So, Case and I did identical questionnaires in Los Angeles and Milwaukee and these are median price expectations. We saw it again in 2003, when people in Los Angeles expected 8% appreciation every year. People had great fear of being left out of the real estate market. The blue line is the traffic of homebuyers."
290,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-13,"Banks, which were first created in primitive form by goldsmiths hundreds of years ago, have evolved into central economic institutions that manage the allocation of resources, channel information about productive activities, and offer the public convenient investment vehicles. Although there are several types of banking institutions, including credit unions and Saving and Loan Associations, commercial banks are the largest and most important in the banking system. Banks are designed to address three significant problems in capital markets: adverse selection, moral hazard, and liquidity. Banks make money by borrowing long and lending short and use fractional reserves to lend more funds than are deposited. History has seen numerous problems in banks, including bank runs and insolvency. Government support and regulation, such as those implemented via the Basel Accord, as well as rating agencies help to ensure that investors trust the banks with which they have relations.","Before I begin, I want to say something about our speaker on Wednesday, Andrew Redleaf. I just want to say a little bit about Redleaf. There was an article by Eric Lee that showed that it’s not just announcement of news that does it; it’s also that companies must be backdating options because Lee showed that some of the price jumps that occur after the options are issued couldn’t possibly have been manipulated by the companies’ news announcements. He concluded this on the basis of a statistical test. So, he was going after himself, finding out all the companies that were backdating options, trying to beat the SEC and the regulatory authorities to the conclusion. He shorted the stocks or whatever to benefit. Redleaf was able to figure out who was going to get hit for the backdating scandal before other people did and then that was an advantage. Well after that, the bond price went up because people saw that as a sign that the company was tightening its belt and doing things right to have money to pay off the bondholders; so it was self-interested, I suppose — maybe you can ask him about this. It would happen to anyone who was a goldsmith because it’s just the logical extension of the business. That is, the goldsmith only had a fraction of the gold that was owed by the goldsmith. A lot of things that we do here have origins in Britain. It will help, rather than all trying to do it individually. In other words, the banks offer solutions to all three problems — adverse selection — and I’ll define these in a minute — moral hazard in lending and liquidity. Bankers play golf a lot because business people like to play golf and you have to keep your finger on the pulse of the community. You can’t call up the banker and say that, but if you’re playing golf it comes out perfectly naturally. Again, that is a problem that lenders have — that the company that’s borrowing the money has this unfortunate incentive, at least at certain times, to take excessive risks because the debtors will end up bearing the losses. Most of the people who want to borrow money from the banks — let’s talk about businesses — we’re accepting business loans — they don’t want to have to pay the money tomorrow. It becomes an arm-twisting thing — because of this risk of moral hazard, the bank has a threat to take the money back and they are going to find out quickly if you, as a company, are behaving wrong. The banker knows everybody in the community and when you’re playing golf with the banker, it may go beyond just collecting information; the banker might have positive suggestions. Now, banking has a — it’s important to know that banking is bigger in developing countries — I’ll say LDCs, less developed countries — than in developed countries. It still becomes very important to a lot of things. The first rating agency in the world was created by Mr. John Moody, in the U.S. in 1909. He had a neat idea and that was to give letter grades to securities that represented credit worthiness. Well, all the way down, I guess, to C or beyond that — then you’re failing. Well, they’re similar to banks and they have a relationship with the investment community and they try to stay on top of everything that’s happening. The history of financial innovation is always that the organizations adapt to crisis. It was an international convention that gave, what they called, risk-based capital requirements and recommended risk-based capital requirements to bank regulators around the world. No country had to follow these risks, but generally, countries have followed them because they want to be part of the international community and you want to use the standards that were recommended. Once they freed up interest rates, interest rates on deposits started soaring and banks started taking greater risks, particularly Savings and Loans. Once the rumor got started that Asia was in trouble, these people started withdrawing their money faster and faster and it caused failures of domestic banks in these countries. Now, part of the problem is that the rating agencies were rating their securities that they were investing in as AAA, in many cases."
291,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-14,"Andrew Redleaf, a Yale graduate and manager of Whitebox Advisors, a hedge fund, discusses his experience with financial markets. He addresses one of the fundamental questions in finance–whether or not markets are efficient–and concludes that although they don’t seem to be efficient, beating the market is very difficult. Mr. Redleaf discusses his thoughts about psychological barriers that make markets inefficient. He also comments on his beliefs regarding risk management and how people are compensated for mitigating risks, rather than for taking on risk as is often perceived. He ends by answering several questions from students.","I think — the, sort of, first thing that I think most people think about or the first question when you’re thinking about financial markets is whether they’re efficient or not — whether they incorporate all known information — if it’s possible to do, sort of, significantly better than the market as a whole. And whether they trade to a discount — whether the security in the closed end fund trades at a discount or a premium to the stuff they own — fluctuates meaningfully in a way that’s sort of difficult to recognize with the idea that the securities should be reflecting economic value. Lastly, there is a meaningful number of individuals and institutions whose, sort of, performance look — whose performance in portfolios is really inconsistent with the markets being efficient. In those areas, people are inclined to do sort of strange things. I think it’s useful to, sort of, know all the hard-wiring biases that people have to try and de-bias your thinking, but it’s not easy and in lots of cases it’s not actually people’s objectives. The first sort of principle to me is clipping coupons. The second is that risk is primarily about what is the worst thing that can happen. I actually believe in the history of the planet, there are very, very few instances of people getting paid for taking risk; they get paid for eliminating it. In fact, what he’s getting paid for is that he practiced a whole lot when he was a little kid on a wire that if he fell off of he wasn’t going to get hurt and that he’s really getting paid for eliminating the risk of falling off via practice as opposed to taking it. The big American banks are not functioning. In recent years, there have been more examples of things that are priced too high than things that are priced too low, but there are both and the market makes mistakes in both directions. Two, what do you think are the best ways an individual investor can make the best return in the market these days? That was pretty compelling as an asset class and worked really well. I just want to point out that contradicts one of our readings. We talk a lot in this class about trying to correlate to the equity premium. If the earnings go up, you’ll get paid twice because the multiple will go up too; that’s sort of the way things trade. That they can perform badly — they can be found to have breached their fiduciary duty, but they still get a lot, so I wouldn’t — I’m on the hedge fund side and against the sort of company management side. As it happens, so far that we’ve been involved, four companies have argued in court that failure to file financial statements is not an event of default. We’ve subsequently lost two and one is pending. If anything, other bondholders get to free ride on us but I think hedge funds–again, it’s sort of a good thing if documents and agreement have meaning and that requires active engaged parties; otherwise, the party that’s active and engaged will take advantage of the other."
292,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-15,"Mr. Carl Icahn, a prominent activist investor in corporate America, talks about his career and how he became interested in finance and involved in shareholder activism. He discusses his thoughts about today’s economy and American businesses and their inherent threats and opportunities. He believes that the biggest challenge facing corporate America is weak management and that today’s CEOs, with exceptions, might not be the most capable of leading global companies. He sees opportunities for current, intelligent college students to succeed in the corporate world if they work hard and can identify valuable business pursuits.","I am very pleased to introduce Carl Icahn as our lecturer. This company, Icahn and Company, has taken substantial shareholder positions in a number of major corporations, including: RJR Nabisco, TWA, Texaco, Phillips Petroleum, Time Warner, Motorola. And they have done this with enormous success. After that, I learned you have to learn something and I became an expert in options. That’s something else you could — you can still do it today, but it’s much tougher with all these computers. If you say — if a genius has an idea in corporate America — the genius has an idea; the next idea is, they give him an idea to resign. So, by definition, the assistant to the CEO is a little dumber than the CEO; now this guy now is the assistant. They give them whatever they want; they give them food; they give them clothing, but, you know, anything. They issued against this paper stuff called mortgage-backed security. They securitized them and these things are all floating around now. So, I do tell you that I think Wall Street is certainly a good area if you’re thinking about a career. I was really one of the first to come in and say to people across the country, rather than do it with your broker who doesn’t really understand this business, rather than sell it, sell it with me. So, we built it up and built it up and then I got one assistant; then I got another assistant and I kept moving up the ladder. If you can do all that, I think the chances are that you’re going to hit a lucky streak because luck comes and goes. If you have your health, luck comes and goes and realize when you’re doing really well that it’s not just you. It’s not simple to buy, generally, when everybody thinks you’re wrong. I think the answer is that most of them have to leave the company. I think that the problem we have today is — very simplistically — you don’t have true elections, so you can’t — it’s very hard to get rid of the CEO even though you theoretically have the vote; it’s very hard to use the vote. So, that kind of stuff is something to look at, but I’d be very careful in buying equities. But, I’m only saying that it has become one of the manifestations of our problem — the currency of the dollar has fallen. If you really believe that management’s not doing well, you can go and clean them up and put a good guy in, So, we — I know they criticize you like that, but that’s part of the propaganda machine; but it’s just not the facts. I can’t get into all these different things — stagnant boards, poison pills — and I think if you just change some of that we could be like, for instance, England is much better. But really, some of them become very apparent and when you look at them you can understand. I don’t think he could tell you; it’s just sort of instinct why you do it."
293,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-16,"Central Banks, originally created as bankers’ banks, implement monetary policy using their leverage over the supply of money and credit standards. Since the Bank of England was founded in 1694, through the gold standard which lasted until the 1930s, and into modern times, central banks have pursued monetary policy to stabilize the banking system. Central banks monitor currency flows and inflation, acting when crises, such as bank runs, emerged. More recently, central banks have taken an increasingly expansive role in stabilizing economic fluctuations. In the yet to be confirmed current recession, the Federal Reserve has used open market operations and innovative financial arrangements to try to forestall the recession and bail out failing financial institutions.","I want to talk today about monetary policy. Also, one of you asked, what literature do you read? This is the thing that worries central bankers. When interest rates hit zero, then they don’t have — it’s a little bit like your steering system on your car freezing up or hitting a — you’re hydroplaning on the highway; your steering wheel doesn’t work anymore. If you’ll allow me, I will talk first about just what is a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve, and what do they do. Then he’d write on a little note and hand it to the guy and say, just keep this note. They started out as a — they just minted the amount in one coin, which they thought was equivalent to twenty shillings. Then they implemented a rule that the guinea is worth twenty-one shillings. The issuing bank would be driven out of business if it didn’t — They all were using fractional reserve banking, so if you have a big player that’s demanding gold from you, you’re in trouble. All the banks complied and kept deposits with the Bank of England. They had a relationship, between the Bank of England. So, everyone would run to the bank and demand their money. What the Suffolk Bank did is it just, on its own, it just declared that it was the Bank of England for the State of Massachusetts and it required that all banks in the Boston area keep deposits with them. Cash box would be — would have something called — it was called,  . It wasn’t immediately renewed because the United States got into a war that we call The War of 1812. It was something like a central bank, but it was different essentially in that the National Banks really didn’t have authority to run monetary policy. That was an effort to disburse power away from the center. The United States dropped it in 1933 and other countries did it later. So, the gold standard ended in the 1930s and every country dropped it. Generally, it has been inflationary after 1933; central banks have generally, gradually allowed prices to rise. The Bank of Japan was established in imitation of the Bank of England in 1882. One thing that’s been a trend around the world is that the — I mentioned that the U.S. Federal Reserve System was different from other central banks in that it was designed to have independence. The Federal Reserve Board in Washington organizes policy for all twelve banks and the members of the Federal Reserve Board have fourteen-year terms. There was an important change in the discount rate in January of 2003. Actually, there are two discount rates; there’s primary and secondary. Right now, the Fed is in a difficult situation. All of these central banks — of Canada, England, Europe, and Switzerland — got together with the Federal Reserve and said — obviously they were worried about the financial crisis that was engulfing the world. So, you have some asset that nobody trusts, the U.S. Federal Reserve will take it on. There have been fundamental changes through time that make the role of the central bank evolve and change through time. Anyway, this recession has been a model for what happens in recessions. Then we saw the 2001 recession; that recession again is different. So I — by that indicator, we are in a recession and we don’t know that it’s over yet; it’s been falling. We don’t have data on individual city basis, but it really looks like the housing collapse — price collapse — that we’re going through now is on a magnitude not paralleled since The Great Depression of the 1930s."
294,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-17,"First, Professor Shiller discusses today’s changing financial system and recent market stabilization reform introduced by U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. The financial system is inherently unstable and would benefit from more surveillance, particularly for consumer protection issues, given the recent subprime mortgage crisis. Although this particular reform might not be successful, more regulators and policymakers are talking about changing the stabilization system and will likely alter the role of the Fed in the future.Second, Professor Shiller introduces the mechanics and role of investment banking. Investment banks underwrite securities and arrange for the issue of stocks and bonds by corporations. Corporations work with investment banks to navigate the Securities and Exchange Commission requirements for issuing securities. The banks then take on a “bought deal” or “best efforts deal” and help the corporation to find a market for the securities. Investment banking depends on the reputation of its bankers and, as we have seen recently, can be destroyed by rumors about the bank’s insolvency.","I wanted to talk today about investment banking, which is a subject of some interest around here. However, the news is calling it dead on arrival; it’s unlikely that the Paulson proposal will be implemented partly because it’s being proposed by a Republican administration — well, not just Republican, just an administration that’s coming to an end and we’re having an election. The interesting thing is that the next President of the United States will likely have a mandate for big changes. I find this interesting because it calls to mind some of the problems we had with the subprime crisis. The OTS is the Office of Thrift Supervision; it regulates savings banks. So, we put the two together — that sounds sensible, I guess. For example, when they started trading stock index futures, both these agencies thought it was in their turf because it involved both stock indexes and futures. You want us to go out and protect consumers, well of course that’s a nice mission, but that’s not our mandate. Well, the Fed is like that now, but what Paulson and Nason wanted to do is make it more than a banker’s bank. In my opinion, this is the trend anyway and I think we’re going that way. I turned them down, but they wanted to put me on opposite the CEO of Coldwell Banker, who is claiming that the crisis is just about to end. He was spectacularly wrong, but I notice he’s also no longer CEO; so, these things happen. I don’t know that Paulson’s proposal — I kind of like them, but I think that they’re not enough; that’s why I’m writing a book about this. I’ve talked to some of our students who have taken jobs at investment banks and sometimes I think they’re probably too demanding. You have to form some kind of balance in your life and not let anyone demand a hundred hours a week of your time. That is, arranging for the issuance by corporations of stocks and bonds. Then, later on, whenever you want, you can take your money out. So, they said, after this Act every bank has to choose one or the other. That is the important history of Glass-Steagall. So, if they borrowed 80% of the money, the securities only have to lose 20% of the value for you to be wiped out; so that shouldn’t be high-grade if it’s so leveraged. It might lead to contagion to other financial institutions. The same thing applies to underwriting because — but they do it in a different way. Instead of certifying — instead of creating deposits at a bank, they underwrite securities and they are not taking the money; they’re just an intermediary between you the public and the issuer of the security, but it’s much the same thing. So, if Ford Motor Company — it’s been around since when? Then they would probably contact a number of investment banks and try to make a deal. Of course, the investment bank doesn’t want to hold these shares, but the investment bank knows the public well enough to know which shares it can sell. The underwriting process is — takes the form of — it’s actually very much regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. I don’t know if I should tell you these stories, but I like to know why they call it a red herring. Now, one thing about IPOs is that they are very hard — to get a new security for a new company going — because nobody knows this company. This sounds strange — why would it work this way? It’s a little bit like trying to get tickets to some rare concert. People start trading the tickets afterwards or someone’s out there asking more money than it says on the ticket."
295,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-18,"Most people are not very good at dealing in financial markets. Professional money managers, such as financial advisors and financial planners, assist individuals in matters of personal finance. FINRA and the SEC monitor the activities of these managers in order to protect individual investors. Mutual funds, exchange traded funds also exist to assist individual investments, and pension funds provide further services. These investment institutions help people to put money in diversified portfolios and, in some cases, reap some tax benefits for funding their retirement income.","The fundamental point that I want to make today is that while economic theory describes people as managing their — maximizing their — own utility and subject to constraints, most people have a lot of trouble doing that, particularly as regards to investing in financial markets. There was a 1940s book called, , which was a best-selling book. The first thing is financial advisor; again, most people don’t know about these markets and they need someone to give them advice, so people set themselves up as financial advisors. We have the Financial Planning Association — that’s their website, FPA.org — and they license — they provide their own designation. They’re pure financial advisors and they don’t make money from commissions; it’s only from the hourly fee. I was just in Mexico over the weekend and I had the opportunity to meet the President of Mexico, which was exciting, and I also heard him say that he thinks Mexico needs more development of financial culture. I wanted to show the balance sheet of households and non-profits and that’s table B100 of the Flow of Funds Account; this is for the United States, but I think it would be similar in other countries. It all adds up; they valued all of these businesses and they valued them up totally as worth 8 trillion dollars. It’s almost as big as corporate equities held directly. So, that’s about $192,000 per person in the United States. The average person owes on the mortgage almost half the value of their home. We live in a country where things are managed by professional investors. Mutual funds are for the general public and the reason they’re called mutual is that the fund is owned by the investors in it. At that time, there were a lot of investor funds that were not — relatively — unregulated and they were offering investments to people that were oversold, often. We publish our portfolio and most investment funds were secret. That was the concept, so the concept became very widely respected and the whole industry grew. That was created, I believe, in the 1940s. If it’s going down, they would say, we’re trying to take money out of the mutual fund. They’ve cleaned up this act, so I think that mutual funds are our most trusted way of investing in the stock market and most people won’t invest in individual stocks anymore; they just go through mutual funds. Exchange Traded Funds are different than a mutual fund in that they are traded on a stock exchange. Exchanged Traded Fund is epitomized by the — this is the S&P 500 — it’s a portfolio that is managed according to rules; it’s not judgmental. But in the meantime, you can buy or sell shares in the fund on the stock exchange. Conversely, the institutional investor can go to the AMEX and say, I want to go the other way. I’ve got 10,000 shares of these ETFs; I want the stocks back. So, the government is not investing much compared to these pension funds; pension funds are much bigger. They help us solve the essential problem that everyone goes through their life cycle — you’re young; you’re healthy for a while; you’re working. After the bankruptcy, they found out that they had underfunded the pension plan. Well, they were not — they were asleep at the switch. I’m talking about financial crises of years past. That led to ERISA 1974 — actually eleven years later. There are really two kinds of pension plans; there is defined benefit and defined contribution. Another thing that defined contribution plans began to do with the advent of 401(k) is they would allow you, as an employee or as the pensioner, to choose the general categories of investments."
296,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-19,"The exchanges in which stocks and other securities are traded serve an important function in finance. They bring together people interested in buying and selling securities in order to create a universal price. Brokers and dealers are also an important part of the system, their methods and standards are ultimately behind the success of the exchanges. Many information innovations have advanced the functioning of exchanges, going all the way back to the ticker machine, which was created to communicate the price of securities at a point in time to all interested parties. Electronic Communication Networks and automatic exchanges, more generally, have significantly impacted the exchange of securities and few exchanges still have physical trading floors.","What I want to talk about today is about places where stocks are exchanged — or bonds or other securities. It’s important to keep the concept, so one thing that’s used to describe is to start with the letters  — that sounds likes it’s British Overseas Airways Corporation, but that’s not what I mean. The real estate agent usually does not buy the house from you if you’re selling your house. You have to get out into the business world and start seeing how often they come up. One of them is called the first market and this is traditional and that is the New York Stock Exchange. That is that — limited liability means that you, as a stock market investor, can never be sued for the misdoings of the company you invested in. With the New York Securities Law of 1811, the New York Stock Exchange began to really prosper because then it became something that anybody in the world could come in and buy a share there and have no worries — except, you could only lose your money that you put in, nothing more. We invented filing cabinets in the 1890s; that’s comparatively recently — it’s kind of amazing. I’ll mention — there’s also a college here. How old do you think he was when he invented the ticker machine? Remember, paper was more expensive then and he didn’t need to get a lot, so he changed the shape of it. This is just, maybe, a curious history about communications. It’s been in place ever since; however, because it was mandated by Congress, the computer system was up to date and modern in the early ’70s or late ’70s, but it hasn’t kept up and it’s considered slow, as a sort of dinosaur, and people want to avoid trading in it. Computer technology has advanced so rapidly it starts to create opportunities for people to set up their own competing systems and who cares about the ITS, which is a dinosaur, which nobody likes. They ended up merging with exchanges; this is in the 1990s and early 2000s. The specialist is sometimes just standing there watching and it’s all happening. If for some reason the price is dropping rapidly and the specialist thinks something’s wrong, the specialist is supposed to come in and buy on his or her own account; that’s an obligation. For example, in 1987, when the stock market dropped precipitously, there were criticisms of the specialists for not buying to support the market. There was the buy/sell crowd and there was another part of the floor — I can’t find this in my notes — where stocks would be rented. The story was that J. Edgar Hoover, who was head of the F.B.I., thought that shorting stocks had caused the Crash and he didn’t like it. If J. Edgar Hoover didn’t like what you were doing back then, you were afraid and worried. If you give a market order to your broker, you’re saying you only have to give the broker one number, which is a number of shares. Another kind of order, however, is a limit order. If it was a sell limit order you would say, I want you to sell it if the price gets up to $40. Then there’s another kind of order called a stop-loss order. Actually, you can see things like this on the Web now too, but not through Island anymore. I wanted to just finish with just a little bit of a thought about what it means to be a dealer in this market. I’ve never been a dealer and I don’t know the emotional thing, but the problem with being a dealer of any kind — maybe it takes a certain moral stamina, mental stamina, to do this kind of thing — is that you’re trading everyday. That’s why I didn’t become a dealer, actually. So, you run the risk of being ruined at any time in your life. A broker has to maintain — create a strategy such that this  is sufficiently probable — that this ruin problem doesn’t become catastrophic. The people who are in this business are people who can tolerate this prospect of ruin."
297,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-1,"Professor Shiller provides a description of the course, Financial Markets, including administrative details and the topics to be discussed in each lecture. He briefly discusses the importance of studying finance and each key topic. Lecture topics will include: behavioral finance, financial technology, financial instruments, commercial banking, investment banking, financial markets and institutions, real estate, regulation, monetary policy, and democratization of finance.","This is Economics 252, Financial Markets, and I’m Bob Shiller. The teaching fellows are very international and that reflects my intention to make this a course that is also very international because finance is something about the whole world today, not just the United States. Usman Ali is from Pakistan, Lahore, and he graduated from the LUMS, Lahore University of Management Sciences. She graduated from Wuhan University and is a PhD candidate in Economics at Yale. Just about any human endeavor involves finance. It is true though that his course is more tuned into theoretical detail than mine. Can I get a show of hands, who is interested in organic chemistry? This textbook is very detailed and it may be — I’ve had some reaction by students — more than you wanted to know. This is the last book — That’s a phrase that was coined by Allen Greenspan in 1996 and it refers to the stock market boom of the 2000s — of the 1990s and the boom and the bust — well I think it’s related to the bust that came out later, after 2000. This is one of the biggest classes at Yale, but I think we’ve got it so it will be a good and satisfying experience for you. Maybe I’m biased because I’ve been very much involved in it. Finance, I believe, is a technology and that means it is a way of doing things. We have been seeing financial technology advance in recent years and this advancement of technology has brought us some problems. Some people want to go back, some people think there’s a lot of anger about the subprime prices and there’s some anger expressed against the financial community. Nonetheless, when I’ve spoken in less developed countries, I find that they’re really interested in finance. There is some contempt for finance, I believe, because it makes so much money for many people. Maybe they’re not–-Maybe they’re in publishing or some other field but they understand finance and a lot of them are directly in finance. He ended up being chased down the street by an angry mob. It looked like aristocracy coming back in the form of rich financial successes and we don’t like that. So I think the outcome should be philanthropy and those of you who are successful really ought to give it away. That being part of a university community is a good thing for investing and you can see some evidence in that. The following lecture — I want to come back to some basic themes that — the third lecture — about technology and it relates to another book that I wrote. A theme of that book was that — I’ve already said this to you, but it’s a very important point — financial technology is evolving and improving just the way engineering technology or biochemical technology is improving. I know I’ve done that in my life and so I think it gives a different perspective on finance. The mathematical theory of probability was unknown until that time and you can see that insurance suddenly made an appearance at that time. Then I will move to portfolio diversification and supporting financial institutions. It will be about the capital asset pricing model. They understand something about human nature and how human nature interacts with our institutions. Of course, stocks are shares in companies and they’re traded on stock exchanges and they’re interesting to analyze because there’s sort of an ambiguity about stocks that is not widely perceived by a lot of people. An investment bank is a different kind of bank. It fits in well with the theme of this course about technology because in understanding what’s happening with brokerages, our technology, the new information technology, is central. The futures contracts were invented in Japan in the 1600s at Osaka and they were developed for the rice market in Japan. Does that mean we’re going to live in a world with $100 oil? An option is a contract that says you can buy so many shares of a company. Well I think it stands for the general population."
298,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-20,"Stephen Schwarzman, Co-Founder of Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, speaks about his experience in the industry. He discusses his thoughts on global finance, particularly at such an interesting and challenging point in the history of financial institutions. Although the near future might be rough for the United States and economies around the globe, capital does tend to come back and regulators are busy figuring out how best to put safeguards on the system. He also offers career advice and mentions some of the surprises he came across upon entering the world of finance.","Well, I have the pleasure of introducing to you today Stephen Schwarzman, who has kindly agreed to lecture our class. Mr. Schwarzman graduated from Yale in 1969. DLJ basically was one of the first large institutional stock managers of pension fund assets and so forth and I was allowed to go and interview a company. He said, well you were asking him for inside information. You can do that in the private equity business, which was sort of our largest business, and you can do that in the real estate business because you’re allowed to get all that inside information, if you’re trying to buy a company with our rules and also the rules of other countries. You can figure out what the supply/demand is for real estate in a much easier way. It was like infinitesimal in the private equity side of the business. I actually still wonder why they don’t since we put most of our money in that and we keep making more and more and outperforming. It was up to 18% of their portfolio and that’s one of the reasons why Dave Swensen has done much better than regular money managers. So, you put up nothing and you paid nothing, so this led to a stampede of people who wanted this. The financial institutions were losing all this money without the defaults even happening or people knowing how bad it would be. They’re sufficiently scared about what’s going on and the Federal Reserve is saying, well everybody can come to me and I’ll lend you all money to keep you liquid, so this whole system doesn’t stop. The implications of financial markets, which may sound like just sort of a dry academic course — this will also effect the outcome of presidential elections among other things because you’ll see that from what the presidential candidates started talking about nine months ago, which was a lot of foreign policy, war in Iraq, which we’d be doing a better variety of those issues. This is a trying time for the system and the Federal Reserve is doing a really excellent job at sort of guaranteeing it. Now, a bad one shows you a little bit about the volatility and danger of the currency markets. We borrowed dollars to buy this company because in Argentina you couldn’t borrow money for a long time. The linkage, which is called a peg to the dollar, turned out to be a most unfortunate thing and the emerging markets — this is when you started with the Russian financial crisis and this crisis. It was a company in Germany, but it had only 10% of its activities in Germany. The good stories are really a lot of fun; we enjoy those and so do our investors. It’s always fun, particularly for me, to ask because that’s how you start the process of learning. Now, once you do that — I’m giving you a little career advice here — you do that for about two years or three years and then after that you can start being more creative and finance can be a really creative, interesting, problem-solving business, where it’s global — it’s fun. Let’s see, certainly in New Haven now; I was in Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Cambodia, Korea, Ireland and Germany. They normally don’t invest millions of dollars for the opportunity to get their salary. Usually, the person working in the business gets more. The last time this set of circumstances presented themselves was 2002, after the recession in 2001, which went into 2002. How do you feel about and how do you deal with failures in investments, like your Argentina investment? Because I feel so passionately about that, the people who work at our firm, all of whom I’ve been involved hiring, understand how I feel about failure and so we don’t have a lot of people around who like failing either. What we do when we fail is we spend enormous time thinking through, what did we do wrong; what should we have seen; are our processes good; did we misidentify a variable that got us or did we identify it and didn’t evaluate how bad that can be — we got that wrong."
299,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-21,"Futures markets were started in Osaka, Japan in the 1600s to create an authoritative and meaningful market price for agricultural products, using standardized contracts. Since then, futures markets have been copied around the world to allow the hedging various future risks, financial and other. In the United States, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade have been the most popular futures trading markets. Although futures markets are changing and becoming more electronic, they are still important risk management tools for farmers and present financial opportunities for all manner of hedgers and arbitrageurs.","I wanted first to just think back a little bit about the lecture we got from Steve Schwarzman on Friday. I’m not going to use this for a few minutes. — But, remember Carl Icahn, when he talked to us, said something about he always just had some — he was always just good at making money. One more thing I wanted to say about Schwarzman. Futures, since it has its origin in agriculture, is a Chicago thing rather than a New York thing. What they did was they created an exchange in Dojima and the exchange had a lot of modern features; it had a trading floor. Now, this is very important; if you go shopping around to different warehouses to try to buy rice, you’ll get some warehouse who says, well I’m charging a higher price but my rice is better then that other guy’s rice. What they did in Osaka is they made a standard form of rice for delivery in their contract. This is the coffee, sugar and cocoa exchange; surely I can get a cup of coffee here. That might not be the rice you want or the date you want and yet, somehow the market gets going and gets very big. You hear all kinds of prices of rice; there will be rumors here and there that someone will say, I saw rice sell for such and such — so many Yen or whatever it is. That’s what we now have; that’s what is in a futures —I wanted to tell you one other curious thing about the — well, two other things about the Osaka market. In the warehouse, you better trust the other side because suppose the other side doesn’t work. That’s another reason why futures prices are so much more meaningful than spot or forward prices because there’s no counter-party risk unless you worry about the exchange itself. Everyone’s talking about futures prices because everyone knows that is a very well-defined, central market, liquid price. If it didn’t hold, I could make money quickly without risk and that shouldn’t happen. Think of it this way, the interest rate in Japan is different from the interest rate in the U.S. Government bonds issued in Japan are perfectly safe. Another forward market is the market for different interest rates. Now, the purpose of this contract is to lock in an interest rate. So, you could say, three-month LIBOR is the interest rate, 90 days in the future —  would be 90 and so, what the contract specifies — it also specifies a contract amount, , and  is actually usually 360, but sometimes they’ll say 365. This is as it was laid out in 2001; that was seven years ago. So, this is the change from the previous day of the price. Because the delivery point is in Chicago and I’m a farmer in Iowa and I don’t know how to deliver it all the way to Chicago. I’d have to rent trucks and drive to Chicago with my corn; I’m not going to do that. So, I could be raising some of this beautiful Indian corn that — remember it turns all these different colors and people hang it on their doors at Halloween — that’s not suitable for delivery at the CBOT. This doesn’t shown open interest, but you understand what this is?Now, the real — the price that we talk about when we talk about commodities is the futures price, overwhelmingly. We live in a very plenteous time; this is very unusual by historical standards. These are the standards for delivery at the Chicago Board of Trade. I got this off their website and this current; this is today. But they’re allowing now delivery of either one. It depends on whether wheat is in storage or not. So, this is the break even for storing grain. For example, right at the harvest end when the harvest is coming in, the relation between futures and spot price can become very erratic. It sometimes happens when the grain is not in storage that the price of the future is below fair value. This spot premium is the profit that is offered to the warehouser. I’m looking at this basis and I think if I can keep my costs under $.03 a bushel, including interest, then I will make money because this basis is converging to zero at the end for sure — or the stock premium will go from minus 3 to 0 — so this is a normal month."
300,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-22,"Futures markets have expanded far beyond their initial application to farmer’s planting and harvest cycles. These markets now allow investors and traders to set prices for a broad spectrum of assets and for a whole term structure stretching into the distant future. Some of these markets are often priced according to simple fair-value formulae, others are not. Futures markets can be in backwardation, where the future price is lower than the present, spot price. They can also be in contango, where the price rises with maturity and is higher in the future than it is today. The S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index is a recent invention that has transferred the mechanics of futures markets to the prices of single-family homes in ten real estate markets, in an effort to create a national market for residential real estate.","First thing, I wanted just to — I forgot to show — I don’t know how exciting this is, but this is a ticker tape. You did not pay the price for the contract; you only paid margin, which might be 5% or less than the price. So, the result is that they have a place to get the money. You see how the exchange can’t lose and you can’t lose; this is a guaranteed thing. Hillary Clinton, when she invested in the futures market, she had incredibly good luck. It’s like placing a bet on the stock market. You get, in total, over the total interval, between the purchase date and the expiration of the contract, you get the stock index minus the initial futures price you paid, times $250; that’s the gamble. The fair value  of a futures contract is equal to the stock price plus the stock price times the interest rate, plus the storage cost. So,  is the dividend yield that you get on the stock. You see this — to get from stock price to fair value — you see this is the same formula that we had for wheat, except that you understand that storage costs for stocks are negative because they pay a dividend. So, at this point of time, the futures price is very close to the spot price, so fair value calculations are relatively unimportant. This used to be a longer entry, but this is what they have as of yesterday. The people who doubted that back in 1980 — who doubted that financial futures would ever take off — were really wrong. Remember the  again, as in the preceding lecture, is not the annual interest rate unless we’re talking about a contract that matures in one year. Well, that’s because some of the stocks in the S&P 500 Index don’t trade really minute-by-minute with the same speed that you’d think, so the S&P 500 is always catching up on itself — the actual index. They are trading — this is different — it’s a physical delivery oil futures market, no different from the agricultural futures. I wouldn’t try tasting it, but the refiners like it better generally. The settled price is the important price because that determines the changes in your margin account. You can see that as delivery dates go out the settled price goes down, so the oil market is currently in backwardation. That is actually in two places; it’s in New York and New Haven. You can look at different times in history; particularly of interest here I have Hurricane Katrina and I can’t — this is Hurricane Katrina. Right after the hurricane, in August of 2005, the hurricane destroyed some of our refining capability and some of our storage tanks because New Orleans is an oil center where tankers come and they go up the Mississippi River. This is the second oil crisis here and that was in 1979-80. I was just down in Mexico and the President Calderon is talking about privatizing the Mexican oil — or at least part of it — oil industry because they have been disappointing in their exploration. I think it’s these — this impact of — news like this is having a psychological effect on the market and it’s causing a huge, well, you might consider this a bubble in oil prices, but I’m not so sure that it’s a bubble. It reflects the expectations of future interest rates. It’s quite remarkable that there is not because real estate is a huge asset class. There were some indexes, but they were rather poor, we thought, and not very reliable. With homes, the typical home doesn’t trade every ten years, so we have a huge non-trading problem. It was disappointing; we couldn’t get anyone to do it. I think we had the most progress with the Chicago Board of Trade; they actually did some research with us. The basic conclusion — they made a lot of phone calls — that’s how they did research — asking people, are you worried about your home price falling and would you like to be able to hedge the risk in the futures market the way farmers do in the agricultural market? Remember, the purpose of futures markets is not gambling; it’s hedging; it’s protecting yourself. You have reduced risk of your business and this is done a lot. You can see what dramatic declines are being predicted in our futures market. There’s a bunch of cities where the prediction is for a 20-25% drop; the best city of all is Chicago, but even there they’re predicting a 7% drop. We only publish it every month, but you can see that it’s been smooth."
301,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-23,"Options introduce an essential nonlineary into portfolio management. They are contracts between buyers and writers, who agree on exercise prices and dates at which the buyer can buy or sell the underlying (such as a stock). Options are priced based on the price and volatility of the underlying asset as well as the duration of the option contract. The Black-Scholes options pricing model is one of the most famous equations in finance and offers a useful first approximation for prices for option contracts. Options exchanges and futures exchanges both are involved in creating a liquid and transparent market for options. Options are not just for stocks; they are also important for other asset classes, such as real estate.","It’s a contract that has an owner and the owner of the option contract has rights to find in the contract either to buy or sell some thing — let’s say a share of stock — at a specified price and specified date. There are two kinds; there’s a put and a call. There are American, so called, and European, so called. If you write a call option, then you — and say it’s American — then you are signing a contract — let’s say it’s on stock — to deliver one hundred shares to the other guy, the buyer, whenever that guy feels like it. You had some pretty angry investors who lost everything in the stock market, but it couldn’t have been the U.S. stock market, which wasn’t created yet. So, I’m speculating there must have been someone here in New Haven; probably Yale University lost in this crash — I don’t know. This is the first one actually; the first stock market crash. I’ll tell you why it relates to options, because people were writing options galore in 1720 on stocks. Unfortunately, our emotions can carry us away from the good purpose and gambling is not investing. So, if you buy an option that was written by a broker, as they were in 1720, what if the other guy doesn’t — he just skips town; he’s gone. Now, what they did was they organized a central marketplace for standardized options. I’ll come back to that but this is just — I’m just talking about intrinsic value. Well, it’s going to be $10, obviously, because if you exercise it today, you’re buying the stock for $20 and you can sell it today for 30 on the stock market; so, the difference is 10. This line goes off into infinity; I just stopped it there. When you combine stocks, you are making your portfolio respond linearly to the return of any one of the stocks in the portfolio, but this is non-linear because we have a break; that’s what options do, so it’s non-linear finance. Sometimes people will complain that their boyfriend or girlfriend cannot commit. We’ve been going out for three years; it’s time that we get married, but this person — the counterparty — cannot seem to decide. The price in the market should always be greater than the intrinsic value, until the exercise date — the last date for an American — even American or European, but let’s talk American. It has to be valuable because fifty-fifty chance the stock price is going to go up and so you have a good chance of making money on it. Any little jostle upward is going to put it in the money. There’s a big chance that this will become in the money, so it has real value; whereas, down here, the option doesn’t have much value because it would take a big price move to put it in the money. We’re going to exercise it in one — we have an exercise date of one period and also under the restrictive assumption — and this is for pedagogical purposes just to simplify option theory — that the stock price,  is the stock price today. In this case, I’m going to call  the current price of the call today. Now, this is before the exercise date, so the price of the call is going to be worth more than the intrinsic value. That might be less than intuitive to you. See, that was very simple arguing that got us there. This is one of the most famous formulas in all of finance. I’m just going to present their formula and then we’ll think more about options. This is one of the most famous equations in finance. Black-Scholes says you have to know how variable the stock price is to price an option and intuitively you can see it. So, where does it — maybe the 1929 crash is here somewhere. So, our real estate options are another example of derivative."
302,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-24,"Professor Shiller, in his final lecture, reviews some of the most important tools for individual risk management. Significant inequality in domestic and international communities has created a need for social insurance programs, such as those created in Germany in the late 1800s. The tax system, bankruptcy laws, and government insurance programs are used to manage risk of personal wealth. However, each of these inventions must take account of psychological factors, such as moral hazard, in order to be effective without eliminating incentives to participate in the workforce, or other negative side effects. With regard to careers, including those in finance, young people should frame decisions with morality and purpose in mind, and with a broad perspective of both.","This is, as I said, my last lecture for this course and I’m entitling this lecture, The Democratization of Finance. As time goes by, we have more and more spread of these concepts. In most countries of the world, inequality is getting worse. If you have life insurance, that solves that. Notably, we have had a failure to provide institutions to help people to diversify their own household portfolios. I wanted to talk first about social insurance, which is not normally covered in a finance course. I wanted to talk about the extremely important risk management programs that the government has instituted. Then I wanted to conclude this lecture with some thoughts about financial careers and about morality. Young people are thinking about careers and I think that, ultimately, I give you credit for wondering about the moral purpose of different careers. The first income tax — it was either the UK or Holland at the end of the eighteenth century. The original experiments were all only marginally successful, but the U.S. finally got an income tax in 1913 and at a very low level, but this is the U.S. It ultimately became very important. It means that anybody whose income falls below very low is — it’s kind of like an income insurance scheme run by the government. Shortly after the turn of the century, Lloyd George, who was Prime Minister of the UK, traveled to Germany and looked at their system and was very much impressed and thought — he said one thing he noticed about Germany, there are no beggars. It wasn’t until the Great Depression that the U.S. adopted  and we still haven’t adopted ; we still don’t have a national health insurance. I wanted to talk about some of the important successes that — the Social Security System in the U.S. is our copy of the German system. What it did is it created a system of contributions to — right now, when you get a job, you have to pay 6.2% — that’s on your pay stub. Life insurance is something that pays the survivors of a family member who dies. That, however, was abolished in 1996 because of moral hazard. It denied welfare to immigrants who are not citizens and it limited food stamps to unemployed, childless adults. So, the Welfare Reform Act — I don’t know if it was the right policy, but it was trying to eliminate a moral hazard problem. Just so you’ll know in advance, before you actually do this, Chapter 7 is the liquidation form and this is where you say, this is it; this is the fresh start story. It becomes a disorderly process and so they go to the court for protection. Some of you will be filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. In fact, I left my whole phone bill lapse; I don’t pay my phone bill. That happens, but see this is the reality of bankruptcy. Now that sounds kind of radical and strange, but I don’t see why we shouldn’t do that, especially if we can get markets for home prices and incomes so that the lenders can hedge the risk. The reason I write this down — actually, I don’t know what you would do, but when I was reading the book I was wondering, it’s kind of shock to put this down and think, I could save lives by just a check for $100. You say, well these poor people in these less developed countries — you really can’t help them anyway because it’ll all get lost or the population will increase and there will be more dying people. What he did was create a bank that made loans to poor people; they’re called micro-finance. What these people do is, it seems to me, is they develop a career with some ultimate objective and somewhere along the career it may seem that they’re doing something unimportant or selfish, but you have to judge it in the big context."
303,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-25,"Professor Summers, former U. S. Treasury Secretary and former President of Harvard University, in this the first of two lectures in honor of former Yale Professor and Council of Economic Advisors chairman Arthur Okun, offers thoughts on the role of monetary policy in economic fluctuations, past and present. In the “Okun period,” ending about when Okun died in 1980, the monetary authorities were very much involved in actually creating economic contractions. Inflation would repeatedly get out of control, the Fed would hit the brakes, and the economy would slow. But, that is not the story of the economic cycles of the last two decades. Recent economic cycles appear to be connected with factors endogenous to the financial system, such as bubbles or cycles of complacency among lending institutions. Summers argues that to understand the financial markets and the economy, we must consider models of multiple equilibria, such as bank run models, where a change in confidence may shift the economy drastically without any change in fundamentals.","I have the pleasure of introducing this Okun lecturer, Lawrence Summers. Thank you, Bob, very much for that overly generous introduction. As a professor at Harvard, the single worst thing you could do was to sign your name to something you had not written yourself. This doesn’t mean there’s no role for cyclical policy, but it has the very strong implication that what you gain in the booms you lose in the recessions. If one thought about — thinks about — a universe of experience, the three Eisenhower recessions that were formative for Art, although I believe the second of them coincided with my birth — the 1966-1967 economic downturn — more conspicuously the major downturns in ‘74-‘75, in the wake of the oil supply shock, and in 1980-‘82, the Volcker disinflation; these were most of the experience we had with the business cycle in a substantial sloth of economic history. It is interesting to contemplate that if one looks before or after what one might think of as the Okun period and tries to give a simple account of what was behind the business cycles that took place, one offers a rather different kind of story. The dominant influences were endogenous to the workings of the financial system. This view, I would suggest, is certainly confirmed by less detailed reflection on international experience. Because what I’ve suggested so far is that if one distinguishes the last generation from the preceding generation — in the preceding generation, financial crises were relatively rare; business cycles were caused by the Federal Reserve eliminating — Federal Reserve’s concern about inflation. For the last generation, business cycles have been associated with financial crisis and the Federal Reserve has not caused downturns through its concern with inflation. Now, discussions of financial crisis tend to have the character of accident investigations. It takes the deposits and it lends the money for projects. It is a Nash Equilibrium and everyone is better off. A solvent bank is subject to self-fulfilling prophecy. If one wants a simple theory of why if you go to any American town and you look for the most solidly built building, with the most impressive façade, it will be a building that was used as a bank, particularly if it was constructed before the era of deposit insurance. It is precisely this notion of multiple equilibrium that explains why banks, more than other institutions, are at such pains to project credibility and to project permanence. Now to be sure, the more rigorous and skeptical among you will have noticed that I slipped an important issue by in telling this story; I said quickly that there was no market for unfinished projects. There’s this troubled — there’s this bank; in normal times, I have a one dollar deposit. In particular, where so many in finance seemed to regard attacks on the efficient market hypothesis in rather the way they would regard attacks on their spouses or children, and called for not just a rational rejoinder, but some effort at the destruction of the assailant. That seemed the obvious and natural interpretation. Well, it was an easy way to distinguish those hypotheses. Basically, the bubble psychology takes hold as a social dynamic not necessarily related to any rational assessment of the future behavior of markets. A prominent macroeconomist, early in his career, developed on the basis of some macroeconomic model that he had an extremely strong view that the British pound was going to depreciate. But if you think about what that means, that is a decision to pursue a positive feedback trading strategy. If people decide, for example, that because we have deposit insurance they are not going to check on the expressions of the bank tellers at their bank everyday, that I would argue is an induced behavioral response from a public intervention, but it is one that magnifies the gain from deposit insurance rather than reducing the gain from deposit insurance."
304,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-26,"In the second of his two lectures in honor of Arthur Okun, Professor Summers points out that real interest rates have been very low in the current subprime crisis. This indicates that the shock to the economy was more a financial breakdown shock than a disinflation shock. But financial breakdown shocks are not necessarily very harmful to the economy, so long as financial intermediation capital is not destroyed. In a financial crisis like the present one, financial firms are likely to take the step of decreasing their leverage, often by contracting loans, which creates its own risks for the economy. Regulators should place pressure on financial institutions to raise their capital and should intervene in near foreclosure situations, but should not attempt to support housing prices.","This is the second of two lectures from Lawrence Summers. The correct answer to that question, I think, is that it’s pretty unambiguous that a disinflation recession is best thought of as the Federal Reserve tightening money, which represents some kind of leftward movement of the LM curve — that output declines and interest rates rise and that that’s the proximate shock that is bringing about the recession. The policy response and the dynamics of disinflation recessions are not profoundly complicated. In neither case, if I gave you the data on unemployment, GNP, consumption, any real variable and I didn’t give you the time scale and I said — What year did we have a 20% stock market crash? There are data points from Japan during the 1990s. It’s natural to ask, why is the response to financial crises so heterogeneous with some episodes in which they seem to have very little consequence and some episodes in which they seem to have so very much? A deteriorating financial economy leads to less lending; leads to a deteriorating real economy; leads to less capacity to pay back debt; leads to declining values of financial instruments; leads to further reductions in lending and the cycle continues. Now, here comes a wild card; what should happen to the leverage of intermediaries in the face of the events of the last nine months? I don’t think we have a sound basis for estimating how much prudent institutions will reduce their leverage. The leverage choices they may make will, of course, be very much influenced, in some cases, by the way in which the government applies capital rules. It is not unreasonable at all to suppose that this is a shock that is of substantial magnitude relative to the functioning of the financial system and to the extent that the economy is dependent on the ability to get credit to the functioning of the economy. How do policymakers seek to maintain aggregate demand? Probably, the right indicator for monetary policy is not the Fed Funds Rate, but is LIBOR, in which case there has been rather less easing of monetary policy than looking at the Fed Funds Rate would suggest; but, one cannot make that decision in a definitive way. The political process was unwilling to do that. I, myself, would assign a much greater than 50% probability to a major systemic-risk incident if the damage at Bear Stearns had not been contained. Unfortunately, by its nature, it is difficult to tell the vigor with which it is being pursued. As a consequence, the private incentive for capital raising, even with a capital rule operating as regulation, is substantially less than the social incentive. Second priority for policy coordination is with respect to the very large quantities of liquidity that are now managed by governments. In particular, the imperative of the rapid recapitalization of financial institutions stands out. But, I will just make five telegraphic observations. Third, the government should be paid for providing the safety net and the modalities that are necessary to do that — need to be much more carefully designed so that if everything works out splendidly in, for example, the Bear Stearns transaction, the government would be a beneficiary of the success since it surely will be a beneficiary — surely will bear the burden if everything else is lost. So, I would be surprised if the ideas contained in that report prove to be a dominant starting point for discussion. It is all very well to say in a general way that it is good to avoid duplication and to move away from competitive regulation without going to where the trade-off lies in different contexts. Based on your experience and analytical skills where do you come out on this issue? I think that the three things I would emphasize are: competitive regulation is probably a mistake if you believe in regulation. The question is, you don’t seem to have follow through to the end of the story, which is that if you think that the leverage is not being set by supply and demand properly — too much in good times and not enough in bad times — then I would have thought — maybe you’re saving this for the question period, so I’m giving you a chance to say it — then you would think that regulators ought to intervene to change the leverage. For example, should it directly lend against collateral. On the first question, which was about pro-cyclical leverage — as I tried to explain, I’m not sure the focus on leverage is right rather than the focus being on lending. But, I think the least of the concerns is that somehow we’d have a general shortage of capital for other purposes. So, there’s the concern that, when you speak of large needs for capital, that the incentive to be a partial solution may not be that great. I don’t think it’s inconceivable that the government will have to infuse capital into institutions on a significant scale in the course of this crisis; but, I don’t think we’re ready yet to start planning for Nordic style or Mexican style, or Japanese style socialization of the financial system, though I wouldn’t — I think that probability is very low."
305,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-2,"Statistics and mathematics underlie the theories of finance. Probability Theory and various distribution types are important to understanding finance. Risk management, for instance, depends on tools such as variance, standard deviation, correlation, and regression analysis. Financial analysis methods such as present values and valuing streams of payments are fundamental to understanding the time value of money and have been in practice for centuries.","Today I want to spend — The title of today’s lecture is: The Universal Principle of Risk Management, Pooling and the Hedging of Risk. It really is probability theory and the idea of spreading risk through risk pooling. So, this idea is an intellectual construct that appeared at a certain point in history and it has had an amazing number of applications and finance is one of these. In fact, Shakespeare used it, but what do you think it meant? He separated from her because of dire necessity. So, it was in the 1600s that probability theory started to get written down as a theory and many things then happened in that century that, I think, are precursors both to finance and insurance. You could buy a policy that protected you against your family not having the money to bury you if you died. In order to understand probability, you have to take things as coming from a random event and people don’t clearly have that in their mind from an intuitive standpoint. Let’s say the outcome of an experiment, like tossing a coin. If you toss a coin twice and the first experiment doesn’t influence the second, we say they’re independent and there’s no relation between the two. One of the first principles of probability theory is called the multiplication rule. I’m not going to spend a whole lot of time on this but it gives the probability of  successes in  trials or, in the case of insurance  if you’re insuring against an accident, then the probability that you’ll get  accidents and  trials. We can define it in a couple of different ways depending on whether we’re talking about sample mean or population mean. People also call that the mean or the average. That’s different when you have continuous values — you don’t have  because it’s always zero. You have  branches on the tree and you count the number of leaves and sum them up. One would be — I’m having a little trouble putting this into the Rituparna story, but you see the idea. The return on an investment is how much you made from the investment as a percent of the money invested. The worst you can ever do investing is lose all of your investment — lose 100%. Jeremy Siegel says that in finance we should be using geometric and not arithmetic averages. I want to put down on this axis the return on the stock market and on this axis I want to put the return on one company, let’s say Microsoft. That puts a point right there at five and five. I want to — another concept — I guess I’ve just been implicit in what I have — There’s a distribution called the normal distribution and that is — I’m sure you’ve heard of this, right? But I want to emphasize that there are also other bell-shaped curves. So you feel that you know pretty well how things behave; but then, all of a sudden, there’s something way out here. I want to move away from statistics and talk about present values, which is another concept in finance that is fundamental. This isn’t really statistics anymore, but it’s a concept that I want to include in this lecture. What you could do hundreds of years ago — and can still do it today — was go to a bank and present this bond or IOU and say, “What will you give me for it?” You may say, what audacity for the British Government to promise to pay anything forever. That would be where having more money makes you less happy. We have many billionaires in this country and I think that the only thing you have to do with it is philanthropy."
306,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-3,"Technology and innovation underlie finance. In order to manage risks successfully, particularly long-term, we must pool large amounts of risk among many, diverse people and overcome barriers such as moral hazard and erroneous framing. Inventions such as insurance contracts and social security, and information technology all the way from such simple things as paper, and the postal service to modern computers have helped to manage risks and to encourage financial systems to address issues pertaining to risk. The tax and welfare system is one of the most important risk management systems.","I thought I would just remember a couple of highlights from the first two lectures to consolidate what we said then. You get a very different view of things when you meet the people. I just don’t — people don’t like — people would rather hate — I don’t know why it’s something — it wouldn’t be a good movie theme, would it?Anyway, you have to overcome these — you have to think that if you go into the field you would probably — If you’re successful — you would probably end up as a philanthropist; but no movie will be made about your life and you may encounter hostility the whole way. But, the real technology is — the technology that works to eliminate risks is to spread them out, to pool them, to share them among many different people. In other words, you start saving and you own stocks and bonds, and real estate, and other things. Some of them are living very badly and others are living with great comfort. The problem with long-term risks, also, is that anything that we do to mitigate these risks creates moral hazard. That’s why we need invention and theory in finance to minimize that. The idea that I want to develop is that the history of finance is a history of discrete inventions. You may have to adapt it to a particular environment, but basically it is copying other ideas. What they argued in this paper was that, if we had perfect risk management, then there would be perfect correlation of consumption across countries because if we get rid of the idiosyncratic risks, then all that’s left is planet-wide risks. Anytime there’s a risk that hits one person or one country the financial markets would spread it out over everybody and it gets very small. I don’t know these things personally, but it’s my understanding that the whole structure is suffering some moral hazard problems and that they’re evolving and trying to improve the institutions. I think that what’s happening is these ideas — Everything is evolving, so I’m actually presenting here our modern finance as the outgrowth of socialism, but that’s not the usual way to present it. In fact, he actually emphasized a concept that was first stated by a French philosopher Louis Blanc in the mid-nineteenth century. Well, I suppose we’ve learned from the Marx experience, but we’re, I think — Just about every country of the world now recognizes that it’s a complicated thing to get risk management working well and we have to design things more carefully. We can’t just smash things and start all over, we have to design a system of risk management. Every advanced country in the world has a system that provides for this, including the United States, incidentally. I thought this would be a good lead in to the second theme of this lecture, which is framing. I guess they’re elected officials and their voters are not finance theorists and don’t think of this in these terms. It is very difficult, so we have a policy that pays them if one of them dies. We have to exclude certain causes, like suicide, in the case of life insurance. They had to develop statistics of loss; they had to know what the losses were. But a lot of the inventions that matter to us are extremely simple. Why didn’t you think of putting wheels under it? To argue with them, I point out an example, which is more familiar. It happened in the late 1990s, in the United States, that patent offices started to accept financial patents. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, in 1800, paper was handmade out of cloth — that’s the way they made it. That is, there would be a printed form on paper with spaces to fill in the numbers or other things. So, all those things developed in the nineteenth century. For most people it was prohibitively — we’re talking in today’s prices, roughly speaking. Most people wouldn’t ever mail a letter or get a letter — too expensive, not to count only the paper and everything was expensive. In the nineteenth century, they developed the Postal Service and it interacted with the railroad. There were eleven million workers in Germany at the time and other countries looked on this as, this is ridiculous, no government can actually manage the system like this. It was already the same technology they used for the mail. Well, it was based on what you contributed. You will see, deducted from your paycheck — and you already have seen this — it says FICA and then there’s a certain amount, a certain percentage of your paycheck, and the employer matches just like in Germany in 1889. So, that’s why I think finance will be an interesting field for those of you who choose to go into it."
307,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-4,"Portfolio diversification is the most fundamental concept of risk management. The allocation of financial resources in stocks, bonds, riskless, assets, oil and other assets determine the expected return and risk of a portfolio. Taking account of covariances and expected returns, investors can create a diversified portfolio that maximizes expected return for a given level of risk. An important mission of financial institutions is to provide portfolio-diversification services.","Today’s lecture is about portfolio diversification and about supporting financial institutions, notably mutual funds. What I’m going to talk about today applies not just to comfortable wealthy people, but it applies to everyone. I want now to carry that forward into something a little bit more focused on the portfolio problem. So, the optimal thing to do if you live in a world like this is to get  as large possible and you can reduce the standard deviation of the portfolio very much and there’s no cost in terms of expected return. The different stocks tend to move up and down together. We don’t have the ideal world that I just described, but to some extent we do, so we want to think about diversifying in this world. What I’m going to do now — let’s start out with the case where — now it’s going to get a little bit more complicated if we drop the independence assumption. I’m going to — let’s do the two-asset case. There’s  = 2, but not independent or not necessarily independent. This is different — I was assuming a minute ago that they’re all the same — it has standard — this is the expectation of the return of Asset 1 and  is the expectation of the return — I’m sorry, σ is the standard deviation of the return on Asset 1. I’ll leave that up for now but we’re moving to that. This point right here is, on the pink line, is a portfolio 100% bonds. So, you can see that those are the two raw portfolios. What I have up there on the diagram are calculations I made for the efficient portfolio frontier with three assets. I have stocks, bonds, and oil but I want also to add one more final asset, we’ll call it the riskless asset, which is the asset–long-term bonds are somewhat uncertain and variable because they’re long-term. That is the final aspect of the efficient portfolio calculations. There’s a very important principle that finally comes out here, it is that you always want to reduce the variance of your portfolio as much as you can. That means that you want to pick, ultimately, a point on this — this line is tangent to the efficient portfolio frontier with all the other assets in it. Tangent means that it has the same slope, it just touches the efficient portfolio frontier for risky assets at one point, and the slope of the efficient portfolio frontier, including the riskless asset, is a straight line that goes through the tangency point, here. A mutual fund is an investment vehicle that allows investors to hold a portfolio. Then everyone should be holding the tangency portfolio. The theory says everybody should be investing in these proportions and this theory then — it doesn’t leave any latitude for individual choice except that you can choose which mixture of the mutual fund and the riskless asset you want. That would be a portfolio where you borrowed at the riskless rate and you put more than 100% of your money into the tangency portfolio. I don’t find that my analysis is profound in the final answer, I just took some estimates using my data and, again, we could — if someone wanted to argue with us they could argue with my estimates of the expected returns of the standard deviations and the covariances, but not with this theory. If you accept my estimates and you accept the capital asset pricing model, that would have to be true. The second problem set is about this model. I was using only from 1983 to the present."
308,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-5,"Insurance provides significant risk management to a broad public, and is an essential tool for promoting human welfare. By pooling large numbers of independent or low-correlated risks, insurance providers can minimize overall risk. The risk management is tailored to individual circumstances and reflects centuries of insurance industry experience with real risks and with moral hazard and selection bias issues. Probability theory and statistical tools help to explain how insurance companies use risk pooling to minimize overall risk. Innovation and government regulation have played important roles in the formation and oversight of insurance institutions.","I wanted to talk today about insurance, which is another risk management device that’s traditionally separate from securities, which we talked about last time, but the underlying principles are the same. For Jeremy Siegel, in the latest edition of his book, the equity premium is 4% a year since 1802. Name another country that probably has it. The country that has the highest equity premium — and that’s for the whole twentieth century, they couldn’t go back to 1802 — the most successful country is Sweden and after that Australia. He’s really saying that this equity premium is enduring and we should believe it. Well, he’s a good friend of mine, but I think he may be overstating it a little bit; we have some disagreements. Politics have tremendous effects on the values in the stock market and that’s because of — even if the government doesn’t nationalize the stock market or confiscate assets, they tax them. The interesting thing is that through time, as political winds change, these taxes have changed and they’ve gone up to some very high levels in the past in the United States and other countries. When we were taking 90% of dividends that was 90% of the stock market being taken by the government; but that’s not all because we were also taxing the corporations. In the early post-war period, the corporate — now I’m going to talk — there’s a distinction between the rate that they charge and the actual amount that they take. Most people think it’s a smart thing to do. Insurers, just like mutual funds, are providing risk pooling for you. These are the problems of insurance that we have to deal with. It could be the one person doesn’t have the accident or does have the accident. So, the insurance company with one hundred policies would have still substantial risk. What is the probability distribution for / in that case? That’s a bell-shaped curve, but it’s centered exactly on .2. That’s when the insurance industry was really born. In order for a design to work well we have to have every component there. It has to have a contract design; that would be a document, which is a contract between the insured and the insurance company. We hear a lot about monoline insurance companies in the newspapers today. Actually, the most important things that they insure are automobiles. Again, I’m repeating a theme that is in my book,  that financial innovation and insurance innovation are successions of inventions and each invention propels the idea more forward. It turns out that if you make them forfeit their cash value on canceling, then they won’t cancel. Well, what she found was that life insurance salespeople were going to families and trying to sell them on life insurance by explaining the concept and they would say something like I did. I want to talk about government regulation of insurance because I said that was an important aspect of insurance. I can buy insurance for myself this year and I can stop and if I — there’s nothing gained — or next year I would just have to pay it again. “ So, most states would essentially adopt what the NAIC says, otherwise — they’re not going to figure it all — they can’t claim to beat — it would be rational to do that. I want to conclude with problems, which may sound kind of negative but this is — I don’t shrink from negativism. The failure of the assumptions in many different industries can create systemic effects. They deal with, principally, state and local governments who are issuing bonds to raise money for their activities, like New Haven, for example, or any other state or local government. The only other thing — then next period we’re going to talk — on Friday we’re meeting again and we’re meeting again about — this time it’s about efficient markets and I want to talk about the evidence for efficient markets and against it and that will lead you into your third problem set about efficient markets."
309,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-6,"Several theories in finance relate to stock price analysis and prediction. The efficient markets hypothesis states that stock prices for publicly-traded companies reflect all available information. Prices adjust to new information instantaneously, so it is impossible to “beat the market.” Furthermore, the random walk theory asserts that changes in stock prices arise only from unanticipated new information, and so it is impossible to predict the direction of stock prices. Using statistical tools, we can attempt to test the hypotheses and to predict future stock prices. These tests show that efficient markets theory is a half-truth: it is difficult but not impossible for some people to beat the market.","I want to talk today about the efficient markets hypothesis. There were some conflicts when this huge disaster came. Every area is different and they have their own individual characteristics. In other words, efficient market says that the market efficiently incorporates all information and the prices are like the best information about the value of something. Then it will fly back and it will beat any other method of message transmission. So, these analysts then would jump to action when they hear news like that. Maybe an hour later you have a committee meeting and the experts are arguing about what this really means and trying to assimilate other information and coordinate with it; but, after two hours it started to really settle down. That’s their definition of the efficient markets hypothesis. said is that the hypothesis has informed a lot of regulation. One of those seven ideas to them is efficient markets. They don’t call it a hypothesis, they just say “efficient markets,” which they define as the theory that — I’m quoting them, “Security prices accurately reflect available information and respond rapidly to new information as soon as it becomes available.” I think that when we refer to the efficient markets hypothesis, it’s the semi-strong form that we’re usually referring to because the strong form is a bit strong. Then you have to ask, well what does it mean to say that price incorporates all information? In other words, the First Federal Financial has a low expected growth rate of dividends in the future. So, I was interested in this particular story because  wrote an article about them and noted the low price-earnings ratio and said, what does this mean? So how would the efficient market theory explain prices of companies that do not pay dividends? This theory says that the value — if Warren Buffett — of course, he can’t even say this, but let’s somehow say the company could say, we will never pay a dividend. It would convert into a non-profit, like Yale University. It might just as well be that because it also says in my fine print, you will never get a dividend on this. First Financial anyway — this is an efficient markets story — First Financial had a low P/E, so people were wondering, is this a bargain? It’s something that appeared recently in the housing frenzy. The market was expecting the price-earnings ratio — they gave it a low P/E because they were worried about — they had information that there was something going badly in this company and indeed, they were right. That’s not really consistent with efficient markets because it makes it sound like — as a matter of fact, I could have — Reading the  article at the beginning of 2007, I could have called my broker and I could have told my broker, short–please, I want to short First Federal Financial. That’s what efficient markets is all about. So, it has to look like the market is driven by a drunk when, in fact, it’s very precise and responding optimally to new information. This is the random walk;  would be here — how far the person is from the lamppost. That’s history; that blue line there is history. Now incidentally, a nice thing about Excel is I can generate a new random walk for you on the spot by pressing F9 — if you know that key on Excel. It’s a little different than this, I just added a time trend; otherwise, it’s exactly the random walk formula that I used. It seems to be coming back faster, so that looks different. Then I think — I should have done that instead of .95; then it gets harder for you to see the difference. The -statistic is a measure of statistical significance and the -statistic should probably be over two for a statistical significance. What I thought you might do for the problem set is to try to think creatively about how to forecast the market. Let me say this: I’m not — I’m going to have to continue with my doubts about efficient markets in another lecture, but I think that the story has a good element of truth to it. It seems to be a lifecycle effect where young people think, I can surely predict the market and then they get beaten down."
310,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-7,"Behavioral Finance is a relatively recent revolution in finance that applies insights from all of the social sciences to finance. New decision-making models incorporate psychology and sociology, among other disciplines, to explain economic and financial phenomenon, such as erratic stock price variations. Psychological patterns such as overconfidence and perceived kinks in the value function seem to impact financial decision-making, but are not included in classical theories such as the Expected Utility Theory. Kahneman and Tversky’s Prospect Theory addresses such issues and sheds light on irrational deviations from traditional decision-making models.","Today’s lecture is about behavioral finance and this is a term that emerged into public consciousness around the mid-1990s; before that it was unknown. Mathematical finance is a beautiful structure and I admire what the people have done and I’ve worked in it myself, but it has its limits. It doesn’t mean behavioral psychology applied to finance. It means all of the other social sciences applied to finance. Well, actually it extended to 1932 and you can see other historic movements. This is a random walk with a trend that matches the uptrend of the stock price. There’s nothing as big here — press F9 again — you can keep pushing and pushing, maybe you’ll get one but you have — you get the idea that there’s something anomalous about that crash from the standpoint of this random walk theory. It could be dragged up or down if I made a different assumption about dividends at the end. That’s the present value and the blue line is the forecast of that thing. Now, that may be a loaded question; but, I think that you get the impression that there’s something possibly wrong here with efficient markets because the red line is just a smooth growth path like nothing happens to it and yet the stock market is going up and down all over the place. For example, let’s look at the Great Depression of the 1930s, at the very least I think this chart will reveal some misconceptions that some people have. What I’m coming around to think — maybe it’s my cynical view, I’ve always been a cynic. So, these are questions about over-confidence. The first one is about the Statue of Liberty. Remember, the Statue of Liberty was getting weak and they were worried that something might topple down, so they reinforced it and we’re counting that. By the way, I should have asked, you have to be honest with it. That’s the total number of students at Yale University in 2005, including Yale College and all the graduate schools. Well, this one really got you, that was like 5%. I wanted to talk about some authors that I admire who have written about this. Again, they looked at CEOs, chief executive officers of companies, and they found that companies in industries that fail tend to fire their CEOs. Some guy who’s in a business — business is succeeding — why is it succeeding? This goes back to an article that he wrote in 1963. Expected Utility Theory would say that that’s a two-for-one bet that Samuelson is offering and it’s small compared to my lifetime wealth. My utility is essentially linear over the relevant range, plus $200 or minus $100, so I don’t really concern myself about risk. Let me try and do this again — it’s curved downward a little bit, but it becomes much less — I don’t — I’m having trouble drawing this on the board well. But a theory economist — that kink has to stay at a certain wealth level. Suppose I offered you a 25% chance to win $3,000 or, alternatively, a 20% chance to win $4,000. This is like Samuelson’s lunch colleague again, but a little different. Kahneman and Tversky put it in this following way: it’s a little bit like we’re cavemen. The weighting function looks like this — I’m exaggerating a little bit so you can see but — and then it jumps up or it jumps down here; this is the idea. You maximize the summation of the probability of the  outcome times utility in the  outcome. There’s something called “mental compartments” that people — Expected Utility Theory says, your utility depends on your whole lifetime wealth, so you should be always thinking that everything that happens today is just part of a bigger story; I’m always thinking about my lifetime. But anyway, I had one student who thought, well maybe there are other fashion things that explain the market and she went back to microfilm newspapers and measured the width of men’s ties in fashion advertisements."
311,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-8,"Regulation of financial and securities markets is intended to protect investors while still enabling them to make personal investment decisions. Psychological phenomena, such as magical thinking, overconfidence, and representativeness heuristic can cause deviations from rational behavior and distort financial decision-making. However, regulation and regulatory bodies, such as the SEC, FDIC, and SIPC, most of which were created just after the Great Depression, are intended to help prevent the manipulation of investors’ psychological foibles and maintain trust in the markets so that a broad spectrum of investors will continue to participate.","Next Wednesday we’re having David Swensen lecture to us. I think they motivate a lot of what — I’m going to write a number of principles of behavioral finance down and just mention them briefly and then return to regulation. For example, people tend to believe that their team will win; this has been documented by psychologists. These are — human attention tends to be sporadic. Now, they perfectly well knew that the wheel of fortune was random. They would say, oh no I wasn’t influenced by that number. For example, in looking at a stock, if you ask people to predict a stock market price they think of some number that they saw before and they are overly influenced by that number. It seems to me that if you type this you’ll get a spell check error. But that is a terrible mistake because we should know that sculptresses are very rare; very few people have the job of a sculptress or sculptor, so it’s a mistake. B.F. Skinner never let his pigeons starve; they all made it out alright. There are two different ways of doing it. The problem is that the history of finance is the history of a lot of people being exploited and treated badly, so there are temptations from the market. People who know human psychology know that they can exploit human weaknesses. You know that buying gold coins from some newspaper ad is not a smart investment, but they know that there will be people out there. I think it was because people were overselling investments and saying, there’s no limit to this investment but the blue sky above. So the Blue Sky Laws were basically coming in the teens. In the 1920s, things changed because the telephone first became widely spread. Other countries — In Europe, after the 1929 crash, they had a different reaction to the scandals and problems of the ’20s and it wasn’t as favorable to markets as in the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission, from the beginning, had it as its mission to make financial markets work properly; that is a wonderful story. Well they — it’s a balancing — they have to balance — sometimes they don’t like the choice they made but the advantage to being public is that people trust you more. Now, if you are a private company, you are limited to where you can sell your investments. If you’re a hedge fund, you’re not for the public — you’re not approved for investing by the public. As a result, hedge funds have a very low profile. You would be exploiting insider information and you would be victimizing the outsiders. I want to give you an example of SRO behavior and this is just one news story. Mark Jacob was upset with — he had been an employee of Emulex and had access to inside information of the company. A lot of people in the financial community are annoyed by them because these regulations are costly to comply with and they take a lot of resources. It’s for small investors because currently the limit on the SEC is $100,000; that’s not a lot of money. I think that deposit insurance is very important but we didn’t have anything for corresponding accounts at brokerage services until 1970 This was motivated by a spectacular failure of a brokerage, Goodbody & Co., in 1970.I hope you know what I mean; a brokerage service is a place where stockbrokers work and a stockbroker is somebody that manages your buying and selling of shares. So if you want to buy stock you can call the stockbroker. There are two things: you can have a cash account with them — you put money into the cash account and you haven’t bought shares with it yet; it’s just sitting — it’s like in a bank. That means Goodbody & Company owns the shares and you just have a contractual relationship with Goodbody that, in principle, some of those shares are yours. The only thing that SIPC does is replace securities."
312,economics,econ-252-08,lecture-9,"David Swensen, Yale’s Chief Investment Officer and manager of the University’s endowment, discusses the tactics and tools that Yale and other endowments use to create long-term, positive investment returns. He emphasizes the importance of asset allocation and diversification and the limited effects of market timing and security selection. Also, the extraordinary returns of hedge funds, one of the more recent phenomena of portfolio management, should be looked at closely, with an eye for survivorship and back-fill biases.","Let me start out by putting what I think is a relatively controversial proposition on the table and that’s that this investment management business, when stripped down to its bare essentials, is really quite simple. Well, the book is assigned; you all know it. Bob mentioned in his introduction that I showed up at Yale in 1985, after having spent six years on Wall Street, and I was totally unencumbered by any portfolio management experience. What I’d like to do today is talk to you about how it is that we moved from this old model to what it is that today many institutions call the Yale model. The last man standing is asset allocation and that tends to drive both institutional returns and individual returns. I think one of the more interesting and even simpler concepts that comes out of his study is that more than 100% of returns are defined by asset allocation. If security selection is a zero-sum game, the amount by which the winner wins equals the amount by which the loser loses — winners and losers being defined by performance after a security selection that has been made — well, that sounds like a zero-sum game. But then, if you take into account that you create market impact when you trade, that you pay commissions when you trade and you frequently pay advisors substantial amounts of money — whether they’re mutual fund managers or institutional fund managers — there’s this leakage from the system that causes the active results for the community as a whole to be negative. I guess you’ve already looked at ; you’ve seen 200 years worth of data. Just by putting money into a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks you would have gotten 3,077 times your money. If you put a dollar into small stocks in June of 1932, by the end of 2006, you would have had 159,000 times your money. If you look at the ten best-performing Internet funds from 1997 to 2002, the time-weighted return is 1.5% per year positive, so the funds went way up and then they went way down. They bought after the funds had gone up and they sold after they had gone down. Now, that’s not a huge number but, obviously, when you’re hoping to beat the market by a point or two, losing by .3% per year because of your market timing inability is a bad thing. Compound that 13.4% over ten years and there’s just an enormous gap between those mutual fund numbers that are in the prospectus and in the advertisement — the time-weighted returns and the dollar-weighted returns that talk about the actual experience of the investment community. But what did endowments and foundations do? If they have an underperforming fund, sometimes they allow it to die a dignified death; although, that doesn’t happen very often. Then if you fast forward to 2005 and look at the average return that was posted for 2000, it was +1.2%. The opportunity’s greatest where assets are least efficiently priced. How are managers going to behave in an asset class where things are efficiently priced? If you look at the behavior of groups of active managers and the dispersion of returns, I think it gives you some idea of what the efficiency is with which assets in these individual assets classes are priced. Half of the returns are within a spread of a half-percent. Then as you move out to the equity markets where it’s harder to price things as efficiently — large-cap stocks — there are two-fold percentage points, first to third quartile. We’ve had no down years since 1987 — 1987 that was the crash in October that I talked about earlier. I thought the University positioned itself well to take advantage of this really not surprising collapse in housing prices. I mean, it all depends on your perspective. I think market timing, as I’ve defined it, has to do with short-term deviations from your long-term policy targets. It’s something that permeates the portfolio and, I think, provides really interesting investment opportunities because a lot of the foreign markets are less efficiently priced than those that you find in the U.S. And I think the fact that our foreign investments are generally denominated in currencies other than the dollar is also attractive — a good diversifying tool for the university."
313,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-10,"Real estate finance has been crucially important throughout its very long and complex history. Describing the history of mortgage financing, Professor Shiller highlights the historical development of well-institutionalized property rights for mortgage contracts. Subsequently, he focuses on modern financial institutions for commercial real estate, elaborating on Direct Participation Programs and Real Estate Investment Trusts as means for its financing. The distinction between short-term, balloon-payment mortgages before the Great Depression and long-term, amortizing mortgages thereafter shapes the discussion of residential real estate. His discussion of mortgage securitization and government support of mortgage markets centers around Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, from their inception in 1938 and 1970, respectively, to the U.S. government’s decision to put them into federal conservatorship in 2008. Finally, Professor Shiller covers collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and elaborates on moral hazard in the mortgage origination process.","I’m going to start by talking a little bit about the history of mortgage lending. That’s why we don’t see mortgage finance developing there. So even today, in many countries of the world, the laws are not developed well enough. We don’t have property rights established well enough. Now, it seems cruel to throw someone out of a house who doesn’t pay on their mortgage, but you have to think of the other side of it. If we don’t throw them out of the house, no one’s going to make a mortgage. You kind of have to do the same sort of contract that other people are doing in your country. So, the partnership is an investment that is offered only to accredited investors. So, why don’t we do all business as a DPP, as a partnership?The problem is that the government doesn’t want you to do that, and so they have rules about what can form a partnership. And then there’s an end date, and at the end date you sell the building to someone else, and then you close down the DPP.You don’t hear about these partnerships as much. But there are other partners, called limited partners, and they have to be passive investors, and they have limited liability. You are a partner; you are not a shareholder. And I believe it started here in the United States. The idea is that we will allow a trust to create investments for the general public, for small investors. So, they had to define it so that isn’t generally available. This is all, I think, in your textbook Fabozzi. The government created a distortion that encouraged too much investment in DPPs. It was a terrible crisis, and so, what was happening?I am pointing this out because it’s important in the history of real estate finance. And the loan would say, you pay interest every month until two years has ended, and then you’d repay the $5,000, OK? The bank says no dice; you’re not going to get renewed. It was happening to millions of Americans. So, the government came in with what’s called mortgage insurance. And at the same time, the government said, all mortgages that are insured by the FHA must be 15 years or longer. Let’s call the monthly payment x, it’s the monthly payment in dollars. And so it was too hard to do this calculation. But what this table shows, is the break down between amortization and interest. But you can, in the U.K., get long-term mortgages. But the government did create them by privatizing Fannie Mae and by creating Freddie Mac. So the government stated clearly, these are now private corporations. In 2008, the real estate market crashed and we had our first housing crisis that was similar to the Great Depression. Canada has something like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac called the Canada Housing and Mortgage Corporation. We have securities called Collateralized Mortgage Obligations. That is that there’s a risk that the mortgages will be paid off early in times when it’s adverse to the investor interests. And these CMOs were sold to investors all over the world. Some of the issuers themselves doubted that these mortgages were so safe. I have the homeowner fill out the papers. What does it mean to service the mortgage? And there’s lots of new laws that are trying to tighten up."
314,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-11,"Deviating from an absolute belief in the principle of rationality, Professor Shiller elaborates on human failings and foibles. Acknowledging impulses to exploit these weaknesses, he emphasizes the role of factors that keep these impulses in check, specifically the desire for praise-worthiness from Adam Smith’s . After a discourse on Personality Psychology, Professor Shiller starts a list of important topics in Behavioral Finance with Daniel Kahneman’s and Amos Tversky’s Prospect Theory. The value function and the probability weighting function, as two key components of this theory, help explain certain patterns in people’s everyday decision making, e.g. the existence of diamond ring insurance and airline flight insurance. An in-class experiment underscores the prevalence and importance of the concept of overconfidence. Further topics include Regret Theory, gambling behavior, cognitive dissonance, anchoring, the representativeness heuristic, and social contagion. Professor Shiller concludes the lecture with some perspectives on moral judgment in the business world, addressing shared values and integrity.","So, I wanted to talk today about Behavioral Finance or about Psychology and Finance. I’ve been involved with it for over 20 years. It’s not really emphasized in your textbook, Fabozzi and his co-authors talk about a lot of things in the financial world, but not about the underlying human behavior. But the real problem is that people are complex and our financial institutions, as I’ve emphasized, are designed for real people and their functioning depends on the behavior of real people. I’m going to talk about all kinds of human errors, but I wanted to start on an upbeat note that the business world generally doesn’t exploit people terribly, I believe, that very characteristically successful businesses in finance and elsewhere consider their long-term advantage and the reputation they have. And beyond that, I want to emphasize also that another aspect of human behavior is morality. I thought it was very interesting, the way he put it. You had nothing to do with it, but you find lots of people praising you. And so they have checklists, but just to give you a sense–oh, the Antisocial Personality Disorder is called psychopathy, or one kind of APD is psychopathy. I’m not anti-male, when I point out there are three times as many jerks among males as females. Oh, another thing I wanted to say is that people are manipulable. A very simple and obvious manipulation is, they’ll put a price on some item they’re selling, like $9.99, all right? But if you were in business, would you do that too? And there’s a weighting function, that’s the two parts, which shows how people infer or how they deal with probabilities. And then, we have on this axis value, which is something like utility. I’ll erase my zero, so it doesn’t get in the way. You had it in your pocket and you lost it on the way to this lecture, you would feel exaggeratedly bad about that. Insurance should be concentrated on the really big things, like life insurance. But it may not work to sell that kind of insurance. The errors that people make are described by the weighting function. So most of us, in our mind, just say, it’s zero and I’m done. And of course, most people don’t buy it, but they don’t have to sell it to everybody. And he found that even the Caltech students made these errors just horribly. Well, that’s a painful experience when you did something wrong. Anthropologists have reported that gambling occurs in every human society. Certain people who have a personality, which makes them particularly interested in gambling, find that a life in finance can give them the kind of stimulation. People who are depressed may go to a gambling casino as a way of getting themselves out of the depression. You could game me by just giving excessively wide confidence intervals, right? So, why is it that people are overconfident like this? But you can’t think of all the perspectives at once. I didn’t do a separate male/female count. I don’t think it is, but it is more common among males. But I remember thinking he was a genius as an undergrad. Now that I think back on it, he had a sort of real world common sense that amazed me. OK, let me go to another–how much time do I have–cognitive dissonance. Or I think they said a marketing experiment. So, when they show up at a financial advisor, the first thing that they should do, the financial advisor should tell them, get out of your Ford stock. Then, they spun the wheel, and it came up and it showed a random number. And that is, that people overemphasize certain patterns that they think are representative of what they’ve seen before. But actually, it’s pretty hard to find those; they’re kind of rare. This herd behavior creates big swings in the stock market and other things. Anyway, the other example I have, which is also recent, not quite as recent as that, is a book that came out last year by Anna Bernasek, who is actually a journalist, not an academic. And her point in that book is that, a sense of personal integrity has dominated what people do in the business world much more than we thought recently. And you don’t ever hear of anyone getting sick."
315,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-12,"After talking about human failures and foibles in the last lecture, in this lecture Professor Shiller discusses regulation to minimize the impact of human errors. He outlines five different levels of regulation: regulation on the firm level, on the level of trade groups, on the regional, the national, and the international level. Concerning the first level, he emphasizes the role of the board of directors as the regulators of a company, its duties of care and loyalty, and its responsibilities in the face of tunneling. On the level of trade groups, Professor Shiller presents the history of the New York Stock Exchange from the signing of the Buttonwood Agreement until today. The subsequent description of regional regulation centers on Blue Sky laws during the progressive era of the U.S. in the late 19 and early 20 century. On the national level of regulation, he covers the founding days of the Securities and Exchange Commission, its regulation of hedge funds, as well as its efforts against the trading of insider information and stock price manipulation. He complements his coverage of national regulation with the regulatory efforts in the aftermath of the financial crisis from 2007-2008, i.e. the creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council and of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by the Dodd-Frank Act from 2010, paired with the European efforts in the course of the European Supervisory Framework, also from 2010. With respect to the fifth and final level of regulation – international regulation – Professor Shiller talks about the Basel Committee on Banking Supervisionand the G-20.","Well, actually, regulation and human misbehavior. So, this is a continuation of my previous lecture, in a sense, which was about Behavioral Finance and about human foibles. So, when I say I’m hoping that this class prepares you for a job in finance, I’m including in that a job as a regulator. And if the rules allow something that is questionable, you may have to do that too. So, those are the five kinds of regulation. And they could be called a board of regulators. In the last lecture I was talking about how people are different. But we don’t want them running a company. So, you want to have regular meetings of these, where you talk about what the company’s doing. And it also has an effect on the standing of the company in the community, because they see the names on the board of directors, and they think, well, this company can’t be shady, right? But she’s president of PepsiCo, the big international corporation. And this is an example of interlocking directorships. So, a board of directors has a really important function, because–let’s move away from the nonprofit. So, I’m going to talk about maybe the most important kind of sleazy behavior in a company. And he would defend it, if anyone asked, by these people are worth every penny. So, why would you ever invest in a company? And that’s usually interpreted as loyalty to the shareholders. But I’d say that, let’s just start from the beginning, because there’s so much temptation to steal money, to tunnel money out of corporations, it probably remains true that your main duty of loyalty is to the actual shareholders. But I wanted to start with an example of a trade group, and that is the New York Stock Exchange, because it’s important in history. But there was no organization for the U.S. stock market. And it’s been described as an idealistic document about our duties and our ethics. This is the profit they get from the sale. It was just not explicit in the original Buttonwood Agreement. Until 1975, the New York Stock Exchange was still following something like that 1792 rule. Now, they could justify that because they’re closing out the scoundrels. Incidentally, 1975 is the beginning of the National Market System, which Congress created. So, the third thing I said about local regulation. So, Douglas fought kind of a battle against Wall Street, as detailed in his book. Louis Brandeis, there’s a famous quote in his book , and it is, quote, “Sunshine is the best disinfectant.” And he was particularly upset by the, kind of, ability that Wall Street had to fool people by using complex language that they couldn’t understand. So again, taking a job as SEC chairman, or commissioner on the SEC, is taking on a high-tension job, I think. A hedge fund is a fund for these wealthy investors, and the SEC has minimal regulation of them. And she said that they were going to do it in three days. The FDIC is the company that insures your bank account. I’ll talk about two examples in the U.S. And I’m going to talk about the European Union as if it were a nation. I wanted to move to in Europe, because Europe has had similar legislation, also in 2010. But it’s supposed to worry about ”too big to fail,” and about systems. They can’t impose on anyone, but they can suggest things. And it has real impact, even though it doesn’t have the force of law. At this point, this is a good time in history, where there’s a lot of cooperation."
316,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-13,"Banks are among our most enduring of financial institutions. Their survival in so many different historical periods is testimony to their importance. Professor Shiller traces the origins of interest rates from Sumeria in 2000 BC, to ancient Greece and Rome, up to the Song Dynasty in China between the 10 and the 12 century. Subsequently, he looks at banking in Italy during the Renaissance and at the goldsmith bankers in 16 and 17century England. Banks have survived so long because they solve adverse selection and moral hazard problems. Additionally, he covers Douglas Diamond’s and Philip Dybvig’s model, which does not only analyze the banks’ role for liquidity provision, but also reveals the possibility of bank runs. This leads Professor Shiller to deposit insurance as a means to prevent bank runs. He discusses the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as well as the Federal Savings and Loans Insurance Corporation, together with the role that the latter played during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. The necessity to regulate banks in the presence of deposit insurance results in a discussion of the role of the Basel commission and an explicit calculation to illustrate the core principles of Basel III. At the end, Professor Shiller provides an overview of financial crises since the beginning of the 1990s, with the Mexican crisis of 1994-1995, and the Asian crisis of 1997.","So, today we’re going to talk about banks, banking. The firm, AIG, which was started by C.V. Starr, was converted into the biggest insurance company in the world by Hank Greenberg. Changes that will be with us for decades to come. And I’m not talking about central banks in this lecture. But banks, of course, precede that with other names. What is it that is the characteristic activity of banks? Hong Kong has three banks that issue their bank notes. It lends the money out long on 30-year, or so, loans. So, you would say, well, I need some produce from the land to compensate me for letting you use it. Oh also, the first–apparently, if I’ve got my history right, the first record of interest rates in China was Song Dynasty. If you were a prominent family, you would often take other people’s money for safekeeping. And wealthy donors in Italy gave money to set up this bank. And so, people would go to the goldsmith, and maybe they’re having jewelry made, but then they’d say, could you keep some of my gold in your vault? And then, the goldsmiths noticed, you know, they’ve got all this gold in their vault, they can lend it out. And they didn’t have to pay any interest on the notes, because people would hold them anyway just because they valued the safekeeping. And you have to–when you decide to create a bank–you have to decide which type you are. So, I said I would talk about the theory of banks. But what they described is a model–I’m not going to give you the model, just to tell you about it–the theoretical model of banks as providers of liquidity. So, it’s an important invention in the history of economics. One of them is an adverse selection problem that plagues securities. Most people who are investors are not good at estimating the value, the security of a company. I guess they believed Franklin Delano Roosevelt. So, the S&L crisis in the 1980’s was due to a widespread failure of saving and loan associations, and then, kind of a run on the saving and loan, but it wasn’t really a run, because the FSLIC was trusted. It’s about the Bank of England, which is their central bank, and what it does to maintain confidence. This is a German bank that German depositors put their money in. But again, the governments know that they want to maintain confidence, and so they do it. I just described a moral hazard problem for a company that borrows money from a bank, but there’s moral hazard problems for banks as well. Because once you’ve taken a risk from their shoulders, you create moral hazard for them. And so, what I wanted to talk about is the Basel bank regulations that were generated by international organization in Basel, Switzerland. We could have a whole semester on studying what these guys do. That means, that banks cannot take too many risks. And you have 100 in mortgages that you own directly. I multiply the mortgages by 50%, it gives me 50 million, and I’ve got to throw all these in. They have plus 2.5%, what they call a capital conservation buffer. So effectively, Basel III–this is Basel III, it’s not in your textbook, but it’s coming all over the world, 7%, OK?Now incidentally, the interesting thing about Basel III, they’re thinking creatively, they added another buffer, called a countercyclical buffer. But at the board meeting, someone might say, you know, 70 million sounds better than 14 million, I think we should do Fannie bonds, and tell all the guys with small businesses coming by, tough luck. So, we have created an incentive for banks to lend to those people rather than to businesses. And it led to a boom in Mexico, because lending was going wild, everything was happening really fast, and it led to a bubble and a boom in Mexico. The next example is the Asian crisis of 1997. And that is that banks fill a fundamental role in our economy."
317,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-14,"This is a guest lecture by Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, former Chief Executive Officer at American International Group. Mr. Greenberg starts his lecture with reflections on his time in the U.S. Army during World War II and the Korean War as well as on his first job in the insurance business as a junior underwriter. Subsequently, after meeting Cornelius Vander Starr, he restructures Starr’s failing company The American Home and creates the American International Group (AIG). Factors that have contributed to AIG’s success include global diversification through the opening of markets worldwide, the development of innovative insurance products, like political risk insurance and kidnap ransom insurance, and a unique corporate culture that manifests itself in Mr. Greenberg’s view of the senior management during his time as a band of brothers. Turning his attention to the early years of the 21 century, he addresses Eliot Spitzer’s role in his parting from AIG in 2005 and describes the developments at AIG that ultimately resulted in the government’s bailout of the company. He concludes with his personal assessment of the causes of the financial crisis from 2007-2008 and a critical perspective on the role of the government during this crisis. In the following questions-and-answers session, he talks, among other topics, about the insurance industry in China, and shares his views about AIG’s current CEO Robert Benmosche and the Dodd-Frank Act from 2010.","I’m very pleased that we have Hank Greenberg here today. And then, took over an insurance company, and made it into the most important insurance company in the world. And I think that you can tell us about your experiences, and what you’ve learned over so many years. So, I was able to fix a birth certificate, so it said I was 18. I’d gotten commissioned toward the end of the war. Came close to staying in the military, because I was fairly young and moved up pretty well in rank, and was offered–tried to incentivize me to stay in the military, but I didn’t. I came back from Korea, and the next day went down to visit some of my friends who I went to law school with, and it convinced me that I didn’t want to practice law. I just walked into his office and said, you have a–the word I used is not the word I use now–you don’t have a very good personnel director. And about a couple of years later–it’s a whole long story so I won’t take you through–I met Starr, C.V. Starr, who was the founder of the company that I chair today. And while it was an old company, it had a very poor agency organization. Kept its identity, because it was a very old company. More diversification in your business provides greater stability, and that became one of the things that was very important to us. And I visited China every year, a couple of times a year, to make that happen. It was a difficult thing, but we persisted. Anybody in our company that got involved in anything like that would be fired instantly. C.V. Starr & Co., we considered to be the ultimate company in the group. From 300 million to $200 billion, one of the largest companies in the world. But what we did, we had several principles. In 2000 and–I guess it was 2004, the end of 2004, we were reporting our earnings on a conference call with analysts, and one of the analysts asked me, what the regulatory environment was like today. Just before Thanksgiving, he dropped all those charges, because nobody reads the newspapers the night before Thanksgiving. They’d be reporting on everything that was happening on a real-time basis. Now, the money that AIG got, the $85 billion, at these terms, which is outrageous, they then had to pay the CDOs that you couldn’t tell what the real price was, because there was no price discovery. I’m running C.V. Starr & Co., Starr International. And clearly many people got mortgages in homes that couldn’t afford it. I could go through a list of them, but I don’t think the real story, on what truly occurred in our country, has been fully recognized yet. When I tell you it was a national asset, I know what I’m talking about, because we did many things that were beneficial to our country and our government. And they didn’t have agents selling life insurance. They had their employees selling life insurance. So, you can say that we created millions and millions of jobs in China. He has very little experience internationally, and his experience has been in the life insurance sector, not in the non-life sector. First, I would go back to where a credit default swap would only respond if the underlying instrument, that it is supposedly insuring, defaults. And so, what it led to was unnecessary chaos in the market. And I was wondering, do you think that the government should have any role, other than just keeping things fair? Do you think they should intervene, when these companies are having big issues, like what happened to AIG? Private sector jobs are the best jobs, in my judgment. And do you think that there needs to be a different sense of what risk is? It seems to me, they should have waited and heard what the investigators had come up with, before they passed a new law. You build a culture based upon your performance, what you stand for, what you believe in, and you surround yourself with people who share those beliefs."
318,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-15,"To begin the lecture, Professor Shiller elaborates on the difference between forwards and futures and on the role of futures markets to infer future prices for the underlying commodity or financial asset. Generalizing the discussion beyond futures markets to derivatives markets, he assesses the issue of speculation in those markets and its impact on capitalist activity. Subsequently, he introduces the notions of counterparty risk, standardization of contracts, and clearinghouses within the framework of the first futures market, the market for rice futures in Dojima, Japan. While describing wheat futures, he addresses the price patterns of contango and backwardation, margin accounts that help alleviating counterparty risk, as well as the fair value formula for futures prices. The third commodity futures market is the oil futures market, which leads to description of the history of the oil market in general from the 1870s, to the first and second oil crisis, until the oil price spike in 2008. Professor Shiller concludes this lecture with financial futures, specifically S&P 500 index futures, touching upon the difference between physical delivery and cash settlement.","Well, today I want to talk about what, to me, is a very interesting topic, and that is futures markets. But I think that, well, futures markets, what we’re really talking about is–There are different ways of viewing it. And that is related to what we’re talking about. Notably, in 2006, I was working with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is the biggest futures market in the world. And they’ve been trading now for five years. First, I want to put just a couple of definitions up. I guess I’m speaking in kind of abstract terms. And I think, it’s not true, because the financial community knows about this problem and ejects such people. And that would be a smart thing to do, if you have such a problem. Somehow, there’s just a failure for most people to understand it. That means holding it off, expecting higher prices later, right? And that warehouse is run by some professionals who do that. And the futures markets are just sophisticated markets that help that process. Problems developed in the forward market that led to the development of a futures market. And the Dojima hand signals were, I don’t know exactly, but something like this. If your hand was out, you put your hand out, that means sell. I don’t know the whole system, but that’s where it started. The problem with the forward market is that the contracts are all different. So, you don’t know what–these contracts, you don’t even know what the price of rice is. You know, there’s so many terms in the contract, so you don’t even know what the price of rice is. It turns out, funny thing, the futures market almost becomes the real market, because they’re all standardized. So, it sounds like there’s a profit opportunity here, right? It must be that there’s something that prevents you from just making a killing by buying rice, selling it on the futures market. It must be that at this point in time, storage costs are, in some sense, too high for this to be a real profit opportunity. So, this is what happens now in the real world. But they’re not doing a single thing to prevent the next famine. The people who are really effective are these quiet guys dealing in the markets. So, the broker debits my margin account by the daily, every day they change my margin account. So, if I’ve sold futures and the price goes up, they take it out of my margin account. I wanted to show you another futures contract. This is futures contracts and different maturities. Where the spot price, p–I’ll write it out, p, is the price today, OK?Now, this is kind of theoretical, because I just told you, nobody ever knows what the price today is anyway, because the only way you ever know prices is through futures markets. This is the price of wheat in each of these years. And it just seems like such a family story that we all should know about farming, right? And now, in recent years this is the front month oil contract. Before that, this is someone’s guess as to what the price of oil was, because there weren’t such well-developed markets. And the U.S. was the biggest producer of oil. And during this period, when you see oil prices were very stable, the oil prices were actually stabilized by the–it was produced mostly in Texas–Texas Railroad Commission. Because what happened was–it was actually coincided with the Yom Kippur War in Israel. But there was discontent in the less developed countries, who sold them the land and thought, why did we get gypped like that?And so, they started a process. So, oil used to be owned by the oil companies. It has something to do with the world financial crisis. And oil is, again, up above $100 a barrel right now."
319,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-16,"This is a guest lecture by Laura Cha, former vice chair of the China Securities Regulatory Commission and a member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong. In her introductory remarks, Ms. Cha emphasizes career opportunities in the private as well as the public sector of financial markets, and elaborates on her own career as a regulator in the Chinese market. In an ensuing discussion with Professor Shiller, she discusses motivations to work in the public sector, emphasizing the marketability of public sector skills in the private sector, but also a sense of mission to influence the creation and proper functioning of markets. Subsequently, in a conversation with the students of the class, she addresses the application and enforcement of regulation in China. Moreover, she outlines channels through which the Chinese government supports start-up companies, and addresses the recent mergers of various financial exchanges all over the world. Further topics of the conversation include the registration of Chinese companies on overseas exchanges, the plans for an international board at the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and a personal account of her studies at law school. Ms. Cha concludes her guest lecture by sharing her views about the Basel III rules.","Thank you for–thank you for staying up late to talk to us, I know it’s 9 pm now, in Hong Kong. Anyway, Laura–I’m looking at you there–why don’t you, you could introduce yourself, talk about what you do, and what your thoughts are about the financial situation are and then we will turn it over to questions. And all of these are the other part of the equation, which help to make the financial market function well. We want to make clear as regulators and policy setters, we want to make sure that the market not only functions properly, that the playing field is level, that the rules are clear, so that financial service, and finance, can indeed perform its function in society. I was headhunted to join the newly founded Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong. We didn’t know how important it would become later on. Some 20 years later, the Hong Kong market now is a totally international market. It really is what had happened in China that has propelled our change. And what I did in my almost four years as a Chinese regulator was to promote corporate governance. Particularly in financial services, everything happened in the U.S., and to a large extent it still does, but I think the world outside the U.S. has undergone a lot of changes. But I think, in today’s world, the globalized market means that the opportunities are everywhere, and I think particularly the emerging markets will offer a lot of opportunities. So, I think it could be a different phase in one’s career. When I’m thinking of what you helped achieve for China, I think it’s a really important mission in that you are getting the financial markets working right. And the things you talked about, like independent directors on Chinese companies, is a way of combating the problem of corruption–you didn’t use the word corruption, or maybe that’s too strong of a word. Another of our outside speakers in this course this semester was Hank Greenberg, who actually succeeded C.V. Starr as the founder of what was then the world’s biggest insurance company AIG. AIG was founded in–I think it was Beijing or Shanghai maybe, a long time ago. And that business being connected–we are getting more and more international, as you were saying. Some people say that the SEC in the United States could use much more resources. I think one aspect is that you have to have enough people to carry out enforcement. It has been now two years, since the Growth Enterprise Board has been set up in the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, what we call the ”gem board.” So, there are two specific boards addressing exactly the question you raised, namely to nurture the smaller companies. Whether it’s acquisition or merger or disposal, et cetera. And so, they may have different considerations than just purely the commercial side. The first part of your question, Chinese companies that are registered overseas and listed overseas. I think, the U.S. authority would take action against any fraud or misstatement. What type of law did you study, and how difficult did you find the transition from the legal world to the business world? I wanted to make it written better, clearer, et cetera. And that’s the other reason, why I think some of the young and bright students should not always be in the private sector."
320,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-17,"After introducing the core terms and main ideas of options in the beginning of the lecture, Professor Shiller emphasizes two purposes of options, a theoretical and a behavioral purpose. Subsequently, he provides a graphical representation for the value of a call and a put option, and, in this context, addresses the put-call parity for European options. Within the framework of the Binomial Asset Pricing model, he derives the value of a call-option from the no-arbitrage-principle, and, as a continuous-time analogue to this formula, he presents the Black-Scholes Option Pricing formula. He contrasts implied volatility, as represented by the VIX index of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which uses a different formula in the spirit of Black-Scholes, with the actual S&P Composite volatility from 1986 until 2010. Professor Shiller concludes the lecture with some thoughts about options on single-family homes that he launched with his colleagues of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 2006.","The subject of today’s lecture is options. It must have happened before we have any recorded records. I want to buy an option to buy this thing. And you get a lawyer and you write up a contract. When you exercise an option, that is, when you actually buy the thing, or in the case of a put, sell the thing, then you’re losing the choice. But in a sense, let’s think about this, stocks themselves are options in a sense, with a zero exercise price. So, you knock on the door at the farmhouse, and there’s a farmer with all these acres, and you say, I’m thinking of building a mega supermarket here. I have a newspaper clipping that I cut out. So, you take any of these rows, and it shows you, for various strike prices, what the options prices are. So, let me say one thing more before I get into that. I gave you an example before, when I talked about the farmer and you thinking of building a supermarket. And so, futures exchanges now routinely trade options on their futures contracts. So, the option creates a break in the stock–and this is why Ross emphasized that options price something very different, that’s not priced in the regular–no portfolio shows you this broken straight line relation. Well, if I put that portfolio together, I want to have plus one call minus one put, all right? That’s very simple, can you see that?This leads us to the put-call parity equation. It should hold approximately on this page. Do you see that?So, because of the put-call parity relation,  didn’t even need bother to put the put prices in, because you can get one from the other. So, the call price has to be above this line. For a call, this is out of the money, right? There’s only one more price we’re going to see. So, I’m going to write one call and buy H shares, OK. This is simple enough?Now, what I want to do is eliminate all risk. Now, the interesting thing about this theory is, I didn’t use the probability of up and the probability of down. But what it does do is, it shows the option price as a nice curvilinear relationship, just like the one I drew by hand. To use this formula, I have to know what the stock price is. And I have to know what the time to maturity–these are all specified by the stock price and the contract. That means that options prices were revealing something about the volatility of the stock market. The stock market fell over 22% in one day. The Standard and Poor 500 Stock Price Index technically starts in 1957, but I’ve got what they call the Standard and Poor Composite back to 1871.And so, these are the actual moving standard deviations of stock prices, all the way back to the beginnings of the stock market in the U.S. Well, not the very beginnings, but the earliest that we can get consistent data for, on a monthly basis. But somehow people got really rattled by the 1929 stock market crash. Also shown here is the first oil crisis, which we talked about, in 1974, when oil prices had been locked into a pattern because of the stabilization done by the Texas Railroad Commission. So, this leads me to think that option pricing theory–I presented a theory. But, I think, one always has to keep in the back of one’s mind, the risk of sudden major changes like we’ve seen here. President Obama proposed something called Home Price Protection Program, and it sounded like an option, a put option program. But, actually, it was a much more subtle program than that."
321,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-18,"To begin the lecture, Professor Shiller explores the origins of central banking, from the goldsmith bankers in the United Kingdom to the founding of the Bank of England in 1694, which was a private institution that created stability in the U.K. financial system by requiring other banks to have deposits in it. Turning his attention to the U.S., Professor Shiller outlines the evolution of its banking system from the Suffolk System, via the National Banking era, to the founding of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. After presenting approaches to central banking in the European Union and in Japan, he emphasizes the federal funds rate, targeted by the Federal Open Market Committee, as well as the recent change to pay interest on reserve balances at the Federal Reserve, enacted by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act from 2008, as important tools of U.S. monetary policy. After elaborating on reserve requirements, which are liability-based restrictions, and capital requirements, which are asset-based, he provides a simple, illustrative example that delivers an important intuition about the difficulties that banks have faced during the recent crisis from 2007-2008. This leads to Professor Shiller’s concluding remarks about regulatory approaches to the prevention of future banking crises.","We already had a lecture, a few lectures ago, about banks, so what are central banks? We fixed the bank note problem in 1863, but the problem was, there were still runs on banks, and there were still credit expansions and contractions, that led eventually to people in the United States thinking, we’ve got to eventually copy the Bank of England and do the same thing here. And I call it a copy of the Bank of England, but it might not be described that way by everyone. So, most of the money in your pocket is Boston money. Or even beyond that, the Federal Reserve could come to their rescue. I don’t remember exactly, but something like, we have put banking crises behind us forever, and this will lead to a system of prosperity and–I can’t think of all the nice words he used. So, central bankers start to become very important in modern society, because they are really the keepers of the gate of sensible lending. Because everyone was running to the bank, it was a catastrophic bank run. did a poll of its students asking them, how much money do you have in your pocket? And it got down to, like, $0.10 and $0.05. There are no more Deutsche Marks or Italian Lire. Some people think, that’s why the U.S. has had such a stable price level, because of our independent central bank. And they issue a statement every time they meet, and as it is now–actually, FOMC doesn’t go back to 1913–but I’m talking about the Federal Reserve as it is now. Negligible risk, usually, because banks trust each other, at least overnight, right? This is a policy decision of the Federal Open Market Committee. It can’t go below zero, because you can’t have negative interest rates–no one would lend at a negative interest rate. Basically, what the Fed has a new tool is, if that happens, to raise the interest on reserves, and that will help contract the economy instantly, very rapidly. So, in the world–history has always changed–the world, as of a few years ago, everyone emphasized reserve requirements, and those were the requirements that had as its motive preventing bank runs. So, something else has taken the center stage, and that is capital requirements, which we talked about last time .So, capital requirements are different from reserve requirements. And these were emphasized in Basel III, which we talked about before. But each country has to decide on the implementation of Basel III.The United States, in particular, is having problems with Basel III, because Basel III refers to credit ratings in many places. So, it led to the idea that we fully understand the risk of securities, and so, a complacency set in, and the government started to recognize these NRSROs as if they were proclaimers of God’s truth. Assume your regulators allowed you to start. Remember, every kind of asset has its risk. Well, cash has a zero risk, so it has a zero risk-weighting. The shareholders have no demand on you at all. They can’t come to the window and demand anything. The only deal you have with shareholders is, that all shareholders will receive an equal dividend, if the board of directors decides to vote dividends–they’re shareholders in the company. The shareholders can’t show up at the window, so there’s no risk of bank runs for them. So now, what are my risk-weighted assets? I’ve satisfied both my reserve requirements and I’ve satisfied my Basel III capital requirements. Loans to corporations to do business, all right?So, there we are. Well, it’s the shareholders that give, so we mark down common equity to zero. So, our bank regulator is going to shut us down, unless we do something to raise capital. Well, one thing we could do is, we could sell some of our corporate loans. Now, they might not want to do it, because the previous friends got wiped out. There were some–some people were impressed by the government of Spain having a better system, but the Spanish banking system collapsed anyway, so it didn’t solve the problem."
322,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-19,"Professor Shiller characterizes investment banking by contrasting it to consulting, commercial banking, and securities trading. Then, in order to see the essence of investment banking, he reviews some of the principles that John Whitehead, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs, has formulated. These principles are the basis for a discussion of the substantial power that investment bankers have, and their role in society. Government regulation of these powerful investment banks has been a thorny issue for many years, and especially so now since they played a significant role in world financial crisis of the 2000s.The second half of the lecture is a guest lecture by Jon Fougner, a former student in ECON 252 from a decade ago, who has since worked for Goldman Sachs and currently works for Facebook. Mr. Fougner discusses his experiences working at the junior level in investment banking and offers advice to current students about steps to take if they are considering investment banking as a career. Subsequently, he elaborates on his current role in the technology industry. In the concluding questions-and-answers session, he shares, among other topics, his views about a start-up initiative by Peter Thiel (a board member at Facebook) and compares the corporate cultures of Goldman Sachs and Facebook.","Today, we want to talk about investment banking, which is different from commercial banking. And it refers to a business of helping other businesses create securities. A company will come to an investment banker with a problem, and they want to raise money by issuing new shares, for example, to solve that problem. You can talk to a consultant, who will bring you no money, and another consultant, who has his hands on money somewhere. But let’s talk about what a pure investment bank does. So, you’re a private company, it’s just you and a few friends own the company, but now you want to go public, you would generally go to an investment bank, and talk to them about how to do it. There’s a bought deal, and then there’s a best efforts. With a bought deal, the investment bank buys your shares. So, those are the basic things that they do. And Ellis seems admiring of these principles. Uncompromising determination to achieve excellence.” They want to be known by a few prominent people. In fact, the most prestigious clients were often charged the most. So, a lot of people said, we have to go back. What it was, it almost the same as a deposit. So now, the reaction to that is, that we can’t let shadow banking go unregulated, and Dodd-Frank is part of that reaction. The latest news is, that the investment banking business is starting to look more stable and prosperous. Junior summer, I went to work for a large investment bank, as Professor Shiller mentioned, and I really enjoyed the work, knew that I wanted to go back to it. I went to see Charles Hill–now how many folks are familiar with Charles Hill? As the analyst, you really need to nail the details. And then, the information from those models, along with research you find by hook and by crook on the internet, from your colleagues, wherever you can, kind of comes together into presentations, polished pitch books to help win a piece of business. But this is actually an especially fun toy, because you pull this handle here, and then actually this one opens up. I can’t claim, I ever made it to the symphony, when I was an analyst, but a number of my colleagues were on the boards, involved philanthropically with those organizations. I think, there’s a lot of creativity in finance that, as Stephen Schwarzman mentioned in his talk, at the senior levels, when you’re dreaming how to combine companies, how to finance companies, how to deal with new regulation, as you mentioned. And then six months after that, as Professor Shiller mentioned, Bear Sterns sold in a fire sale to J.P. Morgan, and then six months after that, September 2008, we saw Merrill Lynch narrowly avert liquidation, become the asset management brand of Bank of America, which it still is today. And I just keep coming back time and again to , the bedrock of core investing principles that he articulates in that book. So, these are tools that I think have become a little bit more popular in recent years, which are basically psychological inventories where you spend an hour answering multiple choice questions, then they literally spit out a profile of how you like to work. And what my role is called is ”local inbound product marketing.” He didn’t want to build the faster horse, even if that’s what his clients might have asked for, he wanted to build something that was dramatically more useful, and for him that was a car, and for us it’s something that we call social advertising. And during the first week of training, one of the partners of the firm came in–and we use this term partner kind of as a term of art, because, as the professor mentioned, it’s no longer a partnership–but he came in and said, when our clients want to do really important things, they come to us. See, you’re kind of in an engineering company, right? And this sounds like a pretty straightforward thing, that you might learn by maybe second or third year of college, and yet you get out into the business world, and you’ll find that many of your colleagues, whether they’re coming from MBAs or other backgrounds, may not actually have that background. You know, I’m thinking, maybe I should change the name of this course to Financial Engineering. And if you think about, well, why are people advertising? So, we get to a narrower and narrower pool. These different media play different roles in getting people through this marketing funnel. Finally, I’m going to invite you back in another 10 years."
323,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-1,"Professor Shiller provides a description of the course, including its general theme, the relevant textbooks, as well as the interplay of his course with Professor Geanakoplos’s course “Economics 251 – Financial Theory.” Finance, in his view, is a pillar of civilized society, dealing with the allocation of resources through space and time in order to manage big and important risks. After talking about finance as an occupation, he emphasizes the moral imperative to use wealth for the purposes of philanthropy, in the spirit of Andrew Carnegie, but also of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. Subsequently, he introduces the guest speakers David Swensen, Yale University’s chief investment officer, Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at American International Group (AIG) and current CEO of C.V. Starr & Co. and of Starr International, and Laura Cha, former vice chair of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong and of the government of the People’s Republic of China, and director of the Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC). Finally, he concludes with a description of the topics to be discussed in each lecture.“Only known recording of Andrew Carnegie gives voice to history.” , October 30, 2007Andrew Carnegie reads from “Gospel of Wealth.” (audio) , October 30, 2007","This is Financial Markets, and I’m Robert Shiller. By putting “markets” in the title of the course, I’m trying to indicate that it’s down to earth, it’s about the real world, and, well, to me it connotes that this is about what we do with our lives. To me, this is a course that will have a philosophical underpinning, but at the same time will be very focused on details. This is the second time this course has been filmed for Open Yale. And I get emails from them, so I know that they’re out there. But I think I’ve gotten more philosophical and maybe more real world oriented as time has gone by. But I should say I don’t think that most of you will go into finance, because I think that most of you have other purposes. This should be a required course, actually, at Yale College, because finance is so fundamental to what we do and the structure of our lives that I don’t see how you can avoid doing finance if you want to do something big and important. I think that is the motive here for this university. Other people were reading novels and fun things. Some people call it we’re living in the era of financial capitalism. I wanted to compare finance jobs with jobs. Personal financial advisers, a quarter of a million, all right? I also put one oddball field on here: massage therapists, OK? The number of massage therapist jobs outnumbers any of those other fields by, what is it, 100:1. And so that’s the basic core that I wanted to get. And I can assure you that she knows finance, at least some basic finance. Steven Spielberg is on both lists, I think. You can do it and still nobody knows who you are or cares. You know, you still have 900 million leftover. So, you just build the biggest mansion and you do something really spectacular. So, one of the themes in the beginning of our reading list is–I think there’s a movement afoot today around the world of thinking about this problem, that you can get so big and powerful if you build a business and you use the financial techniques that are successful for other people, but it’s meaningless unless you give it away. So, later in the early 20th century he came out with a book entitled The Gospel of Wealth. But I have him here just for one lecture. It sounds funny, but it’s an interesting application of economic theory to very much the real world. Well, she tries to analyze what’s going on and she finds that sometimes it seems like clients are steered toward a fee schedule that’s really not in their interest and that the mutual fund managers are doing some things that maybe we don’t want them to do. And her dissertation also brings up another theme, which I thought I perhaps should have emphasized, that all is not well in the financial world. That’s another reason why I brought in Laura Cha, by the way. You can see this complexity if you read some of the documents that are associated with the modern corporation. And this technology is advancing, and it will advance a lot over the time of your career. But the problem is nobody really knows the future very well. And I think that insurance is actually a lifesaver. But, you know, charity doesn’t work on a big enough scale. This is about a theory that developed in the 1960s, that financial markets are wonderfully perfect. So, you want to give a share in the company to these other people as well in order to incentivize them. And so I think of the stock market as doing these functions. So, that will be, I think, an important lecture for this course. Notably, a new one just came out called Basel III from Basel, which is the city in Switzerland, and it was endorsed by the G-20 countries at their Korean meeting in Seoul. And we have that market functioning at a rather low level, but it is functioning and it seems to be growing lately. Lecture 19 is about public and nonprofit finance. And that means governments financing projects. So, for example, you take it for granted that our city here of New Haven has roads, it has schools, it has sewers, it has water. There’s an interesting book by Robert Frank, I don’t have it on the reading list, called Richistan, who talks about what wealthy people are like these days."
324,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-20,"Professor Shiller argues that institutional investors are fundamentally important to our economy and our society. Following his thoughts about societal changes in a modern and capitalist world, he turns his attention to the fiduciary duties of investment managers. He emphasizes the “prudent person rule,” and critically reflects on the limitations that these rules impose on investment managers. Elaborating on different forms of institutional money management, he covers mutual funds, contrasting the legislative environments in the U.S. and Europe, and trusts. In the treatment of the next form, pension funds, he starts out with the history of pension funds in the late 19 and the first half of the 20 century, and subsequently presents the legislative framework for pension funds before he outlines the differences of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Professor Shiller finishes the list of forms of institutional money management with endowments, focusing on investment mistakes in endowment management, as well as family offices and family foundations.","Well, we’re talking about institutional investors today. Corporate bonds held directly by households, 2 trillion. That would be institutional investors again. So, it seems like less than half, but close to half of all of the assets in this country are held by institutional investors. That would mean that the average family of four has about $800,000–I’m just multiplying it, 184 by 4. I’m telling you institutional investors are important, but as a fraction of the total national wealth, it’s not that important. And I think the family is still very important, as a manager of our wealth. People weren’t getting very good health care. But nonetheless, I think they’re getting more professional and more important. Somebody else, who is of a kind of a standard of ordinary type. And this has been a problem, because what it has done is, it has created a class of institutional investors, who live in fear of laws that could come down on them, if they, with the best of intentions, invest on behalf of their clients in a unconventional way, and therefore could be punished for violating the prudent person rule. And I did a search for prudent person–it appears nowhere. The same thing is true in other countries. So, in some sense, it’s shifted to the government. And the financial advisors are regulated by governments in most countries. And so, you effectively have to go through FINRA to get licensed to be a financial advisor. We have something else called mortgage brokers. These are people, who give advice on getting a home mortgage. There was no licensing of them until the financial crisis. Here’s the fundamental problem, that people are getting–they’re confronted by an increasingly complicated financial structure. And it was very open and direct with its investors. The classic example of a trust is, imagine that you have a child, who is handicapped in some way and unable to manage his or her own affairs. And if you look at the history of the world, the fate of elderly people is highly variable. If General Motors dies, doesn’t matter, because there’s a trust managing their pension fund. You maybe don’t remember them, because they went bankrupt in 1963. Though people are worried about it, it has managed to survive. So, an endowment manages a portfolio for some cause or some purpose, like a university. University of Bridgeport, not far from here, blew its whole endowment, and ended up having to join the Unification Church to survive. It’s like a job, coming to be a graduate student. But if you have $100 million in assets, 5% income is $5 million a year, right? And so, I can just put in the bank and not think about it? One problem is, the government will tax you on it. But you stopped answering the phone, because you’re annoyed by all these phone calls, and you’re thinking, I don’t want to just give it away to someone that called me up on the phone. So, that’s why 36,000 families have done this in the United States, and I think it’s growing, again, over all the world. This is one of the ironies that you face in living, that someone like Paul Allen, he’s a tough businessman, an aggressive guy, he sometimes does extravagant expenditures, but on the other side, there’s this charitable side, so I think we have to reserve judgment about most people."
325,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-21,"As the starting point for this lecture, Professor Shiller contrasts the view of economics as the theory of the allocation of scarce resources with the view of economics as the study of exchange. After a discussion of the difference between brokers and dealers, he outlines the history of securities exchanges from ancient Rome, to the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and Jonathan’s Coffee House in London, until the formation of the New York Stock Exchange. He complements this historic account with an overview of securities exchanges all over the world, covering India, China, Brazil, and Mexico. An example of a limit order book allows him to elaborate on the mechanics of trading at the National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation System (NASDAQ). Subsequently, he turns his attention to the growing importance of program trading and high frequency trading, but also discusses their impact on the stock market crash from October 19, 1987, as well as on the Flash Crash from May 6, 2010. When talking about fairness in financial markets, particularly with regard to the relation between private investors and brokers, he discusses the National Market System (NMS), the Intermarket Trading System (ITS), and consolidated quotation systems. He concludes this lecture with some reflections on the operations of dealers, addressing the role of inside information and the Gambler’s Ruin problem.","Well, today I wanted to talk about exchanges and clearinghouses, primarily stock exchanges. When he was elected president of the American Economic Association, he gave a talk about economics. Like flint to make stone tools, or ochre to make body paint. And they figured out where–you can do a chemical analysis and you can figure out where it was mined. It could have been, that they just killed someone, right. But anyway, some anthropologists argue that there was exchange. But only like a couple, and we couldn’t find any in the U.S. And we had searched around in many other countries, and there was just virtually none, no real estate dealers. But of course, there are real estate dealers, just very rare. Banyan trees are more impressive than buttonwood trees. China, because of the communist government, did not have a stock exchange until 1990. A lot of things were checked out by the exchange, and as a result, the way it would work in the 1970s, a startup company could never get traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The National Association of Securities Dealers, then, was an organization of these over-the-counter traders. A ticker tape machine is an electronic printer that would print out stock prices. So, if it’s a buy, I want to buy so many shares but I don’t want to pay more than such-and-such a price. And there’s another kind of order, called a stop order. Now, the other side–is that clear what we’re seeing here? So, now you’re sitting here looking at the screen now, and you notice that this ask price here, it’s higher than the bid price there. We could plot the amount at various prices. The way it works is you make a telephone call to your broker, your broker makes another telephone call to the representative on the floor of the New York Stock exchange, that person walks over to the crowd, and then discusses it, and indicates what–it’s like a poker game. By the way, the New York Stock Exchange–I was going to give you a history of this–the New York Stock Exchange has been slow to adapt to these technologies. I want to talk about some problems with high frequency trading, as things get so electronic. There had been a development of programs that were called portfolio insurance sell strategies. And these are automatic market halts that stop the market, when prices are falling, to help prevent another 1987-type stock market crash. So, that is the system that was started in the United States in 1975, and brokers still have an obligation to get the best price for their customers regardless of exchange. This is going to be with us now that we have microsecond trading. And let me put it in the context of an antique dealer. One thing, antique dealers don’t like is, when professional antique dealers come shopping in their store. You look through all their stuff and you find anything that’s mispriced. So, that’s the theory, that you have to make the bid-ask spread wide enough. I wanted to then just give you a little bit of math–I shouldn’t end a lecture on mathematics, but that’s what I’m doing here this time. So, I wanted to just think about that, and this is my last bit of mathematics. So, the theory of a dealer is that a dealer has to be thinking about being ripped off."
326,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-22,"As an introduction to public and nonprofit finance, Professor Shiller reflects on the remarkable financial structures that we have in support of public causes, making possible the achievement of higher goals that transcend individual satisfaction of needs. He gives examples of nonprofits, illustrating how that financial form can support a moral mission and social purpose. There is however sometimes a fine line between for-profit and public enterprises, because similar companies can be either for-profit or non-profit and because governments regulate and collect corporate profits taxes on for profit-organizations, implicitly creating a public purpose for them. Subsequently, he covers state and local finance, outlining the difference between operating budgets and capital budgets as well as the tax-exemption of municipal bonds. During the last part of the lecture, he provides an overview of historic improvement in governmental social insurance that ranges from progressive taxes to public services and to old age, survivors, and disability insurance. All of these advances in public and nonprofit finance have taken place in step with other advances in human society, notably advances in information technology.","For this, the penultimate lecture for ”Financial Markets,” I wanted to talk about nonprofit and government finance. The big problem–I’ll put it in the most broad terms–just about everything that we do that’s good is done as part of a team. But you see, that would be a mistake to think that, because, in fact, he had gotten a PhD in physics from the Zurich Polytechnic, which is a nonprofit organization. He could not have done it, if he didn’t read what other physicists were doing. But he couldn’t have written  by himself. Then, I’m going to talk about government finance of projects, and then finally, government social insurance. And let’s just think about why you would do that. A little nudge like that would help them save. Another thing, this sounds like a strange idea, but this is the kind of thing he can pursue on his own genius, as long as he can raise money to get them to do it. Now of course, you can’t get the government to pay for that. And the organization merely recruited young people, who had just graduated college, to go into teaching. Well, one of them is called Yale New Haven. Well, apparently the idea wasn’t from the Sisters of Charity, it was from physicians who were in New Haven. So, you could say that the U.S. government has nationalized close to half of the private sector. There’s almost no country that doesn’t have it. They own particularly the Fukushima power plant. The official name of the company was General Motors Corporation, OK? So, I gave the example of Charles Darwin and his professor, who advocated his voyage around the world. Little did he know, Darwin would end up an atheist after his voyage. It’s a big topic, but an awful lot of what gets done in this country is done by state and local governments. So, it’s building something that will last through the ages, and so it goes on the capital budget, and not on the operating budget. There’s only 30 people living in this town. And they go deeply into debt as a result of having created all of these capital investments, and having the debt against them. So, I said that there haven’t been many historically, but people are edgy now thinking that there could be some now because of the financial crisis. And progressive taxes have increasingly, in recent years, adopted something analogous to the earned income tax credit, the EITC–that’s the U.S. name for it, but it’s now in many countries around the world–that provides negative taxes for the lowest income people. So, it’s like an insurance program against possible failure in achieving status in the economic system. And I’m using U.S. terms, but these are terms that–these things happen in virtually all advanced countries. So, if you are permanently paralyzed, you get an income for life. But all these are risk management devices that are offered by governments. I think this has to do ultimately with technology. As a result, if you bought a newspaper in, say, 1790, it would be just one page, and it would be printed on the smallest print, because it was just so expensive. By the way, I found an old textbook from Yale University from 1837. And you never got a receipt for anything, when you bought something. Now, it may seem like a small thing, but it was a very important thing, because you could make accurate documents, and they were not subject to misinterpretation because of sloppy handwriting–and I’m doing sloppy handwriting here for you, but I’m using the old technology here."
327,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-23,"After reviewing the main themes of this course, Professor Shiller shares his views about finance from a broader perspective. His first topic, the morality of finance, centers on Peter Unger’s  and William Graham Sumner’s . Subsequently, he addresses the hopelessness about the world’s future that some see from Malthus’ dismal law from the , but contrasts it with a positive outlook on purposes and goals in life. While discussing the endurance and survival of financial contracts, he outlines the cases of Germany after World War I, Iran after the Islamic Revolution, and South Africa after the end of apartheid, in which financial contracts prevailed, but does not fail to mention the cases of Russia after the Russian Revolution and Japan after World War II, in which it has not been the case. After a brief comparison between Mathematical Finance and Behavioral Finance, he elaborates on the interplay between wealth and inequality, building on Jacob Hacker’s and Paul Pearson’s , Karl Marx’s , and Robert K. Merton concept of the cosmopolitan class. Following this, he emphasizes the democratization of finance as an important future trend and provides examples for this process from his books , and. Professor Shiller concludes the course with advice for finding the right career, highlighting the role of random events, but also the importance of a long-horizon outlook and an orientation towards history in the making.","This is the concluding lecture for ”Financial Markets.” and it gave you a lot of detailed information about financial markets and institutions. Maybe, I’m just too enthusiastic about it, but the way things get done in our society is through financial arrangements. But that’s where the meaning of life comes from. I won’t ask for–no one raised their hand. I think of this as at the juncture of philosophy and psychology. He has the distinction of being the first American professor to teach a course called Sociology, and in those days, there wasn’t the distinction between the social sciences that there is now. Anyone who believes that any great enterprise of an industrial character can be started without labor must have little experience of life. This is one of Unger’s–Unger talks about rationalizations we give for not being moral, and he calls it futility is a rationalization. So, the population growth follows an exponential growth curve. And so, the population will run off with all of our resources. No possible form of society could prevent the almost constant action of misery upon a great part of mankind if in a state of inequality and upon all if all were equal.” And that’s why I think there is–maybe I’m saying the obvious here, but I want to say it anyway–that there are plenty of purposes and goals that people can fulfill, even taking as given Malthus’ dismal law. I talked last period about nonprofit and charity, and government as well. This is what’s being threatened by population growth. Peter Unger, in his book, is talking always about, would you save a child who fell in the water or something like that? You come in, you are a totally different government, now you’re a radical Islamic government. On the contrary, he is a leader of industry, because he is a capitalist. But I’m going to come back to the democratization of finance, but it seems like capitalism–it isn’t essential to capitalism that some social class dominates capital. But I think, that anything he said is of limited relevance today–was always of limited relevance. And I think, that there are animosities and conflicts, but it’s a little bit harder, because the cosmopolitans are so scattered and they’re relatives of us, so it’s not as intense a social contrast. Inequality is substantially due to a failure to manage risks. I mean, some inequality is due to fundamental things, like someone is talented and can make more money. But it’s also due to random things that are not controlled. So, it’s not democratizing finance–we haven’t finished democratizing finance. Because the lobbyists that I told you about, representing credit card or the mortgage industry, are adamantly opposed seeing her put on as head of the bureau. It’s economic events that make you–you know, you’re 40 years old, you’ve trained for, let’s say, nuclear engineering, and then we have the Fukushima or the Sendai disasters, and then suddenly no government of the world wants to build nuclear plants anymore. So, what I proposed is, that we should think forward. But he had a scheme for getting people to pay back the loans. And these women can’t get that capital, but when he makes it available to them as a group, they then interact with each other and enforce the good behavior of each other. And we have such an advance in our technology, that there really ought to be big changes that will come. Things like that are going to happen in the next century. And so, I think you have to reflect on your role as an agent, not to think of it as something that a remote government is handling. I mentioned before, the 40 year-old, who finds that his career is suddenly eliminated because of some random change. I was going to point out studies that show how random events affect where you go. So, that’s a time-honored truth, that randomness–I actually had this “time and chance happeneth to them all,” I actually had that inscribed in Latin when I had my office redone."
328,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-2,"Professor Shiller introduces basic concepts from probability theory and embeds these concepts into the concrete context of financial crises, with examples from the financial crisis from 2007-2008. Subsequent to a historical narrative of the financial crisis from 2007-2008, he turns to the definition of the expected value and the variance of a random variable, as well as the covariance and the correlation of two random variables. The concept of independence leads to the law of large numbers, but financial crises show that the assumption of independence can be deceiving, in particular through its impact on the computation of Value at Risk measures. Additionally, he covers regression analysis for financial returns, which leads to the decomposition of a financial asset’s risk into idiosyncratic and systematic risk. Professor Shiller concludes by talking about the prominent assumption that random shocks to the financial economy are normally distributed. Historical stock market patterns, specifically during crises times, establish that outliers occur too frequently to be compatible with the normal distribution. Gorton, “Slapped in the Face by the Invisible Hand”","So, what I want to do this time is talk about probability. The crisis we got into was the accumulation of a lot of little events. And sometimes they accumulate according to the laws of probability into big events. Things like that which are core concepts in finance. So, you if you talk to someone before the year 1600, and say, this has a probability of 0.5, they would have no idea what you’re talking about. And it actually allows us to forecast the weather. And again, these are going to be re-covered in the review session that Elan Fuld, one of our teaching assistants, will do. And so, return at time t, if t is equal to 3, that would be the return at month three. In a limited liability economy that we live in, the law says that you cannot lose more than the money you put in, and that’s going to be our assumption. But I’m not going to explain or elaborate that. So, what I want to say is that this is the average, or the mean, or sample mean when you have a sample of n observations, which is an estimate of the expected value of x.So, for example, if we’re evaluating an investor who has invested money, you could get n observations, say annual returns, and you can take an average of them. Whatever else is done after that doesn’t matter. So, these are a couple of measures of them. Take deviations of the variable from its sample mean. So, if two variables have a +1 correlation, that means they move exactly together. This is the decline in the stock market from 2000 to 2002 or 2003 and this is the more recent decline from 2007 to 2009. I capitalized the first and the last letter, so you’ll know that I’m not–this is not the same thing as variance. We have an intuitive idea that, you know–we see the ups and downs on the stock market, and we notice them, and they all average out to something not too bad. Aristotle made this observation, but he didn’t have probability theory and he couldn’t carry it further. But the insurance concept depends on independence. And that means the standard deviation, which is the square root of the variance, is equal to the square root of n times the standard deviation of one of them. The stock market lost something like almost half of its value. It really doesn’t matter, it’s just a units thing. But the other side of it is, I just told you what to do in just a few words. And the other thing is, he started liquidating in 2000, right the peak of the market. But it seems that–I talked about the Forbes 400 people, and I mentioned last lecture about Andrew Carnegie’s The Gospel of Wealth, and he says that some people are just very talented and they make it really big, and we should let them, then, give their money away, and it’s kind of the American idea that we let talented people prove themselves in the real marketplace and then they end up becoming philanthropists and guiding our society. But you wonder, what are all of these things, all of these big movements? That’s how crazy these things are, these market movements. Then, the next thing I did is I did capital gains as a percent. I’ve just told you about one blip here, but they were so many of these blips on the way, and they all have some story about the success of some Apple product, or people aren’t buying some product. But now, what I want to do–and I have here the blue line is the return of the S&P 500. And then somehow people decided it really wasn’t so bad, so we have plus 50, almost 50% return in one month. But I think it’s this point which is bringing the β down. So, this blue line is the normal distribution, and the pink line that I’ve shown is a fat-tailed distribution that Mandelbrot talked about, called the Cauchy distribution. So, I have here a plot of a histogram of stock price movements from 1928, every day, I’ve taken every day since 1928, and I’ve shown what the S&P Composite Index–it didn’t have 500 stocks in 1928, so I can’t call it S&P 500 for the whole period–but this is essentially the S&P 500. It just came as a complete surprise to me. But that’s not what happened in this crisis and that’s the big question."
329,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-3,"In the beginning of the lecture, Professor Shiller reviews the probability theory concepts from the last class and extends these concepts by the central limit theorem. Afterwards, he turns his attention toward the role of financial technology and financial invention within society, in particular with regard to the management of big and important risks. He proceeds along the lines of a “framing” theme, referring to the context and the associations of inventions, and along the lines of a “device” theme, emphasizing the creation of complicated structures set up for a certain purpose, which require learning over time to be improved. His coverage of financial inventions spans limited liability for corporations and the framework of Township and Village Enterprises in China, as well as inflation indexation from its inception around the turn of the 19 century to its applications in Chile and Mexico in the 20 century. Professor Shiller concludes the lecture elaborating on swap contracts as financial inventions, and on the subsequent development of credit default swaps.","Today I decided not to use PowerPoint, I’m using index cards. I wanted to talk today about invention in finance. I think of finance, I don’t know whether this will encourage you to be interested or not, but I think of it as a form of engineering. And the inventions have many small details, just like any invention. We talked about central tendency, we talked about the average or mean, and the geometric average, and we talked about measures of risk, notably variance. And so, we talked about that Steve Jobs is viewed by a lot of people as the genius behind Apple, and the last time he left for a long time Apple didn’t do well. And that’s why Probability Theorists think that we kind of know the probability distribution, and that’s this bell-shaped curve which I had on the slide last period. Nonetheless, that’s what we have to talk about. If risks are independent of each other, then we can pool them and they go away. It is that society gets together and pools all of its activities. I think that’s part of Robert Owens’ idea. What we’re talking about is motivated by theory, the mathematical theory of finance, but that’s not the subject of this course. But an add-on that is, we hope, particularly effective. Another theme I want to talk about here is a framing theme. Framing has to do with language, names that we give to things. Well, I have an example of a simple invention. But you can go out and buy one now for very little money on the Internet. There isn’t always a redcap to help you, and so obviously you need wheels on suitcases. I mean you’d only invest with trusted friends. But some of those companies did extremely well, and they created a powerful New York economy. So then you have to ask why–this is an invention, but we don’t see it in other countries. And that the invention got around a legal constraint. And they did not have courts that enforced legal contracts the way we do in the U.S.And that entrepreneurs in China were inhibited from starting an enterprise, because they thought it would just be usurped by the village. This is an inflation risk that’s under concern right now after the quantitative easing that the Fed–we’ll come back to that. So the idea is, maybe we should start something else. Let’s not write contracts in terms of money, let’s write in terms of something else. They defined a consumer price index, they didn’t call it that, and they said that the bond would pay you so many pounds, they weren’t using dollars yet, they were using pounds, British pounds, the amount of pounds you would get would be increased if inflation were to start. But after the war, after the Revolutionary War ended, they stopped issuing these bonds, and they forgot about them in the United States until 1997.It’s amazing. I think maybe gimlets will make a reappearance. And people have trouble understanding index bonds, and they have trouble understanding, how the formula works. So, in 1967, in Chile they created something called the Unidad de Fomento. It should go up and down with the level, that keeps its real value constant. But we don’t seem to do it, because we can’t–something is blocking our thinking about it. It became an invention that took hold and never left that country. Well, of course, the real value goes down. By the way, guess how much consumer prices have gone up in the United States since we created the consumer price index in 1913. We have not adopted the Chilean invention of UFs. Just like we’re not used to using gimlets. And so, you need an organization like ISDA that will make these contracts work as effectively as they are. Now swaps are a hugely important contract. Well, the difference is, that there  a whole culture and regulatory environment developed around credit insurance that limited it. Credit insurance ended up being kind of limited in its application."
330,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-4,"In this lecture, Professor Shiller introduces mean-variance portfolio analysis, as originally outlined by Harry Markowitz, and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) that has been the cornerstone of modern financial theory. Professor Shiller commences with the history of the first publicly traded company, the United East India Company, founded in 1602. Incorporating also the more recent history of stock markets all over the world, he elaborates on the puzzling size of the equity premium and the very high historical return of stock market investments. After introducing the notion of an Efficient Portfolio Frontier, he covers the concept of the Tangency Portfolio, which leads him to the Mutual Fund Theorem. Finally, the consideration of equilibrium in the stock market leads him to the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which emphasizes market risk as the determinant of a stock’s return.","OK, so this is the fourth lecture for Economics 252, Financial Markets. A portfolio is a collection of investments. But first I wanted to say something about last lecture. So, it’s interesting how much got invented in this one year, 1602.First of all, they invented a corporate logo. There are more shares out there being traded than there exists in the company, because the broker is selling shares that he doesn’t own. So, the broker on the stock exchange may be short. May have sold more shares then he or she has. He was not a broker, he was a businessman. And it created a sort of a game that people were playing that turned out to be productive. So what that meant was, you could invest in this company, and it’s just a game, you know? The law doesn’t require that I investigate, you know, whether the guys who run the company are really honest. VOC, after a few years out, people thought, you know, this company is amazing. And they looked at the equity premium in many different countries around the world. And they found that all of the countries, and this is looking over much of the twentieth century, all of the countries had an equity premium, that the stocks did better than the bonds of that country. And judging from his article, to me it sounded so basic and simple. I can see right here that I can invest at 5%, right, the riskless rate, and then I’ll have no risk. So, what we have here is a broken straight line. If I have an investment company that merely buys VOC stock and leverages it, my investment company can have any expected return that you want. And so, I’ve gotWell actually, I have these absolute value marks. The portfolio expected return is just the linear combination of the two expected returns. But I’ll solve for x in terms of r, just like I did for the riskless asset. Except, this is a degenerate parabola, but it looks like this. They couldn’t figure it out in those days. I think it still survives, and seeing what he says about finance. I’ve just told you, never invest only in bonds. So, now, I want to move to a more complicated world where we have three assets. It’s xŸr + xŸr + xŸr, where the sum of the x’s is 1, $1.So, it’s something that you can do to calculate what is the optimal portfolio. And what I have actually here is the minimum variance mixture for any given expected return for the three assets. So, the better off you are, this is diversification. And now we can see, that when you do the math, you want to have all three in your portfolio. I told them in my talk, I calculate that Norway has something like 70% of its portfolio in oil. 15% oil, 53% stocks, 32% bonds, which would give them that point. But they’re not going to just pick 100% oil. So, the Efficient Portfolio Frontier is really the part of the hyperbola that’s above the minimum variance. But what I want to do now is add the riskless asset. And so, now I can achieve any point on that line. Probably something like 11% oil, 30% stocks, 50% But I could get even higher returns, if my client wants that, by leveraging. There really is, in a sense, an optimal portfolio. It’s in a sense that everybody wants to do the same risky investments. They could have just called this the investment company theorem, but history–I can’t tell you the history of thought on this. So, the cardinal implication of this theory is that the market portfolio, which is everything that’s out there in the world to invest in, has to be proportional to the Tangency Portfolio . I have one more slide about the Sharpe ratio. I’ll put them in tiny quantities in my portfolio. So, if some guy is investing and claiming to have done 15% of return per year on his portfolio, well, I’m going to look at the standard deviation of the portfolio."
331,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-5,"In the beginning of the lecture, Professor Shiller talks about risk pooling as the fundamental concept of insurance, followed by references to moral hazard and selection bias as prominent problems of the insurance industry. In order to provide an explicit example from the insurance industry, he elaborates on the story behind American International Group (AIG), from its creation by Cornelius Vander Starr in Shanghai in 1919, to Maurice “Hank” Greenberg’s time as CEO, until its bailout by the U.S. government in 2008. Subsequently, he turns toward the regulation of the insurance industry, covering state insurance guarantee funds, the role of the McCarran-Ferguson Act from 1945, as well as the impact of the Dodd-Frank bill on the insurance industry. He devotes special attention to two branches of the insurance industry–life insurance and health insurance–and emphasizes, among other aspects, the consequences of the health care overhaul in the U.S. from 2010. He discusses the example of earthquakes, with insurance in Haiti and catastrophe bonds in Mexico. At the end of the lecture, he critically reflects on the role of the insurance industry in the face of catastrophes.","I just got back from The World Economic Forum. We talked about basic principles of risk management in the preceding lecture. The basic idea is pooling of risks and preventing people from being subjected to extreme risks through the concept of risk pooling. And then, I want to talk about regulation of insurance, that the insurance industry has always been subject to government regulation. But, to me, I think insurance is an exciting issue, because it’s about making our lives work. And it’s really about preventing horrible catastrophes from–and it involves mathematical theory that underlies the concept. And that’s because things have to be done right. So, life insurance is suitably given to families, especially with young children, to protect the children. And we just heard it, intuitively, in this letter to Oldenburg long ago. Or another example is, you take out life insurance, and then you kill yourself to support your family. You might as well just sell the house, right? Then, you need a government design, so that the government verifies all of these things about the insurance company. So, these are problems that have inhibited making insurance work. So, the company was writing credit default swaps–I told you about those before–they were taking the risk. It was a complicated string of things that were done to bail out AIG. Not so much true in other countries, they have different traditions about what is the preferred price about a stock. The government didn’t know, they didn’t know whether Goldman Sachs might fail. So, these are small, they don’t guarantee you enough. There’s another thing about, at least I know about the Connecticut insurance guarantee fund, and that is that you can’t play the trick that you do with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. There’s another important difference between deposit insurance and banks and state insurance guarantee funds, at least in Connecticut. So, in the United States, regulation of insurance is divided up across 50 different states, which is kind of, makes it very difficult. So anyway, the Fabozzi book talks about various kinds of insurance, and I was going to say something about  types of insurance. And the insurance, then, has an uncertain payout. The first health insurance policy was proposed in 1694 by Elder Chamberlain. We still have the selection bias problem preventing people from signing up. The HMO Act was supposed to get us all into HMOs. So the idea is, you pretty much are going to do it, because you don’t want to pay the penalty. If an insurance company is bearing the risk, they will then go in and make sure that the building is constructed right, and so the risk is dealt with properly. I was saying earlier that an insurance policy tries to define the loss very carefully and precisely, because it’s going to end up costing the insurance company billions of dollars, they got to get it exactly right. What was the problem that hit your house? Another problem–I’m almost done here–I just wanted to talk about another kind of risk, that worries us a great deal, that tends not to be covered well by a traditional insurance company. Most insurance policies traditionally have excluded acts of war or terrorism from coverage. But it turns out, these are some of the risks that we worry most about. Risks to our health, to our children, to our businesses, to things that we do. But there are still problems in the insurance industries. So, the probability of this risk is going up. We have life annuities–I haven’t really discussed those, but they’re policies that would benefit from inflation indexation."
332,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-6,"This lecture is a guest lecture by Professor David Swensen, Yale University’s Chief Investment Officer. The starting point for Professor Swensen is an article entitled , published in  in the wake of the financial crisis from 2007-2008. This article blames his endowment investment approach for a failure of diversification and an overemphasis on alternatives. Subsequently, Professor Swensen characterizes three major determinants of investment return–asset allocation, market timing, and security selection–and outlines the importance of asset allocation as the predominant component. Against the background of these three tenets, he revisits  criticism and defends the virtues of diversification against an exaggerated perception of the needs for safety in the immediate aftermath of a crisis. Moreover, he counters the critique of overemphasizing alternatives with a longer-term view on the performance of the Yale portfolio. In the concluding question-and-answer session, he elaborates on the difference between endowment management and fund management, recent developments in the hedge fund and private equity fund industry, and on measures of investment performance beyond the Sharpe ratio.","We’ve already talked about our guest today. David Swensen has done the same with many young people. Notably, Andrew Golden, who heads the Princeton portfolio, is one of your trainees. And it talked about colleges cutting budgets, freezing hiring, scaling back building projects. So I came up here, amazed that I was responsible, as Chief Investment Officer, for this portfolio. And the first thing I did was, I looked around to see what other people were doing. And one of the first things that you learn when you study finance theory, is that diversification is a great thing. And the second thing I thought about was the notion that endowments have a longer time horizon than any investor that I know. So, the portfolios that I saw when I got to Yale failed the basic common sense test of diversification and equity orientation, and it prompted me and my colleagues to go down a different path, to put together a portfolio that had reasonable exposure to equities, and put together a portfolio that was sensibly diversified. How much in domestic stocks, how much in foreign stocks, how much in real estate. And the third source of returns has to do with security selection. And when I first started thinking about this 25 years ago, I thought, well, maybe there’s some financial law that says that asset allocation is the most important tool, because it seems pretty obvious that that was going to be the most powerful determinant of returns. But if I did that, asset allocation would have almost nothing to say about Yale’s returns. It would be the idiosyncratic return associated with Google that would determine whether the endowment went up or down or stayed flat. And we also know, that I’m not going to go back and day trade futures with the endowment. And that was a very widely read, and widely accepted conclusion. And the basic drill was, starting in 1925, looking at a number of asset classes–the ones that I’ve got here are Treasury bills, Treasury bonds, large stocks, small stocks, and then, as a benchmark, inflation–starting the investment at the end of 1925, taking whatever income was generated from that investment, reinvesting it and seeing where you end up at the end of the period. And if you’re an institution like Yale and you only want to consume after-inflation returns, so you can maintain the purchasing power the portfolio, well, 21 times, but taking off 12 times for inflation, not so good. It’s still not a huge return for decades and decades of investing. My longer-term problem was, that, if the investment committee figured out, that all we needed to do is put the whole portfolio in small stocks, and that that was the way to investment success, I wouldn’t have a job. Investors invested $13.7 billion and lost $9.9 billion, so they lost 72% of what they invested. The difference between top quartile and bottom quartile is 0.50% per annum. And I would argue that, if you expand your time horizon to a sensible length of time, that the strategy, where you hold relatively little in the high opportunity cost U.S. Treasuries, is the best strategy for a long-term investor. The amount that we distributed to Yale’s operations was $1.1 billion. Relative to an average for colleges and universities of 8.8% per annum, and $12.1 billion of value added. Another very fundamental difference has to do with the resources that we can bring to the investment management problem. You’re either completely passive or you’re aggressively active. So, that’s kind of a long way of saying, that, if somebody asked me whether stocks are expensive or cheap, my first line of defense, it doesn’t really matter all that much to me, because we’re well-diversified and because we do a great job of rebalancing. We also find, on the marketable securities side, that technology stocks tend to be less efficiently priced than many other securities. And I was wondering, also, what are the structural patterns of these markets that would prevent the market from becoming very efficient, even if there are a lot hedge funds and a lot of funds of funds. And I think that has huge consequences for endowments, foundations, pension plans, institutions of all stripes. So, there’s a huge migration of talent to the hedge fund world."
333,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-7,"Initially, Professor Shiller looks back at David Swensen’s guest lecture, in particular with respect to the Sharpe ratio as a performance measure for investment strategies. He emphasizes the empirical difficulty to measure the standard deviation, specifically for illiquid asset classes, and elaborates on investment strategies that manipulate the Sharpe ratio. Subsequently, he focuses on the Efficient Markets Hypothesis. This theory states that markets efficiently incorporate all public information, which consequently renders beating the market impossible. For example, technical analysis fails to provide powerful, short-run profit opportunities. A consequence of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis is that stock prices follow a Random Walk, as innovations to the stock price must be solely attributable to news. Professor Shiller contrasts the behavior of a Random Walk with that of a First-Order Autoregressive Process, and concludes that the latter statistical process matches the reality of the stock market more closely. This conclusion, combined with the evidence that investment managers like David Swensen are capable of consistently outperforming the market leads Professor Shiller to the conclusion that the Efficient Markets Hypothesis is a half-truth.Lehrer, “The Truth Wears Off: Is There Something Wrong with the Scientific Method?” ","And I want to talk today about efficient markets, which is a theory that is a half-truth, I will say. So, some people will say, well, Swensen was just lucky. You do a very risky portfolio, and you have high-expected return, because of the risk. He gave a reason, which was that, well, when you’re looking at a broad portfolio like Yale’s, a lot of the things in there are private equity–that means privately held, so it’s not traded on stock exchanges. So, all I have to do is fool people into thinking I have a high Sharpe ratio for a while. What they did is they calculated the optimal strategy for someone who wants to play games with a Sharpe ratio. So, you want to fool investors and get a spuriously high Sharpe ratio. So, that means you’ll get money, because you sold the upper tail. They told people that they were doing this strategy. And nobody knows whether it really has a small probability of massive losses, and you could systematically invest in that. I don’t know what the outcome will be at this point, but it just happened–bang. Even though we’ve developed this nice theory about Sharpe ratios and the like, you end up judging the person and what the person’s real objectives are. So, he was maybe a little bit too positive. The Center for Research in Securities Prices, or CRSP, as it’s called, had a Ford Foundation grant to go to the stock exchanges in the United States and get all the data, and get it right. I mean, you could find it in newspapers, but it wasn’t organized right, it wasn’t set up right. And by the end of that decade, there were thousands of articles testing market efficiency using the CRSP tape. That sounded like a long time, and a lot of data. I have here some indication of how thinking has changed about Efficient Markets. I don’t know there’s anything wrong with the scientific method, but I was interested in this article, because what  article points out is that a lot of scientists–and this is outside of finance, I’m making a parallel here–a lot of scientists who follow careful scientific procedures seem to generate results that are later discredited. And what the article says, well, it must be that somehow scientific bias, when there’s an enthusiasm for some new theory, it creeps in even if you try to make the strongest controls. Well, maybe they broke the double blind somehow. And then showed it to their superior and said, should I publish this? I don’t want any distractions; I don’t want the real world impinging on my judgment. He said, when you see this pattern, watch out. These are stock prices plotted against time. Let’s take someone who is so drunk that each step is random. And the coefficient of the lagged x is ρ. The pink line is a fake stock line generated with pure random noise. Boy, that would be a hump shape for the whole 20th century. We’d have historians trying to figure that one out. And you start looking at patterns and the patterns don’t mean anything. Because I put a trend in, it’s hard to get a real downtrend. So, you see the comparison of the Random Walk with the actual stock market. But basically, the Random Walk looks a lot like the actual stock market. The pink line is now an AR-1 process, which is this process. But the point is that it tends to hug the trend somewhat. This pink line doesn’t look as much like the actual stock market, because it really wants this trend. The problem is – and I have to wrap up–that the Random Walk Hypothesis wasn’t exactly right. The drunk is standing next to a lamp pole, it was a Random Walk."
334,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-8,"Professor Shiller devotes the beginning of the lecture to exploring the theoretical determinants of the level of interest rates. Eugen von Boehm-Bawerk names technical progress, roundaboutness, and time preference as the crucial factors. Professor Shiller complements von Boehm-Bawerk’s analysis with two of Irving Fisher’s modeling approaches, the view of the interest rate as the equilibrium variable in the savings market and the perspective of simple Robinson Crusoe economies on the determination of interest rates. Subsequently, Professor Shiller focuses his attention on present discounted values and derives the price for discount bonds, consols, annuities, as well as corporate bonds. His treatment of the term structure of interest rates leads him to forward rates and the expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates. At the end of the lecture, he offers insights on usurious loan practices, from ancient times until today, and describes the improvements in consumer financial protection that have been made  after the financial crisis of the 2000s.","We’re talking about the theory of debt and interest rates. And then, I want to get back and think about what really goes on in debt markets. So, maybe the 3% percent, or the 5%, whatever it is, is the rate of technical progress. You can make tools first and do something else that makes you a more efficient producer of this. It’s because people are 5% happier to get something now than to get it in the future. So, this is what’s talked about in your textbook and I wanted to start out with Irving Fisher because–by the way, I don’t know when this room was built. And on this axis, I’m going to put the interest rate, call that r. I don’t know why we commonly use r for interest. That is a diagram that shows a two-period story. The story I’m going to tell is that Robinson Crusoe has some food. This is the maximum he could have next period, OK? And the difference between his endowment and his consumption is his saving. The preferences I represented by his indifference curves. We’ve got roundaboutness, we have technical progress, and we have impatience. That means that his indifference curves–did you give me colored chalk? Now you understand that the interest rate in the Robinson Crusoe economy is not just about Robinson Crusoe. And the technology is the same for both of them. A is the impatient one, the way I’ve drawn it. So, this is the function of a lending market. The interest rate is the slope of this line. And it’s not necessarily easy to define whether or how impatient am I. It interacts with the production possibility frontier in a complicated way to produce a market interest rate. So, this is the model for the interest of the economy that Irving Fisher developed. They’re just both consuming more as a result. But in finance, six months is more natural. Then, the present value, depending on how I compound–well, let’s talk about annual compounding. They were British government debt that had no expiration date. If it was paying GBP 1 per year, and we’re using annual compounding, then the present discounted value is equal to GBP1/r.GBP 1 over the interest rate. That’s very simple, because this bond will always pay you GBP 1. And that’s very important, because a lot of financial instruments are annuities. And the mortgage will generally say in the United States–it’s not so common in other countries–but in the United States it will say you pay a fixed amount–well, usually it’s monthly, but let’s say annually for now–a fixed amount every year as your mortgage payment. And we want to define the forward rates implicit in those maturity formulas. And I was trying to confirm who invented the concept of forward interest rates. So, you open up the newspaper in 1925 and you get the yield to maturity, or the interest rate on various maturities. And I’m going to assume annual compounding to simplify things. This is what they were discussing at coffee hour. So, that’s 1 plus the interest rate I got on the bond. I’m not going to show you the general formula. So, instead of forming a loan between the two, we should advise them. So, this comes back to, what are we doing with our loans? And she points out that in the U.S., even back in the old days when the economy was good, we had a million personal bankruptcies a year."
335,economics,econ-252-11,lecture-9,"Professor Shiller emphasizes the worldwide importance of corporations by looking at World Bank data for corporate stocks as traded on global stock markets. He then turns his attention to the concept of a corporation, elaborating on the role of shareholders, the board of directors, and the Chief Operating Officer. Following this, he compares and contrasts for-profit and nonprofit corporations. Next, he discusses equity financing of for-profit corporations, covering market capitalization, dividends, share repurchases, dilution, and the difference between common and preferred shares. In addition, he discusses and rejects claims that share issuance is not really important for capital raising in modern times. Professor Shiller concludes this lecture with a discussion of the balance sheets of two well-known corporations, Xerox and Microsoft.","We’re talking about corporate stocks this time. We just divided it four ways and we set it up. Incidentally, in dividing up the company, I think it was just fairness. If you want to invest in stocks anywhere you live in the world, you’re going to probably come to the United States, because it’s much higher. And so, it seems like something that was learned. But I don’t want to exaggerate the importance of these, either, because the total value here for the United States is only 82% of one year’s GDP. So, the actual value of the stock market, I think most people exaggerate it in their mind. I was trying to think, why do we call it equity? The idea of a corporation is like a legal person. It’s like a slave belonging to the shareholders. The laws encouraging them did not create a swell of new companies. And the idea is that the shareholders vote to elect a board of directors. This is what they call shareholder democracy. So, my company, we did it in Massachusetts. It’s all ambiguous, but private companies don’t get donations generally. If a company never distributed dividends, it would be like a nonprofit, right? It seems a little funny, because you think, well, the board of directors doesn’t have to pay a dividend and they could just get nasty and never pay it out. And so, if you’re frustrated that our company is accumulating lots of money and it’s not paying it out. When they declare a dividend, price falls. And then after a couple of years, one of us says, I’ve got another job. Your company could also go to a bank and ask for a loan, called a corporate loan. Or your company could borrow money on the bond market, by issuing bonds. There’s been a complaint about the stock market, that the companies generally don’t issue any more shares once they’re big. I mean, people look at that price and they decide where to invest. So, what he proposed is what he called the Pecking Order Theory. And then, only if it’s really, really important and they can’t get enough money, they will go to selling their shares. So, I think that we should conclude that companies really do use equity financing, even big companies. I owned 1/1,000 of the company, and now I’m falling in half. One reason traditionally for share repurchases is tax reasons. Instead of paying dividends, I should just buy back shares. Later, General Motors got on its feet again and bought back the government’s preferred shares. Why did you decide to pay a dividend of a certain amount? And you want the company to do well and be perceived well. Once we start paying a dividend, if we stopped, it’ll get a lot of attention. So, maybe we’ll pay out half of our earnings, and the other half we’ll keep as retained earnings, so that we don’t have to go out and issue new equity or borrow money. Because, if they go up and raise their dividend, then they might have to cut it if earnings go back down. Xerox is a public company, not a private company. And I just wanted to show a balance sheet of a company, because there’s two sides to the balance sheet. In 2001, they hired a new CEO, Anne Mulcahy, and she is credited with saving Xerox, turning the company around. It might reflect time of the year or something. This number, the total liabilities, has to equal the total assets. So, the company is worth more than its shareholders equity. And this is what worries boards and CEOs. They have this nice campus in Redmond, Washington. This is really different from–Xerox doesn’t own any stock, they’re trying to limp by, they’re trying to get back in stride. But is that the way to measure Microsoft?"
336,english,engl-220,lecture-10,"This second lecture on looks at hell and its inhabitants, as depicted in Books I and II. Milton’s struggle both to match and outdo his literary predecessors is examined by way of allusions to the works of Homer and Edmund Spenser, particularly the cave of Mammon episode in Book Two of . The presence of classical mythological figures, such as Medusa and Mulciber, in the Christian hell of  is pondered, along with early distinctions in the poem, frequently blurred, between good and evil, beautiful and ugly, and heaven and hell.","Traditionally in Renaissance literature, the muses – and this will be familiar to many of you – the muses are thought to be the daughters of Memory, and the nine muses up on Mount Helicon – that’s where the muses are believed to have lived – are the offspring of the goddess of memory, whose name in the Greek is Mnemosyne. He’s taken it from somebody else, and in doing so I think he’s doing this deliberately; he’s exposing some of the darker ironies behind his own literary ambition. The problem of memory is just as important to the psychological dynamics of the fall of Adam and Eve, but as we will see when we look at Book Four, surely it’s the problem of the poet’s memory that’s the most troubling in Milton’s own faculty of memory – this is the idea that I’m going to be floating here – seems to provide something like, or pose a stumbling block or an obstacle for, his attempt to write an original, divinely inspired poem. So in this context, the river of oblivion serves an obvious purpose in the context we have here in Book Two. So this little moment, this Medusa moment, we can call it, is really quite strange. Mammon actually seems to represent the Miltonic position, or that position in the debate in hell that seems to resemble most closely Milton’s own moral temperament, we could say; and you’ll see at the end of this semester that Spenser’s cave of Mammon canto is even more central to Milton’s sequel to which is which in many ways is a more or less close rewriting of Spenser’s story with Satan playing the role of Mammon and Christ in the role of Sir Guyon, the hero. Because this is one of the most famous passages in the treatise, and it’s not one that we actually looked at for Mammon himself, I’m going to ask you to turn to This is page 728 in the Hughes,the right-hand column. Now this passage is famous for a lot of reasons, not least of which is that it’s wonderful. The palmer has been Guyon’s guide up to this point, his teacher. Milton seems actually to have forgotten something is. The temptations of classical literature are so genuinely tempting to Milton that he finds it impossible to imagine that Guyon could have seen and known and yet abstained from them without the aid of his teacher, the palmer. This is an underworld, of course, but there seems to be another underworld resting just beneath it. So this is what Milton tells us at line 678:Mammon led them on Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fellFrom heav’n…And even in heaven, we’re told Mammon was always looking down  – it’s kind of a cute scene – Mammon was always looking down at heaven’s golden pavement rather than contemplating the more elevated figure, presumably, of the heavenly father. The line between good and evil is beginning to blur. Of course, it’s with no small help from Milton’s incredibly elastic blank verse here that the headlong rush of Mulciber’s fall has been drawn to a provisional stop. Now without doubt this is a dubious theory of classical anthropology. Let’s look at a later manifestation of Mammon. In so many ways it seems that Mammon is actually echoing a lot of the political prose that Milton had written a decade before. No one can be compelled to do anything within the Miltonic theology of free will. He uses – and I’m thinking of “uses” in a pejorative way – a poet like Homer to extract what beauty he can from deep within the Homeric minds, and then he does that only to turn on Homer with that devastating dismissal: “ being singular in having composed “They” – who’s “they”?"
337,english,engl-220,lecture-11,"Milton’s characteristic use of simile is explored in Books One and Two of  Particular attention is paid to how Milton’s similes work to support, undermine, and complicate both the depiction of Satan and the broader thematic concerns of the poem, such as the ideas of free will and divine providence. The critical perspectives of Geoffrey Hartman and Stanley Fish are incorporated into an analysis of Satan’s shield and spear and the simile of the leaves.","Everyone agrees that the epic similes in are different from the epic similes in any other epic poem, and everyone agrees – I’m just going to be presenting to you a sense of critical consensus here – everyone agrees that the similes are in some way absolutely essential to an understanding of this remarkable poem. Milton’s similes are notoriously difficult as you no doubt have already experienced. So think of the article on Milton’s similes by Geoffrey Hartman. I think Hartman is absolutely right to note that it’s this aspect of Milton’s similes that sets them entirely apart from the similes in any other epic poem. Then we have the simile of the fallen leaves, which compares the fallen angels to fallen leaves, and in that simile we have the image of the Israelites. That kind of makes sense, but there’s more, of course, here than the moon to describe Satan’s shield. They always mean or signify far more than they’re supposed to if their job is simply to make a comparison. It only stands to reason, I think, that Milton would want to inscribe within this poem the problem posed by this extraordinarily compelling characterization of Satan. So, Galileo here is struggling to get the proper visionary fix on the moon at a point in the day when there are no absolutes. The rebellious artist Milton and the rebellious astronomer Galileo are continually threatening to lapse into some sort of identity with Satan himself. Surely, Satan is bigger than anything we had been assuming, but the simile continues. This is an image of an old man with a cane. We have to adjust our understanding of his physical size one more time, and of course necessarily his moral magnitude would be adjusted as well in our interpretation. Like Fish, Hartman is most interested in the similes of the first two books, the similes that provide some kind of window onto the world of Satan, and he focuses on the simile actually that follows the simile of Satan’s shield that we’ve been looking at; it follows the simile of the spear that Fish had analyzed. As you know, in classical literature the dead are referred to as shades, but here in Milton’s simile “shades” merely means “shade trees.” They argue that the similes are supposed to reassure us that there is a divine good that ultimately overwhelms the evil represented by Satan; but neither of these critics was able to discuss directly Milton’s aestheticization of the Fall in the lines on Vallombrosa. They’ve taught us how to appreciate what’s strangest and most remarkable about ,but I simply cannot agree with their suggestion that Milton’s similes work in any meaningful way to strengthen our belief in the Christian idea of the coexistence of free will and God’s foreknowledge. The Virgilian echo gives this passage in Milton an unmistakable pathos and an undeniable beauty. So, this is my question to you: how complete and perfect is the image of Providence that hovers moonlike over the pages of I think Milton is encouraging us in these similes to question, really to wrestle with, the theological certainties that the rest of the poem labors to establish."
338,english,engl-220,lecture-12,"This lecture focuses on the invocation to light at the beginning of Book Three of . Milton’s factual and figurative understanding of his blindness is traced through his letters, Sonnet XXII, and the later epic . Particular emphasis is placed on the transformation of blindness in the corpus from a spiritual punishment to a poetic gift. The implications of biographical interpretations of literature are also touched upon.",": It’s not until Book Three of  that the poet explicitly reveals to us, to his readers, the fact of the physical handicap that might reasonably be thought to render impossible his composition of the poem. He ruined his eyesight with the tireless labor that he devoted to writing that first defense of the English people. He’s continually asserting publicly that his blindness is a sign of strength. But we have a more private and a more personal consideration of his blindness in a letter that Milton wrote to his friend, Dr. Leonard Philaras, the Athenian, and this was in the  packet. In this letter to the doctor, Milton associates the onset of his blindness with the onset of a gastrointestinal complaint, and in doing this he’s following the common wisdom about the causes of blindness, which was usually attributed in the scientific community of the seventeenth century to a digestive problem. Eventually they clouded over his eyes and cut off all access to light from the outside. Now, you probably have no doubt guessed why I’m emphasizing this particular figuration of Milton’s blindness as an irrevocable change that follows the ingestion of food. When Adam falls in Book Nine of – and these are the lines that are behind me on the board here – we have a description of the almost physiological response of the earth to the sinful transgression of Adam: “Earth trembl’d from her entrails, as again / in pangs, and Nature gave a second groan.” I’m willing here and now to share with you these things that I believe actually quite passionately. It’s possible that what you have in a letter like the letter to Leonard Philaras is something like a submerged expression of guilt. Maybe Milton’s enemies were right; maybe Milton was to blame with his transgressive challenges to every conceivable form of authority. This is line fifty-one: I have lost all these things, in other words, “so much the rather thou Celestial Light / shine inward, and the mind through all her powers / irradiate, there plant eyes…” Milton is demanding for his pains the inspiration of the heavenly muse. We have in here an extraordinary image of Milton’s understanding of his own poetic output, and if this isn’t true, what we do have here at the very least is an incredibly close and intimate reading of this very invocation that we’re focusing on. Having filled himself up with a stock of verses the night before, Milton could imagine himself as a source of spiritual and poetic nourishment. Milton tells us at the beginning of the invocation that the light to which he prays was present at the creation. Their vital functions are diffused through every part. Especially as we will see in the invocation, or the quasi-invocation, to Book Seven of , the poem will continue to voice doubts that this process of inspiration has actually occurred; but you have in the figure of the Miltonic angel a literalized image, an embodiment, of Milton’s most ambitious fantasy for his poem."
339,english,engl-220,lecture-13,"In this second lecture on Book Three of , the dialogue between God and the Son in heaven is explored with particular attention paid to Milton’s modification of the Calvinist theory of predestination. The terms and implications of Milton’s attempt to justify the ways of God to man are considered. Milton’s misgivings regarding the doctrine of the Trinity are examined, and the relationship between his theology and seventeenth-century political movements is expounded upon.","I want to revisit just for a moment the opening of the invocation to holy light, which is of course, as you know, at the beginning of Book Three of . It’s this alternative syntactical possibility that I want to explore in this lecture. Johnson here is clearly thinking of Milton’s ambition of producing a theodicy, an attempt to justify the ways of God to men, and I think he’s right to identify Milton’s theodicy as really one of the central tasks of the poem. So this is Milton’s argument for Book Three. In this formulation, Milton seems to own up on some level to Johnson’s characterization of the theodicy of as a vindication. He needs to clear his name, in essence because that name has been clouded over with some kind of suspicion. He needs to prove theologically, not just poetically or narratively, that God did not place Adam and Eve in the garden with the intent or with the purpose in mind of punishing them for eating the fruit. He needs to convince himself and he needs to convince his reader, Milton does, that the fact of God’s foreknowledge of the Fall doesn’t in any way cause the Fall. I’m going to read that again: “I conclude that believers are the same as the elect, and the terms are used indiscriminately.” It placed a monarch at the top of the society, at the top of the polity. Of course, such a theory assumes a lot of things. It was being conjectured that individuals, meaning individual merchants, could freely set prices and values according to the law of supply and demand rather than according to the law of the authoritarian will of the king. The argument is essentially that a free-market philosophy had simply been unthinkable. He needs his Father’s permission and, like Adam and Eve, it’s beholden upon the Son to obey the Father. The Father of course – and it just drives me crazy – the Father speaks in the future tense of absolute foreknowledge because he can; and you’re right to think – I hope you’ve thought – that there’s something a little chilling about the Father’s discursive manner here, the way in which he can shift so easily between the past tense and the future tense. Wonderfully, the Son seems almost to recoil from the rigidity of the Father’s position. But of course, this relief is only momentary. In the New Testament, and for a lot of Christian theologians, the redemption seems to work along the lines of something like a revenge sacrifice and, as cultural anthropologists have taught us, there is something like a primitive logic, an intensely primitive logic, at work behind the notion of the Christian notion of the crucifixion."
340,english,engl-220,lecture-15,"The description of human sexual hierarchy in Book Four of  is contrasted with the depiction of angelic hierarchy in Book Five. Both the Archangel Raphael’s and Satan’s accounts and theories of creation are examined. The poem’s complex and vacillating endorsement of arbitrary decree, on the one hand, and egalitarian self-determination, on the other, is probed. The nature of matter and physical being in Heaven and Eden are explored with particular emphasis placed on the poem’s monistic elements. Overall, Milton’s willingness to question accepted religious, social, and political doctrine, even that which authorities in his own poem seem to express, is stressed.",": In Book Four of , Milton had sketched the origins of human freedom. Theirs is a continual dance of seizing and yielding. Who can in reason then or right assumeMonarchy over such as live by rightHis equals, if in power and splendor less,In freedom equal?But Milton’s poetry – well, think how odd it is,  first of all, that it’s Satan who’s giving us something like the only carefully articulated authoritative position on this, to say the least, controversial matter. Of course, we’re happy that she has a mate who’s another person and not merely a smooth, watery image. Initially for Eve, I am at least convinced there seemed to be nothing like freedom at all. I think this is one of the most moving lines in the entire poem when Eve recalls the feeling of helplessness that she experienced when she heard that voice. For a moment at least, Milton seemed to be on the brink of something like a powerful critique of the so-called naturalness of normative sexual behavior; because there’s at least some suggestion here that Eve’s attraction to Adam was not freely chosen at all. Milton’s amazingly honest in his account of Eve’s first exercise of her free will, and I think we can think of this as her first free act. So Book Four had explored in extraordinary detail the complexities of hierarchy and freedom with respect to the relation between the sexes. Sexual inequality simply seems insignificant here from this new perspective in Book Five. The entire cosmos for Milton is made of one huge blob of matter, and this matter is nothing other, ultimately, than the body of God. Right now, Adam and Eve probably couldn’t survive on angelic nectar if that is all they had to live on, probably, but Raphael adds:ime may come when men With Angels may participate, and findNo inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare:And from these corporal nutriments perhapsYour bodies may at last turn all to spirit,Improv’d by tract of time, and wing’d ascendEthereal, as wee, or may at choiceHere or in Heav’nly Paradises dwell; If ye be found obedient. This is a mobile society that Raphael is imagining. It’s a secular image of salvation certainly, but it’s a proto-scientific image of salvation. You can refer here to your handy little chronology, written by Alastair Fowler, of events in The origin of Satan’s fall is without question one of the most crucial problems that we have when we confront this poem. This is that verse: “he Lord to me hath said, Thou art my Son; I have begotten thee this day.” No one has ever known what to do with that passage from the second Psalm. Milton charges this scene in heaven with its power, I think, by juxtaposing just those two forces that he was continually attempting to unite in Book Four. That was bad enough, but it’s an entirely different matter, I think, when Satan learns – I don’t know if “learns” is the right verb – when Satan hears in his discussion with Abdiel that God created everything including the angels themselves by means of the agency of the Son, through the Son. God has impregnated matter with spirit, and after this initial act of impregnation he seems able to allow this spiritualized matter pretty much to organize itself on its own into all these beautiful and varied forms ofcreation. It also sounds like a moment in Book Three that we’ve already encountered: when the angel Uriel – the angel that Milton credits for having the best eyesight in heaven, rather remarkably – when Uriel gives us his eyewitness account of the Creation, it sounds a little bit like Satan’s."
341,english,engl-220,lecture-16,"This lecture on Books Seven and Eight of focuses on Milton’s account of the Creation. The poet’s persistent interest in the imagery of digestion is explored with help from the proto-scientific theories of the seventeenth-century philosopher Paracelsus. The moment at which Milton names and assigns a gender to his muse is examined. Finally, Milton’s use of gender in the Creation account is explored in light of previous discussions of the poem’s complex sexual hierarchy; particular emphasis is placed on Raphael’s similarly gendered account of celestial hierarchy in Book Eight.","In Book Five of Milton’s theory of monism – that’s the theory of the “one first matter” that we looked at last time – the theory of monism, or vitalism or animist materialism, there are a number of terms for it, arises in the context, you’ll remember, of a discussion about digestion. They are essentially eliminated as waste. Milton imagines so much of Christian history as scenes of digestion in a way, I think, because he needs to imagine them as occurring without the deliberate manipulation of the heavenly Father or in some way beyond the Father’s control. Literally, tartareous dregs are simply the residue, the sediment, produced by wine and vinegar. Well, Paracelsus had actually developed an entire philosophy which had as its center his understanding of these tartareous dregs, so tartar for Paracelsus was the stuff that hardened into stones within the gallbladder and within the kidney. Milton is using this incredibly striking and strange sequence of words at this point in his creation account because he wants to open up the question for his contemporary audience – it’s, of course, lost on us – the question of the nature of divine justice. In the muse’s earlier incarnations in Books One and Three, there was some uncertainty as to whether the Heavenly Spirit was a masculine figure capable of impregnating chaos and who will now impregnate Milton’s mind, or whether the heavenly Spirit was a feminine spirit, a feminine power that “dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss” or similarly sat brooding on the brooding mind of the poet. Milton conjures the fear of falling off Pegasus – Pegasus, the flying steed of poetry, “erroneous there to wander and forlorn.” So fail not thou, who thee implores:For thou art Heavn’ly, shee an empty dream. If this muse of astronomical wisdom is not truly governing Milton’s song – if she’s nothing more than the projection of Milton’s most outrageous poetic ambitions – then Milton will have no authority backing the poem’s extraordinary claims to knowledge. Think of what we’ve just read that I haven’t spoken to at all: book Six, the story of the war in heaven, is a story that doesn’t, in effect, appear in the Bible. He wants in this next section of the poem to establish a new perspective for this book of universal knowledge, and he’s relying on a new muse to liberate him in some way from the strictures of the orthodox forms of knowledge that are sanctioned seemingly so unequivocally by the Bible. So what you have in Book Seven is a really startling opposition of essentially competing forms of knowledge and competing images of authority. Look at what Milton does with the Genesis account of creation. So it’s a fallen phenomenon that Milton is placing well before the Fall. This gets me: “The grassy Clods now Calv’d.” You’ll remember that it’s in Book Eight that Adam recounts for Raphael the request that he had made to God for a partner, some fellow human. His confusion in the scientific realm can be seen to force us to reconsider his certainty about relations in the human realm, in the ethical realm."
342,english,engl-220,lecture-17,"Book Nine and the depiction of the Fall are presented. Adam and Eve’s dialogue – especially their perspectives on labor, temptation, and the nature of the garden – is examined. Satan’s strategic temptation of Eve is closely analyzed. At the lecture’s conclusion, Adam and Eve’s new fallen sight is discussed, with particular emphasis placed on the reference to the “veil” of pre-fallen innocence. Overall, the tension between doctrinal and subversive perspectives on the pre-fallen hierarchy of Eden is underscored.","We’ve been looking for the last few lectures at the ethics and the theology that have throughout been produced – at least, this has been my argument – been produced and sanctioned by Milton’s narrator. But Milton takes some amazingly interesting steps, I think, to counter what he knows will be our immediate assumptions. The importance lies more in the willingness to serve and not in the actual amount of work that’s been accomplished or in the amount of stuff that’s been produced. Milton himself was obviously always wanting to take Adam’s side in this debate, but he seems to have been continually fearful – at least this is my assumption – that Eve was right: that God requires our continual labor. You can also hear Milton making a distinction between Eve’s zeal for labor and his own efforts in writing this very poem. It’s never productive in any kind of economic sense or quasi-economic sense. So Adam is right; but while Adam is right, in a certain sense he doesn’t address directly the problem that the narrator himself has already acknowledged, and that’s the problem that the garden  the growth patterns seem to be in paradise. So, Eve to Adam:Adam, well may we labour still to dressThis Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb, and Flow’r,Our pleasant task enjoin’d; but, till more handsAid us, the work under our labor grows,Luxurious by restraint; what we by dayLop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind One night or two with wanton growth deridesTending to wild. It’s “tending to wild” because Adam and Eve are continually cutting it back – that’s their “pleasant task enjoin’d”: “the work under our labor grows, / Luxurious by restraint…” So Eve isn’t simply describing natural growth patterns in the garden: she’s examining the effects on nature of the imposition of culture. Now the syntax is a little difficult there. This shouldn’t be surprising: one of the things that Milton tries to accomplish in the narrative of Eve’s development is something like a larger theory of human development in general. As a political philosopher, Milton knows better than anyone the power of the desire for equality. Eve is musing to herself:But to Adam in what sortShall I appear? Now, from the doctrinal point of view, Eve is clearly wrong here to question her divinely sanctioned place in the order of things. I think it pushes us even further to a desire – it’s really wild. The denial of equality actually pushes us even further to a desire for superiority. But the narrative that Milton employs to illustrate this official doctrine seems continually to be questioning just that assumption. But it’s so much more complicated than that. It’s, of course, no accident that the image of the veil occurs in Book Nine in the context of our introduction to Edenic hierarchy and to the fact of Eve’s subordinate status, because the Fall itself seems in so many ways, I think, to be one of the cultural consequences of this fact of sexual subordination."
343,english,engl-220,lecture-18,"This second lecture on the Fall traces Milton’s use of the word < em>wander, in all of its forms, across the poem. The transformation of  from its pre-fallen sense to its more nefarious incarnation following the transgression is examined closely. The wider literary context of the concept of wandering, with particular emphasis placed on its importance to the romance genre, is briefly discussed. The reductive forces of Book Nine – particularly its tendency to transform the moral ambivalence, disputed sexual hierarchy, and general poetic ambiguity of earlier books into more definitive representations – are considered, with the lecture ultimately suggesting that the poem begins to turn away in Book Nine from many of its proto-feminist elements.","So the first thing I want you to do is turn to page 378. Needless to say, these are enormous changes. How big that “if” is – “if answerable style I can obtain” – we don’t actually know. It’s important that Milton has waited so long to explain his rejection of the genre of the romance as the form that his great poem would take, and that’s because the rejection of romance, I think, has everything to do, as he’s imagining it, with the consequence of the Fall in One of the most convincing elements, I think, of Satan’s temptation of Eve is his attempt to turn her act of disobedience into an act of romance chivalry. Then he continues: God will “praise / rather your dauntless virtue…”In the world of romance, the idea of obedience isn’t nearly as important as the idea of courage, or what Satan calls here in perfect chivalric language “dauntless virtue.” I think there is a way in which these two forms of rejection are closely related. The word  or  or some version of that word appears no fewer than thirty-two times in . Without question, I think, every appearance of the word is loaded. It’s a little confusing, but I’ve given us something like a schematic version of the semantic spectrum that the word  inhabits in So I guess you could think of the pure or the innocent meaning of  as purely spatial. The consequence that he imagines as most painful and most absolutely unbearable is the possibility that his mind will no longer be able to wander, so Belial asks this question, this is line 146 of Book Two: “for who would lose, / Though full of pain, This intellectual being,/ Those thoughts that wander through Eternity…” Sure, Belial is a fallen angel, and Milton goes out of his way to provide a kind of doctrinal condemnation of everything in Belial’s speech; but there’s no sense, actually, that there’s anything wrong with the general concept of intellectual wandering. It comes under a new set of ethical constraints. So let’s take a look at how that happens. This is page 393 in the HughesBook Nine, line 634. By the time Adam gets around to blaming Eve for the Fall, and of course he does that, the word has been entirely confined to the morally pejorative part of its semantic range. A word like suddenly begins to assume joints and limbs. For a while it seemed possible that the official line on sexual hierarchy was just one of the possible readings of paradisal government. There’s a new subjection of language, the subjection of language to a new altered style. He falls out of his sense of connectedness with Eve, but he doesn’t fall because he’s been seduced by his wife. The extraordinary matter of chaos is being concretized here. Moral ambivalence and poetic ambiguity has been transmogrified into something like moral definitiveness, and literary ambivalence has become literal-mindedness."
344,english,engl-220,lecture-19,"Books Eleven and Twelve of  and their radical departure from the poem’s previous style are discussed. The transformation of Milton’s famously sonorous verse into a more didactic mode is closely documented, and the poem’s increasing emphasis on visual instruction is underscored in a study of the Archangel Michael’s lesson on the history of the post-fallen world. Considerable time is devoted to both a consideration of Milton’s late politics and Book Eleven’s depiction of the destruction of paradise.","Readers typically finish the last books of with – I don’t know, I certainly had this experience the first time I read it and, I think, actually many times since then – with something like a sense of disappointment, and the disappointment that is traditionally accompanied these last books is usually associated with the question of their style. We remember Raphael’s teasing account of future history in Book Five. Milton takes extraordinary care in crafting the process of the education to which Adam is subjected in the last books. In order to understand why this section of the poem is so troubled and so worrisome, we have to understand Milton’s own brush with history, his own participation in the disappointing history of the failed Puritan Revolution. Now Milton has taken great pains to keep from his poem anything like a direct allusion to the political turmoil of his own day, but what I am hoping I’ll be able to do, at least for a few minutes here, is to show one of the ways in which Michael’s treatment of scriptural history is still intimately connected to the contemporary political history that Milton was himself enmeshed in. So now the people that Milton had once so wonderfully and movingly idealized, he’s able to refer to – and it’s really kind of jarring and, just frankly, it’s depressing – Milton’s now able to refer to the people as the – and I’m quoting here – “the rude and inconsiderate multitude,” the unruly mob. This spiritual elite would have to govern England, and Milton thinks of them as a council of saints; he refers to them as a council of saints. Someone is going to have to teach him, and in fact teach him quite forcefully, how to understand life in the fallen world. So let’s look first at the visionary aspect of Book Eleven. This scene of inspiration, I think, is strange, but of course it has a powerful charge for us, not least because for so much of the poem the poet himself has claimed to be inspired in his composition of the poem, and we know this: Milton was blind and he was convinced that something – or at least this is the William Kerrigan argument that I exfoliated for you all – he was convinced that something that he had eaten had on some level been responsible for the vaporous film that seemed to have covered his eyes. My guess is that the blind poet, Milton, is actually scornful on some level of the fact that Adam has to be inspired merely to see the events of future years. This is Milton’s description  of the cities of the plain that Adam sees, and the emphasis is everywhere in this account on those things that can be discerned through acts of visual perception. Like the beautiful sounds that are heard, beautiful sights that are seen are necessarily unvaryingly suspect in these books. This is line 598: “True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, / Much better seems this Vision, and more hope / Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past…” As so often – and this is a pattern that will repeat itself until the book is done – Adam has completely missed the point of Michael’s lesson. Now this particular image teaches us a lot more than simply the extent of this mighty flood. This is an extraordinarily bizarre temporal disjunction that we have here. Once again, in its last hundred lines or so you will have the reemergence of a lot of things that we associate with Milton."
345,english,engl-220,lecture-1,"An introduction to John Milton: man, poet, and legend. Milton’s place at the center of the English literary canon is asserted, articulated, and examined through a discussion of Milton’s long, complicated association with literary power. The conception of Miltonic power and its calculated use in political literature is analyzed in the feminist writings of Lady Mary Chudleigh, Mary Astell, and Virginia Woolf. Later the god-like qualities often ascribed to Miltonic authority are considered alongside Satan’s excursus on the constructed nature of divine might in , and the notorious character’s method of analysis is shown to be a useful mode of encountering the author himself.","For a vast number of complicated reasons, Milton has invited for 350 years now a uniquely violent – and I do think it’s a violent – response to the particular question of his value as a poet. Milton anticipated and lovingly invested all of his energy in his future literary power and his future literary fame. He published a treatise that he had written earlier on grammar, inventing his own system for the understanding and the learning of the Latin language. And so it seems to me that a useful introduction to the poetry of Milton would be a look at some of the various types of power that Milton imagines in his work and some of the types of power that literary history has tended to confer upon Milton the man, the image of Milton the man, and of Milton’s writing. Milton’s power was primarily seen as social and political and cultural. He’s already been established as a figure whose very word possesses something like an indisputable cultural power. Is this guy a revolutionary or is he a reactionary? Now we’ll fast forward a couple of centuries and look at Virginia Woolf. In 1928, and this is the next quotation on the handout, Milton has come to represent for Virginia Woolf a very different type of cultural force. He asks the Heavenly Muse at the end of the passage to help him “see and tell of things invisible to mortal sight,” and Milton’s going to need this additional help from God because, as he says – this is near the middle of the passage – because “wisdom at one entrance is quite .” Milton’s blindness, the fact of his blindness, has his view of the visible world, which would ordinarily present itself to him through the entrance of his eyes; and this  will enable him, will help him, explore the invisible world of divine truth. It’s almost as if she were saying in some way, in a post-Miltonic world, which is the world that we all live in, it’s impossible fully to look past Milton’s bogey; that the rhetoric of power, the literary strategies of power, and in some cases the very  of power, have become inextricably tied and indebted to Milton. Even the expulsion of Satan from heaven was not sufficient to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt the legitimate authority of God. The kinds of authority established by the bogeys of tradition and custom and conservative tradition are not always distinguishable from the kinds of authority that are based on genuine strength. And that’s not simply because Satan bears such a strong resemblance to Milton, as, of course, he does."
346,english,engl-220,lecture-20,"In this final lecture on , Book Twelve’s justification for the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the garden is examined alongside the Genesis account. The nature of Milton’s God, whether literal or liberal, is examined at length. The poem’s closing lines are closely read, with substantial attention paid to Milton’s final, complicated take on the poem-long consideration of Providence and free will.","Samuel Johnson in  – and that’s included in the packet, but I’ve also included this on the handout – Dr. Johnson wrote that is one of those books which the reader admires and lays down and forgets to pick up again. The Nativity Odehad anticipated a few times the apocalypse. Given that role that Michael plays, I think it’s all the more remarkable that it’s Michael – this is our killjoy archangel who’s often just as bad as Adam in his own eagerness to jump ahead of himself as he tells the story – that it’s Michael himself is the angel of apocalypse from the Book of Revelation, as we learned from David’s lecture on Friday. Perhaps because of his role in Revelation, the Michael of seems incapable of keeping himself from the onrush of expectation as he narrates, in what I suppose should be chronological order but isn’t, the story of future history."
347,english,engl-220,lecture-21,"This lecture treats the first two books of the sequel to , . The difference in style and subject matter is described. The poem’s depiction of the Son of God and Satan, specifically the characters’ seeming inability to recollect any of the events of cor the Bible, is closely analyzed. At the lecture’s conclusion, similarities between the Son’s slowly developing sense of his identity and Milton’s own narrative of his poetic development are examined.","Well, as anyone who’s read – and maybe there’s someone here in this room who has read the continuation of the novel as anyone who has read  knows, or as anyone who’s seen, let’s say, “The Bride of Chucky” or “The Fast and the Furious, Part 3,” knows, sequels are rarely greater than the original works whose stories they continue. I love this image of the old man impatient with any comment that might belittle the accomplishment of the sequel, and I think it’s a moving image. I think you’ll remember our mentioning in class that odd and sometimes irritating way in which Adam was always jumping the gun in his interpretation of future Christian history in the lesson that Michael was presenting him. The first passage that we’ll be looking at is Book Ten, line 179. It’s no wonder that Adam is really beside himself with such an eager desire to get to the end – so obsessively is this prophecy of the end presented at the end of Adam has learned about the birth of Jesus, he’s learned about the Messiah who will actually be born of a woman, called “the woman’s seed” in the Book of Genesis, and he thinks he has this prophecy of the seed completely figured out. I think there are all sorts of ways in which the poem is exploring and re-exploring a lot of the implications and a lot of the consequences of the very idea of repetition implicit or compacted in that prefix  of This is a work devoted to how the lost paradise will eventually become the regained paradise. And it has nothing to do with the magnificent battle, for that matter, between Satan and the Messiah. But there there’s another text that is repeated, if you can believe it, even more obsessively than that in ,and that’s the scene in which Jesus is baptized by John the Baptist. Satan is thunderstruck at the baptism just as he was thunderstruck at the war in heaven, but Satan himself is incapable – and this is just ingenious on Milton’s part – he’s incapable of understanding how these two moments might be in any way related. Satan is trying to figure out what God meant by his strange utterance at the baptism. Line eighty-nine; this is Satan: “His first-begot we know, and sore have felt,  / When his fierce thunder drove us to the deep; / Who  is we must learn…” So he’s able to remember the sensation of being thunderstruck in ,but he can’t connect it with the thunderous proclamation of the Son at the baptism. You’ll remember that the original motive for Satan’s fall was the Father’s exultation of his beloved Son – his now beloved Son above all of the other angels – and that the resulting sibling rivalry was the spur for all of Satan’s later actions. Satan simply cannot and will not make the cognitive connection between the rivalry he feels now to this Messiah-character and the one that he had felt, that primal, originary rivalry that had proven so devastating in Now, we may feel that we can understand on psychological grounds the reason for Satan’s inability to read the full meaning of God’s pronouncement at the baptism, but I think the true genius of Milton’s poem is the fact that the Son is just as clueless as Satan. The beauty of paradise, and by extension the beauty of is so tempting, we could say, that even the Son of God feels its overwhelming magnetic pull. Milton in the new poem is acutely aware of his already having written the great epic  and with this intense self-consciousness. This is exactly the position that the Son of God finds himself in in Look at the top of page 487, Book One, line 183."
348,english,engl-220,lecture-22,"In this second lecture on , the three temptations are examined and Milton’s unusual departure from their account in the Gospel of Luke is discussed. The poem’s tacit assertion of the superiority of knowledge and ethics over action is probed. Considerable time is spent examining the Son’s rejection of classical literature. Finally, Book Four’s allusion to the riddle of the sphinx serves as a springboard to a consideration of the poem’s Oedipal elements.","I’m actually going to continue here one of the discussions that I had begun in the last lecture, which involved the matter of the relationship of this poem, to the earlier epic, which we have to acknowledge is in so many ways the more ambitious poem, . We don’t know until the end how little the Son and Satan actually understand about themselves and about each other. This little modulation reflects, of course, the change of subject matter. But look at the way in which Milton has – this is unbelievable to me – look at how he has characterized his authorship of the earlier poem: “I who erewhile the happy Garden sung.” Now just pause for a moment and think about what kind of  way that is to refer to the magnificent epic achievement that is Milton’s alluding – he hasn’t made up this convention – he’s alluding in these lines to the opening of Virgil’s epic, and also to the beginning of Spenser’s romance epic, ; Spenser, of course, was himself alluding to Virgil. Well, on some level the speaker of the poem, Milton’s narrator – we can call him Milton – joins Satan in this act of repression, and the speaker of this poem has repressed the fact of the war in heaven as well. It suggested in some way that the Father approves of the individual who is willing merely to wait to be called to work. He’s tempting him to provide himself with something to eat. In short, Satan tempts the Son with just about everything that was ever important to our John Milton. In the temptation to Parthian military glory, you can hear Milton’s conviction in the regicide treatises of 1649 and thereabouts, his conviction in the importance of destroying with force, by actual military power, the unlawful tyranny of Charles the First. This is a good example of the way in which Milton will cast as a Satanic temptation the voice of virtuous conscience that had plagued him as a younger man. Look at line 224:Why move thy feet so slow to what is best? ….. This temptation to immerse himself in pagan literature at home, of course, is the temptation in that has to be most difficult for Milton to imagine resisting. He has to figure out once and for all what that meant. In essence, if you are in fact the Son of God, prove it! This is where the angels are singing in praise of the Son. Look at that last line that I just read, line 608. He remembers that was, in fact, an epic and according to Milton it’s this revelation which is the moment at which man is redeemed. His patricide is closely related to what is happening at the actual narrative of the poem when the Son of God realizes at that extraordinary moment that he himself is God. On the poetic level, as a poet, Milton is rewarded."
349,english,engl-220,lecture-23,"This introduction to  focuses on a psycho-sexual reading of the poem, with particular emphasis placed on the poem’s peculiar association of sexuality with violence. The characterization of Dalila and her similarity to Samson is discussed. The problems inherit in Miltonic heroism, especially self-sufficiency and the nature of heroic sacrifice, are expounded upon.","We ended the last lecture, or actually I ended my last lecture – The last lecture was Matt’s  – I ended my last lecture on with the brief consideration of the riddle of the sphinx. The leanings, at least, of the Powell family, it has been conjectured, contributed significantly to what turned out to be merely the temporary erosion of Milton’s first marriage. Let me just digress here for a moment and explain to you why I pronounce her name “Dalila” . Who knows why Milton wants to classicize these names rather than using the English transliteration of the Hebrew! That was just a pronunciation digression. It involves an elaborate trick staged by friends of both Milton and of Powell. This scene bears an obvious resemblance to the initial entrance of Dalila into the poem, Now there’s no proof, of course, that Milton’s is a reworking of this biographical event in the stormy life that was Milton’s domestic – the stormy career  of Milton’s domestic life. They’re mirror images of one another, but obviously they represent utterly different things. This is page 564 in the Hughes,lines 529 and following. Then swoll’n with pride into the snare I fell Of fair fallacious looks, venereal trains, Softn’d with pleasure and voluptuous life…Now, the voluptuous life that he’s describing here in line 534 is – what is this? These are just simply lies that she’s telling, and in a lot of ways, Milton does seem to be setting her up as a type of Satan, Satan who on Mount Niphates at the beginning of Book Four of was continually contradicting himself. In both instances the hero is seen to have relinquished his masculinity. Samson as the champion of the Hebrews is supposed to be able to submit himself utterly to the will of the Father, not Manoa but the heavenly Father, but the play reminds us overwhelmingly and continually that even the greatest heroes are subject – and you can tell that Milton was an enormous fan of Shakespeare’s tragedy, which explores a lot of the same problems – but even the greatest heroes are subject to other far less dignified forms of submission. Of course, it’s a domestic space that had been utterly purged of any type of sensuality, but in the space, the place of maternal affection and domestic peace – of just happiness in one’s domestic life – is continually threatening to contaminate the hero, and obviously this is a hero who’s a lot less well adjusted, we could say, than the Son of God. Here in Milton’s final poem, we have an acknowledgment that the process whereby one becomes a Miltonic hero is potentially ruinous. Maybe we’ll have time for a brief consideration of what it is that Samson does for employment, what his job is."
350,english,engl-220,lecture-24,"In the final lecture of the course, the analysis of  comes to a conclusion with an exploration of the poem’s sexual imagery. Milton’s choice of subject matter is puzzled over, as are the ethics of his tragic hero, particularly when compared to the heroes of Milton’s previous epics. The poem is positioned as a means by which Milton ultimately resolves the poetic, religious, and career-related crises of his earlier poem, “The Passion,” and the compelling relationship between the corpus and the poet’s biography is revisited one final time.","It’s been said that if didn’t exist, then we could say with something like perfect confidence that John Milton could never have chosen Samson for a hero. This is where I reproduced the end of the Judges version of the Samson story, and so according to the Hebrew Bible these are Samson’s climactic actions at the Philistine Festival of Dagon."
351,english,engl-220,lecture-2,"Milton’s early ode, “On the Morning of Christ’s Nativity” (1629) is presented and discussed. The author’s preoccupation with his standing as a novice poet and his early ambitions, as carefully outlined in the letter to Charles Diodati, are examined. The ode’s subject matter, other poets’ treatment of the Nativity, and Milton’s peculiar contributions to the micro-genre are discussed, including his curious temporal choices, the competitive attitude of his narrator, and the mingling of Christian and classical elements. The rejection of the pagan world in the poem’s final stanzas is explicated and underscored as an issue that will recur throughout the corpus. Additional reading assignments for this class meeting include “At a Vacation Exercise in the College” (1628), “On the Death of a Fair Infant” (1628), and  (1629).","It’s fitting that the first poem of Milton’s that we study in this class is “On the Morning of Christ’s Nativity.” But there’s an important and, I think, a very real sense in which Milton wanted to make it seem as if the Nativity Odewere the first poem that he had written. And it wouldn’t be another twenty-two years after  until Milton actually published Now I am mentioning these dates here because the dates on which Milton wrote and published his poems, the temporal sequence of these publications, have a peculiar and particular importance for the poet. Now in the first original poem that Milton wrote in English, titled “At a Vacation Exercise,” Milton – and you will come to recognize this as so unbelievably Miltonic – Milton doesn’t write about love or about death or about any of the subjects that typically engage the youngest practitioners of poetry. Milton’s subject in his first English poem is – we can guess it: it’s his future literary career. Milton claims that epic poetry is the highest ambition for a poet and then he goes on to explain how it is that the epic poet should comport himself. Hast thou no verse, no hymn, or solemn strain, To welcome Him to this, his new abode…?We’re struck, I think – or at least I’m struck – by what I find to be the oddly negative, almost scolding tone that Milton is adopting, really quite inappropriately, I think, in this address to the muse. highly attuned to the etymological prehistory of the English word . Christ, whose Nativity Milton is honoring, is still just a baby. This is the straightforward, perfectly understandable competition to be first. Isaiah in this passage is describing a crucial moment in his career, his career as a prophet: the moment in which his lips are cleansed and he is empowered –  empowered – to speak prophetically. What exactly that purgation will entail and why Milton’s voice needs to be purged at all – I think these questions are really the subject of the entire rest of the poem. The hymn, the large part of the poem, can be divided roughly into three sections. The stakes of coming first seem are getting higher and higher. He will have to do battle with this temptation forever: the temptation offered by classical literature. But Milton knows that the general feeling of the thing is, of course, going to be Christian, and he’s probably taking as his model at this point the Italian poet Torquato Tasso who wrote a slightly earlier Christian epic poem, romance-epic poem, that Milton greatly admired. He is more steeped in the sensuous beauty of classical literature, the classical tradition, than probably anyone else of his generation. Milton calls upon a whole range of violent, exciting, militaristic images, and set-pieces to describe the triumph of Christ over the petty gods of paganism, but this routing of the gods brings with it a certain cost. Suddenly, the literary genre that Milton is writing in is no longer this triumphant classical ode. We may imagine that henceforth, now that he has written his Nativity OdeMilton has fully expunged from his literary system that youthful attachment to the pagan classics."
352,english,engl-220,lecture-3,"This lecture examines the role and meanings of the word in Milton’s life-long meditation on (and concern for) what it means to be chosen by God. Milton’s profound anxiety in the years following his graduation from Cambridge regarding his poetic career and, more specifically, his status as a Christian poet selected by God for greatness is outlined. The topic is traced through Milton’s polemical treatise , the poem , and the author’s correspondence. Particular emphasis is placed on Milton’s interpretations of the parable of the talents and the parable of the workers in the vineyard. Substantial context on the nature of election and salvation is supplied from the writings of John Calvin and Max Weber.","We’ve looked at Milton’s earliest poem, or what Milton wants us to think of as his earliest poem, from a couple of different perspectives. I need to explain something to you about where I’m coming from. ”It’s this drive to constant self-definition that becomes the characteristic feature of Milton’s work for later generations. Milton is magnificently free of the pressures of modesty and reticence. Now it’s clear here that Milton is imagining this future work, the work that “aftertimes will not willingly let die,” as the fulfillment of a professional career. He was able to produce all those magnificent plays simply by instinct: a kind of natural urge produced and generated all of that poetry. And I’d go so far to say that most of the really, truly memorable moments in Milton’s poetry and prose have been generated by some version of just this conflict. We need some proof of our salvation simply to get up in the morning actually, when you think about it, and the only proof for so many of Milton’s contemporaries seemed to lay in the degree of visible success that they seemed to have enjoyed. Milton is the son of what is the equivalent of a modern-day banker. would lend you a sum of money for which you would pay him interest. It’s little wonder that one of the subjects of his meditations during this period is the problem of vocation – the twin problem of what it is one is actually doing on the one hand, and what it is on the other hand that the father has called one to do. And if it’s a poet that you want to be, to what extent can the writing of poetry be considered respectable work?”Look at pages eighty-two and eighty-three in the HughesMilton’s expressing a dutiful degree of filial piety and gratitude, and this may seem familiar, too. “ This is a contract with his father in this passage. will have to be postponed to the great hereafter. And how can Milton have anything to show for his talent until he has – this is the logic – until he has patiently waited for God to inspire him to write? I was therefore afraid and I went and hid thy talent in the earth. And the parable is a horrifying one because it places such an unspeakable pressure on the interpreter to produce something, to show something for himself at the end of the day. All of us just as human beings, all of us want to be rewarded. The friend has obviously chided Milton for not doing anything with his life. Perhaps we want to write like Shakespeare, maybe we want to be a writer like the great Old Testament prophet Isaiah. It’s perfectly inscrutable as far as I’m concerned."
353,english,engl-220,lecture-5,"This second lecture on Milton’s masque probes its complex depictions of virginity and chastity. The version of the masque performed in 1634 is compared with the published version of 1637, with particular emphasis on a monologue on the vanquishing powers of virginity that is created for the latter. The poet’s commonplace book, specifically his notes on the self-mutilation of the medieval nuns of Coldingham, is linked to images of the body in the masque. Milton’s gradual revision of his initial position favoring life-long virginity is described in detail.","Milton is typically cited by literary historians as one of the first major English poets to praise in verse the institution of marriage. They’re a couple whose marital blessing had been granted by none other than God himself. I think we could make some estimation of its significance if we juxtapose it with since attempts to tackle, in a much more expanded form, so many of the same issues. is an elaborate meditation not simply on chastity but also on the threat of rape. The potential danger besetting the Lady is certainly a subject of some concern for her dutiful brothers. In this particularly odd image you have something like a veiled accusation – and it’s not unlike Comus’ accusation – that the Lady is hoarding her God-given treasure of her chastity, with all of the resonances of the parable of the talentsthat we see in Comus’ similar language. Now it goes without saying that we all know what virginity is. The Protestant Reformation, and especially the rising energies of Puritanism in the early seventeenth century, are beginning to do a lot to change this state of affairs. The form of this maskis that of the romance. In some important way, I think, the Lady can be seen as being in the same position that Milton had been representing himself in so many of the early poems. The lapse makes a certain kind of sense, I think, because it’s virginity and not married chastity that the Lady imagines will allow her to demonstrate such a remarkable show of rhetorical strength. We can’t know just what force virginity would exude, and so the speech leaves us where we began, in a state of uncertainty concerning the ultimate strength of this virtue of sexual abstinence. He’s also stuck between two models of speech with which we have become quite familiar by this point. On the one hand, he wants to wait before he talks. It was almost as if Sabrina’s assent from the Severn stream to assist the Lady in her time of need suggests Spenser’s arrival from the realm of English literature to assist the young poet, John Milton. That would be one literarily allegorical way to think of it. He is no longer – or no longer wants to be – an , a poetic virgin, a speechless poet. The Lady remained much more fixed in her idealization of virginity and a lot more silent in her responses to Comus, but it’s almost as if the prospect of publishing this mask seems to have induced in Milton an interest in trying to move beyond the idealization of virginity, beyond simply the anticipation of future power. Now it won’t be until another four or five years after the publication of that Milton will himself actually be married, but the transition from virginity to married chastity charted in this poem that we’ve been looking at nonetheless reflects a marked interest in the nature not only of Milton’s personal life but in the nature of his literary interests."
354,english,engl-220,lecture-6,"Milton’s poem  is discussed as an example of pastoral elegy and one of Milton’s first forays into theodicy. The poetic speaker’s preoccupation with questions of immortality and reward, especially for poets and virgins, is probed. The Christian elements of the poem’s dilemma are addressed, while the solution to the speaker’s crisis is characterized as erotic and oddly paganistic, pointing towards the heterodox nature of much of Milton’s thinking.","The best way, I think, to introduce the central issues of this wonderful poem, is to return to Milton’s .So yet once more – and I promise this will be one of the last times that we look back at Milton’s mask but yet once more, let’s look at Now you will remember that the mask was everywhere concerned with questions of the power of – well, the strangely intertwined questions of the power of chastity on the one hand and the power of poetry on the other. Now to the extent that this discussion is actually about the virginity of the Second Brother and the Elder Brother’s sister, it seems, I think, to border on the ridiculous; but the debate, I think, we have to take seriously. The position that Milton – this is how I like to read it – the position that Milton would like to be able to take on this question of virtue’s reward is formulated by the Elder Brother in . Then this simply isn’t a world worth living in. The Elder Brother is challenging God to see to it that some kind of justice is actually effected on this earth; and so I’m going to be placing a particular amount of pressure on this passage because this is the first expression in Milton of a very particular kind of argument: a religious argument, and it’s one that becomes central to all of The speech of the Elder Brothers is a theodicy. The young man was named Edward King, and he drowned in a shipwreck in the Irish Sea shortly before he took up orders as a minister for the Church of England."
355,english,engl-220,lecture-8,"Milton’s political tract  is discussed at length. The author’s complicated take on state censorship and licensing, both practiced by the English government with respect to printed materials at the time, is examined. His eclectic use of pagan mythology, Christian scripture, and the metaphors of eating and digestion in defense of his position are probed. Lastly, Milton’s insistence that moral truths must be examined and tested in order for goodness to be known is explored as an early manifestation of the rhetoric that will be used to depict the Fall in .","We looked last time at Saint Peter’s declamatory speech in ,and we spent a lot of time on it. Now as with most political groups who suddenly find themselves – and this is just an ancient piece of wisdom that I’m sharing with you, but it’s something obviously that you will have heard before – as with most political groups who suddenly find themselves in possession of a measure of power, the ideas and values of the Presbyterians, who had of course started out as radicals, were beginning to harden into something like a new orthodoxy with this new aggregation of political power. The Revolution has essentially become a revolution in name only. This is a recurring rhetoric, this notion that there is a cancer in the body politic. Milton doesn’t denounce censorship at all, although it comes up. Censorship is the banning of books that have been published and that have been deemed by the state authorities to be dangerous or harmful in some way. Only after that point can a text actually be censored. This is where Milton speaks of the importance of censoring dangerous books. Look at the next paragraph:I deny not, but that it is of greatest concernment in the church and the commonwealth, to have a vigilant eye how books demean themselves as well as men; and thereafter to confine, imprison, and do sharpest justice on them as malefactors. The metaphors, or the rhetorical world of the treatise, seem so often to be against censorship. So in Milton’s argument against licensing, Milton explains the importance of the coexistence – and it’s very moving, it’s an argument for diversity – the coexistence of so many conflicting opinions and beliefs. of gender nonconformity and cultural relativity. He wants to explain the usefulness, the value, and, in fact, the beauty of religious controversy; but when you read an intensely poetic, highly ornamented passage like the one that we’ve just looked at, I think you can see why Milton was so interested in this contemporary problem of religious diversity in the first place. And Milton’s defense of controversy seems in a lot of ways continually to be slipping in to something like a defense of poetry, or certainly a defense of his own poetic practice. It’s because this action of eating is so absolutely central to the plot of that we are obliged to spend – let’s spend the rest of our time here focusing on Milton’s consideration in this treatise, in the of 1644, of the problem that we will find haunting :the problem of the eating of the fruit, and the problem of God’s prohibition – God’s censorship – of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Milton elaborates on this claim that we should read and prove anything we want, for we are sufficient to judge aright. There are so many things to say about this passage. You’ll find Eve in Book Nine of voicing essentially this same sentiment when she’s explaining to Adam why she needs to work separately. It has to be tasted before it can be conquered. The extent to which Milton succeeds in justifying such a God in will be, of course, one of the questions that we will be exploring over the next couple of weeks."
356,english,engl-220,lecture-9,"The invocation to  is read and analyzed. Milton’s tenure as Latin Secretary under the Puritan government, his subsequent imprisonment upon the restoration of the monarchy, and his blindness are all briefly discussed. The poet’s subsequent choice of a religious subject, rather than a nationalist one, for his epic is considered in light of the failure of the Puritan regime. His radical poetics, including his stance against rhyme and his unique use of enjambment and double syntax, is closely examined. Elements of the radical philosophy of monism, present in his depiction of angelic bodies, are identified and discussed at length.","In the invocation to Book Nine of Milton describes – and it’s wonderful to see this representation of this process that, I think, we’ve been wondering about – he describes the process by which the heavenly muse inspires, and he says inspires nightly, the composition of his epic. After all, this is an extremely pious Puritan. Nonetheless, even blind, Milton served the new regime as both a state licenser – and I won’t even get in to the irony of the fact that Milton seems to  actually become the licenser, the licenser of printed text that, of course, he had seven or eight years before so utterly abhorred in He seems to have had some work as the state licenser, but also more importantly (and this was a much bigger commitment) as the nation’s Latin secretary, which means that he would compose and translate all of England’s correspondence with the governments on the continent into and from Latin. It’s late for some personal reasons as well. There had been a half century that had passed since any great modern epic or romance epic had even been produced. The problem with my awkward, metrically proper reading of that first line is that the word “first” insists on being accented, and it screws up the template: “Of man’s disobedience, and the fruit,” and so Milton is rebelling against an implicit law of poetic meter in the very first line of what, of course, we know will be this extraordinarily self-conscious poem. The spirit to whom Milton is praying was the actual vehicle through which God created the universe. The first is the radical theology, and the second is this poem’s equally radical and equally daring original verse form. It seems to be the case that Milton rather late in his life has become a monist. So physical life, physical matter, for the mature Milton is never lifeless or dead. He impregnates it with spirit, and he gives it a potency of life. People can’t deal with this poem until they can get a handle on the fact that it doesn’t rhyme. The divine soul is everywhere in the Miltonic body, the human body. Milton wants us to think of the sense of his verse as being similarly infused; the poem is similarly infused throughout with some kind of soul or spirit or divine energy throughout the entirety of a verse paragraph. So Milton imagined that his own verse was to be read and experienced something like a body. They’re made of matter just as human beings are, but their bodies aren’t compounded of separable elements. Now this little discussion that Milton’s given us here on the ambisexuality of his angels, not unlike perhaps the ambisexuality of his God, seems to have little to do with the discussion at hand of the heathen deities, but I think it has everything to do with Milton’s understanding of his own verse, which he has freed from the bondage of rhyming just as angels are freed from the manacles of joints and limbs. In its amazing malleability of form, having dismissed the manacle of rhyme, the poem is teeming with the same kind of erotic energy – this is, I think, Milton’s fantasy for the poem – the same energies that charge that image of books in So let’s look at an example of how this might actually happen, a way in which the verse actually seems to generate this sensation of bodily freedom. He frees himself – this is an insight that William Kerrigan has also had – he frees himself from the strictures of conventional syntax, and he places that phrase “in the Beginning” at the beginning of the line, very strangely and very awkwardly before the “how”: “in the Beginning how the Heav’ns and Earth.” He permits enjambment to become the verbal medium."
357,english,engl-291,lecture-10,"In this lecture on J. D. Salinger’s , Professor Hungerford presents her argument about religion in the novel as an example to students of how to construct a sound literary critical paper using evidence from the text. Moving between large claims and close readings, Hungerford shows how Salinger prevents his investment in mysticism from becoming mystification by grounding his sense of the divine in the specificity of persons, the importance of family language and love. In this way writing, like the theme of acting that appears again and again in the novel, models a spiritual performance that brings together artist and audience in the partnership of human communication.","In light of the fact that I have just sent you paper topics, my lecture today is going to do two things. It is really going to give you a whole packaged reading of We have just the one day on this novel, and what I’m going to be doing for you is modeling the way literary critics use evidence to advance an argument. Our writer for today thinks so highly of that capacity of literature to embody the human voice that he imagines a whole religious world around him. What can you observe at first glance about its style, about its form, about its setting, about its character, about its presuppositions? Tell me what you noticed, at first bat, if any of you have read it. But Zooey has a more substantive objection. So, just to review: Franny has her breakdown when she comes into what I suspect is New Haven to attend the Yale-Harvard football game with her boyfriend, Lane. “If you don’t understand Jesus, you can’t understand His prayer. Jesus was a supreme adept, by God, on a terribly important mission. But, to anyone paying attention to the other things that Zooey says and the other things that he does in this novel, this is kind of odd, and it’s hard to square. That’s the other nice thing about literary arguments. If you want to know the goddam truth, that makes an actor in the first place. We know that Franny is an attractive young woman. And I would remind you, looking back to that passage on page 65 and into the 66, that specifically among the figures that Buddy mentions, the religious and literary figures, we find Shakespeare. In the diner, in the apartment: all you do in the apartment is move from one room to another. It even has a curtain hiding Zooey from his mother. Acting becomes a religious practice for much more than Franny, not just for Franny and for Zooey ‘cause Zooey’s an actor too. Zooey finally suggests that it’s attention to the audience that makes an actor really a special actor, a religious actor, and he points back to advice that Buddy gave him about–sorry, that Seymour had given him–about performing on a radio show. A dial tone of course followed the formal break in the connection. Zooey’s voice breaking that dial tone in the beginning in his phone call, and then the resumption of it afterwards, that dial tone encases Zooey’s voice, so that what Zooey says to her is one of the rays of light of God’s creation, one of those things, like Shakespeare, that is part of the whole created world, but what Franny can tune into, after hearing his voice, is that very essential divine sound, meaningless sound. It’s nothingness that is the mystical state rather than everythingness."
358,english,engl-291,lecture-11,"In her lecture on John Barth’s collection of stories , Professor Amy Hungerford delves beyond the superficial pleasures and frustrations of Barth’s oft-cited metafictional masterwork to illuminate the profound commitment to language that his narrative risks entail. Foremost among Barth’s concerns, Hungerford argues, is the multi-faceted relationship between language and love. Desire can drive a narrative, or disrupt it. Language can create desire, or replace it. Unifying the virtuosic variety of his tales is Barth’s inquiry: Does language always stand in for a loss of bodily presence? Must the written word always exist as the shadow of the oral?","Let me ask you a question first about John Barth and the stories that I asked you to read. Which of them was your favorite?“Night-Sea Journey”“Night-Sea Journey”Why?I thought it was the profoundest joke I’d ever read. It has wit; it has developed characters; it has a coherent narrative. And I once got from him a handout that he would give to his fiction classes, and it had on it all the traditional tricks and structures of the short story form. So, this is one of the sad things about teaching Barth for me. Once upon a time there was a story that began once upon a time there was a story that began once upon a time.” But he invites us to do this to his story. What’s he trying to teach us about narrative and about language that makes it worth this risk?Now, let me just make the last point I want to make about this, and that’s that because language is material, it has form, it has both closedness and possibility, it’s susceptible to the workings of craft, it’s also unpredictable. Of course it’s from : “I have seen the best minds of my generation….” We can think of that in another way, as well, though. Well, the first thing to notice is that, unlike Queequeg, he does not sign that mark. He has no agency in this trajectory he’s entering upon. So, if you look at it here on 95, we’re told in the course of the story about Ambrose and Magda and the family:The action of conventional dramatic narrative may be represented by a diagram called Freitag’s Triangle: A, B, C–If you read on down in that paragraph, you will see that Ambrose in his frustration–in his effort to control the story that is always, in this story, spinning out of control–he wants to be able to use Freitag’s Triangle to prop up what has become an uncontrollable narrative and give it a shape. years later when that vast suspected area of the funhouse came to light, the first expedition found his skeleton in one of its labyrinthine corridors and mistook it for a part of the entertainment. He would be quite famous in his line of work. You put your penny in the slot and it works to produce the narrative. This is like that moment of erotic play with Magda for Ambrose. To love is easy; to be loved as if one were real, on the order of others: fearsome mystery! So, it’s a way of reminding you that you’re not really alienated, but this is what Menelaus cannot get his head around. This is what Menelaus has to ask forgiveness for. And, in that sense, I think it has something in common with Nabokov’s fantasy of the living artwork. And so at the end, the comic ending of “Menelaiad,”which echoes the comic ending of Odysseus’ trip back home, of he says:Menelaus’s story itself in ten or ten thousand years expires, yet I’ll survive it , I, in Proteus’s terrifying last disguise, Beauty” spouse”s, odd Elysium: the absurd, unending possibility of love."
359,english,engl-291,lecture-12,"Professor Hungerford introduces this lecture by reviewing the ways that authors on the syllabus up to this point have dealt with the relationship between language and life, that collection of elusive or obvious things that for literary critics fall under the category of “the Real.” The Real can shout out from a work of art, as it sometimes does in , or haunt it, as in . It can elude authors like Kerouac and Barth for widely different reasons. Placing Pynchon firmly in the context of the political upheaval of the 1960s that he is often seen to avoid, Hungerford argues that Pynchon–no less than a writer of faith like Flannery O’Connor–is deeply invested in questions of meaning and emotional response, so that  is a sincere call for connection, and a lament for loss, as much as it is an ironic, playful puzzle.","Before launching into Pynchon today, I thought I would just take a few moments to look back over the books that we’ve read and talk about the visions of language that they have offered us, and also just to reflect for a moment on the relationship imagined between those visions of language and what is happening outside of fiction in what we might call the real world. So, this is part of a larger intellectual trajectory. Barth is not alone in thinking these things about language. And do that as a way of finding what’s true about yourself; do it in the company of others. When this book first came out, critics called her a lightweight. I want to suggest to you that he did that because a woman is expected to occupy certain conventional roles at this moment, and we see her in one at the very beginning of the novel. This is when she first meets Genghis Cohen. So, these names drag associations with them, and one question I want to ask is: what to do with those? Now, this may seem like a small aside, but if we look also on 73, when she meets Mr. Thoth, she says (on the very top; he’s telling Oedipa his dream, and she sees in it clues to the Thurn and Taxis mystery):Oedipa, sensitized, thinking of the bronze marker, smiled at him as granddaughterly as she knew how and asked, “Did he ever have to fight off desperados?”And then, of course, she gets a major clue for figuring out what the whole story is behind the Tristero and the post horn. “ The sun on the bright, beige countryside was painful. Both hands, smoke white, covered his face. But here, it’s infused with her compassionate approach to this man. She reflects, later, on the set of all men who had slept on that mattress. Pynchon wants to imagine a very physical repository for the social, and especially for the human, affective dimensions of the social. That’s why Oedipa has all these men stripped away from her. Remember, I argued that Lolita has a dead child, and she dies in childbirth, in a way, because it’s a kind of creativity that Nabokov wants to cancel, or that Humbert wants to cancel. So here, she’s kind of enthralled with the idea that these gemlike clues–that’s a very Nabokovian moment–the gemlike clues that are gathering around her would be a compensation for the loss of that real access to revelation. It’s not just the religious instant of looking down at San Narciso; it’s the religious sense of the capitalized Word that comes back a couple of times towards the end of the novel, the epileptic Word. And, I would submit to you that tears are just all over this novel. I don’t know if you noticed it, but there are many, many examples."
360,english,engl-291,lecture-13,"Professor Hungerford draws a contrast between Toni Morrison and most of the writers studied up to this point in the course by pointing out how, for an African-American woman writer in particular, language is a site of violence. For all of her power to recuperate the voices of the oppressed, the novelist must be wary of the ways that breaking the silence, too, can constitute an act of invasion. As in the case of Pynchon, the word in  enacts a near-physical touch; this is its pleasure and its danger. With inimitable complexity and grace, Morrison weaves her narrative around a young black girl who, in the void of her social persona, constructs a beautiful and poisonous fiction.","So, today we will talk about This novel has a lot to do with the questions that John Barth was thinking about, in a very different register, in This is, of course, the story of a little girl who is totally remade by a story that’s told to her, and I just want to point this out to you, on page 182 of This is the letter that Soaphead Church writes to God explaining his action. He has, remember, tricked Pecola in to thinking that if something happens to the dog that he sends her out to feed, it will be a sign that God has answered her prayer for blue eyes. If John Barth’s characters inhabit stories, stories that precede them in the world– Remember, this is why it’s important that the narrator of the first story in that collection is the sperm. Turn your back on the war,” says Ken Kesey. Now, I’m sure there are a thousand reasons, but we’re going to–I’m going to–bring some of them out of the novel that we can read right there. So, why write a novel instead of writing a tract or becoming a sociologist or a politician? One reason, for Morrison, is that the novel allows the voices of the oppressed to speak in a way that they could not otherwise. So, by including Pauline’s voice, she allows Pauline to begin to tell her own story of how she became married to Cholly Breedlove and how she evolved in to the fairly hateful woman that we see her to be when we see her as Pecola’s mother. You might find, and I have to admit I myself find, that particular example quite clunky in a literary sense. He’s getting less popular as the weeks go by. Suddenly he realized that Aunt Jimmy was dead, for he missed the fear of being whipped. There was his father, a man like any other man, but there indeed were his eyes, his mouth, his whole head, his shoulders lurched beneath that jacket, his voice, his hands, all real. And then, when he flees from that scene, finally, and soils himself, he becomes another one of those abject characters. He, at any rate, was the one who loved her enough to touch her, envelop her, give something of himself to her. When Cholly is described as having freed himself, earlier in the novel, part of that story which we don’t get explicitly is that he has learned to turn his hatred, finally, against the white men, symbolized by the white men who discover him making love to Darlene in that earlier scene. She wants us to see him in a sympathetic light. But all those other versions are equally fictional types of prostitutes. There is an assertion of their opacity right there. And it limns the place where they might come to stand in and of themselves, without embellishment. The primer is run together so that we can see how it becomes nonsensical in the context of Pecola’s life."
361,english,engl-291,lecture-14,"In this lecture at the midpoint of the course Professor Hungerford takes stock of the syllabus thus far and to come by laying out her guiding thesis of the Identity Plot, a rubric for understanding novels in the twentieth century as, she argues, the Marriage Plot is a rubric for understanding novels in the nineteenth century. Referring to examples throughout the syllabus, but especially Maxine Hong Kingston’s , Hungerford describes the overriding tendency of American novels written after 1945 to explore the tension between individual and collective identities and to interrogate the artistic and political stakes of competing notions of authenticity.","It is the seventh week of term, and in this class, if you have kept up, you have read nine novels in seven weeks. For the big arguments, you want to be able to account for what is obvious about the period, but perhaps has not been justified as an analysis of the period. What hasn’t been said before is that it has this particular name, and I use this name because, for me, the Identity Plot, which I will explain in a few moments, fulfills much the same function in fiction of this period as the Marriage Plot did for the Victorian novel. Authenticity: Is Menelaus’ voice in really his own? Has his identity been lost in his wrestling with that changing god? She is in fact deranged by her conflicted relationship to identity. Now, here is where we need a distinction between literary fiction and genre fiction. There is something operatic about the extremity of the situation we’re given, the extremity of the use of those conventions in Well, in this case some of our Identity Plot novels use that plot to say something about language, about literary history, about tradition. The character seems to be a member of the majority group. They’re white; they are from an upper-class section of New York; they’re distinguished by their family’s intellectualism. Similarly, Ambrose could be said to be in the majority group, and certainly by the definition of someone like Morrison or Kingston, that fiction–they’re members of a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant heritage, the members of Ambrose’s family. They, too, are marked by their difference from the churches in town, the independence of their thinking, the skill with which they carve; they have artistic skills. You can have a variation with fiction based on fact. And this is an example, this last one: Identity is not based on race or ethnicity. Now, you have to define your time period. This happens a lot in Dickens, other kinds of Victorian fiction. So, you have to be prepared to explain how your feature is different from other incarnations in the history of literature. Even writers of the genre fiction versions have to address an audience looking for the familiar pleasure, but with just enough difference. There’s all kinds of things you can close read in here. So, the illogic of this little moment at the very end of the book reaches back to all those other examples of illogic and insanity that we see throughout: classic new critical technique for building the meaning of a certain trope across the writing. So, I’m not going to go on with this, but I just show you that little passage and suggest some of the ways that it’s built up over the course of the book to show you that Kingston’s novel or autobiography–even though it fulfills the convention so completely that it looks like genre fiction–if you locate it in 1976 when it was first published, it’s not at the end of a long line of these; it’s at the beginning."
362,english,engl-291,lecture-15,"Professor Hungerford situates Marilynne Robinson’s novel  (1980) in a tradition of American writing about the individual’s relationship to nature that includes the powerful influences of the Bible, Herman Melville, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. The loss of identity that Emerson describes as becoming a “transparent eyeball” in the woods, Robinson brings into the realm of the home, the built environment. The individual voice and its guiding consciousness are all mixed up in the material substance of the world, giving them a concurrent fixity and fragility that it is Robinson’s talent, and our challenge, to explore.","Today I wanted to begin with that question I left you with: What does have to do with the Identity Plot? Ishmael wants to enter into dialog with you, wants you to reach out towards him. She herself was not from a Jewish family. So, there is an exchange, as in the biblical story, between the mother that she has lost, in this novel through the mother’s suicide. There is also that sense that she follows the aunt into a wandering life. You will have to think about, as you get to the end of this novel, whether there is an end to the wandering in ,or whether it is an unmitigated wandering. So, the biblical reference, as well as the Melvillian reference, suggests wandering. They’ve made their summer very long, starting at March. When she further dreams of the resurrection of the whole train, all the family at the bottom of the lake, it allows her to imagine herself and Lucille in this warm, coherent embrace in a more fulsome way. The restoration of the family, the resurrection, is precisely what then will liberate them to do exactly what they’re doing now, running off to the woods, being truant. So, if you think about that construction, “I don’t know what I think,” it posits an “I” who could know the self. While it was dark, despite Lucille’s pacing and whistling, and despite what must have been dreams (since even Sylvie came to haunt me), it seemed to me that there need not be relic, remnant, margin, residue, memento, bequest, memory, thought, track or trace if only the darkness could be perfect and permanent. And this is a positive condition for her, insofar as it seems to eliminate the need for things like memories, traces, remnants, that list that we’re given. If that is true, we might also think of 126, the dictionary full of pressed flowers. And, in this case, the practical task is Lucille’s effort to blend in with the town. So, if language comes, almost viscerally, from nature, here we can see exactly how Robinson is in the realm of the nineteenth-century Transcendentalists, and here I’m going to read you a little bit from Emerson’s essay This is what he says about being in the woods. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life, no disgrace, no calamity leaving me my eyes which nature cannot repair. Man beholds somewhat as beautiful as his own nature. So that, in the end, is what constitutes something like identity in this novel. Now, on Wednesday, in the very short time I will have, I’ll talk about what that voice has to do with the question of loss which haunts this novel in every sentence, as I’m sure you’ve noticed, very elegiac sense to this novel."
363,english,engl-291,lecture-16,"At the very beginning of the course, Professor Hungerford offered students the opportunity to pitch a novel of their choice to fill the final spot on the syllabus. Today six students rise to that challenge, presenting their arguments for why each book would complete the intellectual trajectory established thus far. While the Teaching Assistants tally the results of the class vote, Professor Hungerford provides some final thoughts about the theme of loss in Marilynne Robinson’s . The effacement of the body in this novel, and the beauty of absence and hunger, result in what Hungerford terms an “anorexic aesthetic” that raises problems for feminist interpretation.","If you don’t have a ballot, there are some down here. I’m Emma Barash, and I am pitching by James Baldwin. And what distinguished the men was that they seemed incapable of age. He and his Merry Pranksters went on the road in their Magic Bus touting it across the nation. Oh, just some background information: While he was writing ,he was working in a mental institution. I’d like to read a passage from the book. So, I think you can see the confusion that can arise from having an insane narrator. She’s both damaged and, as a result, utterly unreachable. The inevitable is, in many cases, trivial fates dealt out at cocktail parties. So, ,I think, fits very nicely into the syllabus because it provides a beautiful contrast to in that it depicts the disintegration of southern California, and specifically L.A., in a much less manic, but no less troubling way. There are only certain facts,” I say, trying again to be an agreeable player of the game, “certain facts, certain things that happened.” This is a sort of stupid analogy, but I imagine it’s sort of like getting on a highway in L.A. (not during rush hour) but heading to where you’re going, maybe east towards the hills, and you get to your exit, sort of, before you realize it. I’m just going to play a clip from the movie that was made of the book. ’That was a clip from the movie version of ,and this is the book. Then there was tinkly music of which I could very nearly make out the tune. I will be truthful again and mention that before this voyage I had the opinion that Jewish people were having shit between their brains. As for reasons why you should want to vote for it or read it, I think the first thing which many of us in the section realize about the book is just that it’s really engaging. As far as tying in to the course matters, this book is a great, great study, and, I would think, an unprecedented study, as far as the Identity Plot goes, for our class, because as a black African the protagonist is identified not by his ethnicity in the United States, but by his race. Whatever I do, however I find a way to live, I will tell these stories. I think that quotation from Marilynne Robinson that I gave you at the end of last lecture, about how she aims to speak in the voice of the consciousness of the person–not necessarily the words that they would use if they were to write their own account–suggests that what she is getting at doesn’t require that kind of historical explanation to account for it, that she doesn’t want us to have to think of Ruth speaking from a particular place, which is also a way to say that Ruth is gone; somehow Ruth is absent from us. The logic here is that vanishing makes the voice totally present; that full human presence is in the voice, somehow inherent. This is at the very end of the novel, and I want you to think, as I read it, about the difference between this passage and the one I read from about Pecola, that passage of negativity about her being a kind of blank or a negative, against which all other virtues could be present in the world. However Lucille may look, she will never find us there, or any trace or sign. And, in general, I could feel that I was breaking the tethers of need, one by one."
364,english,engl-291,lecture-17,"In this first of two lectures on , Professor Hungerford walks us through some of the novel’s major sources and influences, showing how McCarthy engages both literary tradition and American history, and indeed questions of origins and originality itself. The Bible, , , the poetry of William Wordsworth, and the historical narrative of Sam Chamberlain all contribute to the style and themes of this work that remains, in its own right, a provocative meditation on history, one that explores the very limits of narrative and human potential.","So, tell me: I asked you to read over break; was this a happy Spring Break task for you? What does that mean?I just remember, reading it, it felt like a nightmare. This prose concentrates so much on the material of the world, absolutely, and it does have that feeling of drawing you into its world very completely. How are we to make sense of that in the evolution of the art form? The second thing, in the second lecture, that I will focus on is what to do with detail, what to do with that odd detail that you notice in the novel. He lived out of hotel rooms, even when he was married and had a son, when he was a young man. Ahab is known for his monomaniacal evil, his evil quest to take on the white whale. sprophet, who occupies the same structural spot, accosting the main characters as they go out on their journey, is much more playful. He is thoughtful; he’s funny; he is a little self-mocking; he can wax both grand and silly; he can recognize his own silliness. He is a very different kind of character, and that leads us to wonder how we need to understand his failure to shoot the judge. Now I’m going to move to my second in line, here, and that’s McCarthy rings the changes on the great voices of American literature, but also of world literature in English. Well, this is taken directly from Satan instructs his fiends in how to make gunpowder, and I’m going to read you a little bit from Book 6 of So, the fiends are down in Hell strategizing, somewhat in despair over their chances against God’s angels. The other way this sheds light on the novel is to say that the novel is concerned, like ,with the great cosmic structures of the world. In the opening lines of this novel, we see the line on page 3, “All history present in that visage,” the face of the kid, “the child, the father of the man.” You see lots of Garden of Eden imagery there. There is an echo there of Cain and Abel, even though they are brothers. I want to go, now, to my last in the pile of books. The Glanton Gang is a historical fact, as far as we know. So, this isn’t giving you the paintings that I want, and I’m going to–These are two that I took up. Well, here it is in Chamberlain’s .Now, I want to read to you a little bit from the .The second in command, now left in charge of the camp, was a man of gigantic size who rejoiced in the name of Holden, called Judge Holden of Texas. This is a problem that, I think, McCarthy’s quotation, that I wrote up on the board, points towards: “The ugly fact is that books are made out of books.” This is what someone, a reader like Harold Bloom, might say. There is a lot of anxiety about origin, right here in these couple pages. There is a sense in which he can almost understand it."
365,english,engl-291,lecture-18,"In this second lecture on , Professor Hungerford builds a wide-ranging argument about the status of good and evil in the novel from a small detail, the Bible the protagonist carries with him in spite of his illiteracy. This detail is one of many in the text that continually lure us to see the kid in the light of a traditional hero, superior to his surroundings, developing his responses in a familiar narrative structure of growth. McCarthy’s real talent, and his real challenge, Hungerford argues, is in fact to have invoked the moral weight of his sources–biblical, literary, and historical–while emptying them of moral content. Much as the kid holds the Bible an object and not a spiritual guide, McCarthy seizes the material of language–its sound, its cadences–for ambiguous, if ambitious, ends.","Starting on page 312, here is the little detail. He did not avoid the company of other men. What this says to us is that McCarthy has built the structure of the narrative along the familiar line of the Bildungsroman, the novel of a boy growing into a man. You don’t have an Ishmael character whose mind you can see into. You can see it, also, in a late example of the judge. ”The judge, here again, singles out the kid as having somehow betrayed the gang, and he suggests that–this is on the prior page–he has lied to the authorities. There is a preface to the Modern Library Edition of this novel where Bloom argues that the kid is the hero against the heroic evil of the judge. This is the first place where the kid is noted to appear in this section. It looks like the kid is approaching him as a kind of act of mercy. ”I think what he means there is that David Brown would have killed him, would have killed the kid if he had had the chance, somehow, in his moment of pain. These moments look like a kind of mercy, but I’m going to argue that they are not, in fact, instances of mercy, that in the end they are not accountable for by any kind of moral calculus, that they resist that kind of evaluation. It seems to be all about moral contention, and the point of the story, from the judge’s point of view, is to show that evil is an inheritance. So, the son of the harness maker becomes a killer of men, too, but that the lack of a father (The traveler, we find out, had fathered a child who was as yet unborn, and so that child when born is, as the judge says, “euchered of his patrimony.” He never learns that this man was a human being, and therefore that he could never be the kind of ideal he can be as a dead man. ”Think about that claim, in the context of a historical novel: “The past that was differs little from the past that was not.” My novel stands on an equal plane of authority. In these passages, I’m suggesting that it’s a literary authority coming out of a Miltonic tradition, perhaps out of the tradition of great American novels like but it goes much deeper than that, and this is where I get to my original little detail of the Bible, the illiterate kid holding the Bible. Robert Alter–who, if you’ve studied the Bible in any college course, you’ve probably at least come to know his work–he is a great translator of the Old Testament, and he came out recently with a version–I think it was in 2004–which he titles It’s the Pentateuch, and it’s retranslated in a very startling style."
366,english,engl-291,lecture-19,"In this lecture on , Professor Hungerford traces the ways that Roth’s novel conforms to and pushes beyond the genre she calls the Identity Plot. Exploring the various ways that race can be construed as category, mark, biology, or performance, the novel ultimately construes the defining characteristic of its protagonist’s race to be its very concealment. Secrecy is, for Roth, the source of identity and the driving force behind desire and narrative.","As I mentioned last week, on Wednesday I’m going to give my censorship lecture, and in preparation for that I would like you to go to a local bookstore, any one, and just observe how it’s laid out, what you see, what your attention is called to, what your attention is not called to, and here’s a difficult question: What isn’t there? You want to ask yourself, what kind of history is each writer invoking?I want to suggest to you that if you press on the markers that Roth chooses, you will find something more than trivia, more than contemporary trivia, that Roth has in his sights an equally universal, trans-historical kind of truth in this novel, that’s brought up by those little details of history. On 144, you get another version of that, slightly more personalized to his family. This is on page 93 when Coleman is describing or we’re having described to us exactly how Coleman’s father taught them to speak. So, Doc Chizner takes that transgressing use of precision that we see in the cocker spaniel metaphor in the child’s imagination, and he shows Coleman how to apply that to living race in America, living his race in America. There is a third way of thinking about race, and that, of course, is as biology. So, we get a whole description of Coleman’s body and what it is that Nathan sees in it, suddenly, now that he’s shirtless on this hot summer night, and also now that he is no longer talking about the “spooks” business. Was it because the pit coach didn’t know he was colored? He talks about concentrating, and how the secrecy is produced by the concentration, or is related to the concentration on the one thing that you’re doing. Whatever is to be mastered, he becomes that thing. Biology becomes his secret, not as an academic subject, but as a lived experience. That term “counter-confessional,” being–the pleasure and the power were in–being counter-confessional in the same way you were a counter-puncher, in not telling–this is quite a remarkable term for Roth to use. It doesn’t mean, even, that it can be known. First, on the question of pure difference, on 47, in that wonderful scene of Faunia with the cows, this is Nathan reflecting on the desire that he sees enacted there. Desire is that force that’s always reaching toward something that is separate from you. Difference between human beings is just that, in this scene, just the engine of desire. So, on Monday next I will talk about that relationship between desire and the literary, between persons and characters, between life and novel."
367,english,engl-291,lecture-1,"In this first lecture Professor Hungerford introduces the course’s academic requirements and some of its central concerns. She uses a magazine advertisement for James Joyce’s  and an essay by Vladimir Nabokov (author of , a novel on the syllabus) to establish opposing points of view about what is required to be a competent reader of literature. The contrast between popular emotional appeal and detached artistic judgment frames literary debates from the Modernist, and through the post-45 period. In the second half of lecture, Hungerford shows how the controversies surrounding the publication of Richard Wright’s  highlight the questions of truth, memory, and autobiography that will continue to resurface throughout the course.","Today I am going to do a couple of things. It just makes the whole thing work a little easier and it prevents that drop in the pit of my stomach when I see half of the class leave. There are questions that intersect between the form and the content in every single novel that we read. Maybe that’s miniscule, but maybe it’s going to be fun for you, especially if you have a sort of theatrical bent, or if you like getting up in front of people, or if you’re just really, really passionate about a novel that you want everyone to read. So that’s the piece of the syllabus that I can’t tell you about. But I don’t expect you to become an English major in order to do that if you’re not already one. Some of the novels have that, but not all of them. So what do you do with those on a syllabus? The average man”: this advertisement wants you to see as a story about a man you can identify with. The reader should prefer a story with action and dialog to one with none.” “ There are at least two varieties of imagination in the reader’s case, so let us see which of the two is the right one to use in reading a book. How many of you are guilty of this kind of reading, ever? Well, what is it about?So what is the authentic instrument to be used by the reader? To be quite objective in these matters is of course impossible. Everything that is worthwhile is to some extent subjective. Well, this is what happened to Richard Wright. So he had published in 1940 to great acclaim, a very successful novel. Now the part about his life in Chicago was the part that was finally cut from the novel–I’m going to keep doing this, call it the novel versus the autobiography, and I’ll explain why I make that mistake a little later–it was cut from the autobiography. This is a scene of whether you as a writer compromise yourself in the face of authority that resists what you want to say. To write about your life and to pretend that you’re communicating the memory of what happened to you–your grief, your private grief–doesn’t contain that universalizing move that fiction, by its very essence, contains. And you see that (you can remember back to that conception of literature we see in the advertisement for ) it’s about everyman, that greatness in literature comes from its ability to speak to some archetypal Everyman, Any Man, and Faulkner capitalizes those words in his letter as if they really are types. And even though in that little passage he suggests that it’s a struggle to be truthful, a struggle to be accurate, a struggle not to dress up your feelings with some sort of embellishment, he at other times says that, well, some of the stories did come from other people, some of the stories he included did come from other people’s experiences, not from his own life, and that this is allowed and allowable because what he aimed to do was produce a generic life of a black boy living in the South. The writers on the syllabus consistently try to imagine a way to make those claims, make those claims for the primacy and the importance of what they do."
368,english,engl-291,lecture-20,"In this lecture Professor Hungerford discusses how the novels we read are shaped by legal and market constraints. She traces a history of censorship from the Comstock laws, to the policing of Joyce’s  and Ginsberg’s , and shows how changes in publishing practices have tended to penalize more unusual, less profitable books. Hungerford also touches on the canon debates of the 80s and 90s (citing John Guillory and Toni Morrison), and the issues of intellectual property and internationalization raised by digital literature. Finally, she points to some ways that Philip Roth, despite his controversial representations of Judaism and of women, succeeds in tackling fundamental human concerns.","Today I’m going to talk about censorship in the United States since 1945, in the period that we’re studying, and I’m going to connect that with and some of my general thoughts about Roth’s work at the very end of lecture. So, does anyone want to tell me what they saw on their little observation trip? Diverse in what way?Diverse, culturally, as far as the history books that I looked at. But the way that profit was made has changed from the early twentieth century until this point, and I’m going to say more about that. Taking out classes, books you buy for pleasure, your own decision to buy them, how many of you are still buying those in bookstores? The reason for that is that censorship and what I’m calling censure–that’s the public outcry against literature, even not on legal grounds–is a way for the culture to speak back to the literary. So, that’s why it was important for someone who wanted to keep out of American hands to call it obscene. All they had to do in that trial, and it’s very funny to read the transcript, is to prove that Ginsberg in was doing anything remotely resembling literary work. And a suit is brought against that school system for doing that. And so school libraries can’t be regulated in that way. Not that far, in certain sectors of the country, in certain ways of thinking. Traditional publishing has undergone a huge consolidation since the 1980s. One of the Pantheon editors led a revolt when this happened. So, there was a management of lists that could be tilted to allow different kinds of books into the public domain. Well, agents are very busy now, with their clients selling movie rights and such things. So what that means is the culture is finding new arbiters. So the internet experiments with all kinds of both new and tried and true ways of using money to create prominence among the welter of information. And the dream is that this will be a sort of bonanza of access. Writers of color are much more prominent; there are many more points of view present in that canon. So, it wasn’t that the content of particular poems would be communicating something about an elite bourgeois ideology, but rather that the very act of being in the institution where you would study such a thing (at Yale, in English 125) that was the repository of the elite power of these texts. And that’s what I appreciate about literature in general, that it’s that great attempt to cross that divide."
369,english,engl-291,lecture-21,"In this final lecture on , Professor Hungerford argues that desire is the engine of narrative, for Roth, both at the structural level and in the very grammar of his sentences. Sex and writing are alike in their attempt to cross the boundaries between persons. Passing does not only occur racially, but is also likened to the process whereby a writer, like Roth or his proxy Nathan Zuckerman, comes to inhabit the subjectivities of other characters. One effect of these conflations–for example, Nathan standing for Faunia as he dances with Coleman–is to raise the threat of homoeroticism, which for Roth collapses difference with same-sex desire. Such stereotypes are a controversial characteristic of Roth’s fiction, which nevertheless continues to draw great admiration.","So, today I’m going to give my second and final lecture on My first lecture focused on identity, and my final argument about the novel in relation to the question of identity is that the first half of the novel comes down on the definition of identity through secrecy, that what makes you who you are–anyway what makes Coleman the person he is–is his secrecy. “ What you are not, you then desire; what you have not, you then desire. So, her body is a kind of revelation to Nathan, and then she fills in some details that we can see recapitulate material that has come in an imaginative form, different imaginative form, earlier in the novel. So, there are two moments when Nathan claims to be seized by Coleman and his story. There is a sentence on page 164 I want to direct your attention to. She remembers it at all hours day or night, awake, sleeping or insomniac. One is that Nathan, if you recall, has been rendered impotent by his surgery. Now, there are a couple ways of thinking about that homoerotic structure. She wrote a famous book called ,and her argument is that, in a lot of–I think her subject was Victorian fiction–in a lot of Victorian fiction, the homoerotic or the homosocial bond between men is channeled through a woman, and the perfect example of that, in this novel, is when Coleman and Nathan go to the dairy farm to watch Faunia. And the mother realizes, the mother of Tadzio realizes there is this sort of lecherous man coming after her boy and warns him, Tadzio, to stay away from Aschenbach. She’s playing with her hair and thinking that her hair is like seaweed, a great trickling sweep of seaweed saturated with brine, and what’s it cost her anyway? So, if it’s desire for the same–understood as gender, the important sameness being gender–then it looks like a self-canceling desire, a desire that can’t sustain itself, somehow, or that lacks that fundamental structure of difference that the whole novel seeks to set up. So, this is one way to understand the problem, and it goes back to speak to my point about inhabiting, or being a parasite upon, Coleman’s story. And it should remind you of all that’s said about life being an argument. There are two things, two implications that flow from that. So, I will finish by saying Roth is an extremely important writer in this period because of the very complexity with which he makes the texture of his novels speak to the question of fiction’s relationship to life, writing’s relation to life, and the relationship between the writer and what he or she writes, the writer and the work. These are questions that vex writers in this period. Roth does it in a way that nobody else particularly does. So, he’s highly regarded, although there is split opinion, as you can see, there, about which of his novels is really the best one."
370,english,engl-291,lecture-22,"In the first of her two lectures on Edward P. Jones’s , Professor Hungerford begins from the novel’s title, asking what counts as knowledge in the novel and why knowledge is central to the story. This leads to related questions: who is a knower, and what can be known? Highlighting several different versions of how knowledge of the past is communicated through storytelling within the novel, she draws distinctions between Jones’s model of historical knowledge and that of other writers on the syllabus. Professor Hungerford suggests that Jones revives a nineteenth-century form of the novel when his narrator takes on a God-like omniscience, but unlike the nineteenth-century novel’s narrators, Jones’s omniscient narrator provides little in the way of God-like consolation.","Today, of course I’m going to talk about the second-to-last of our novels. Well, this is kind of an unfair comparison to make, because of the morality issues, but it reminded me of ,in the sense of its quality of lots of different thoughts and events. So, it used to be that historians felt that they could know the past; when they had gained a certain distance from it, it would become knowable, that objective distance. There are some wonderful stories from medieval French literature, for, example that Foucault talks about, that feature girls who jump over ditches and suddenly become boys. And I think some of the revisionist history that you see taking place in fiction– and here I’ll have recourse again to demonstrates the belief in language’s power to make history. It’s clear the novel values the tiny version of narrative. So, with all those sort of abstract questions in mind, I want to turn to the novel and look at how knowledge, especially knowledge of history, knowledge of the past, is generated. It was gospel among slaves that one of the quickest ways to hell was to tell lies about dead people, but Moses did not think about that as he spoke of the first nail, did not think about the dead needing the truth to be told about them. What Moses does, then, is stand up against folk wisdom, and he takes on for himself the power of a masterful creator. So, he does himself what he assigns to Henry. The warning from the collective wisdom stands at odds with his individuality at that moment. There is a blurring of the distinction between master and slave. That’s the origin that Moses is lying about, so there are two layers of lies here. And this is in the middle of the page.)He had seen a dark old man driving the wagon, not really a Negro, not really from any race that was recorded in any of the books in his destroyed library. He doesn’t look to a historical setting that’s distant from himself. So, her argument is that the past is what you make it usable for; the past becomes its use for you. There is that omniscient sense that the narrator has all the pieces under her control. So, God is seen, in this little, tiny snippet, to be totally arbitrary and I think that’s the sense you get in most of these passages about the divine, that God allows violent actions to occur without seeming cause, without reason, and it’s up to the human beings to try to stitch stories together that can make sense of them. It’s in those moments that he speaks something closest to the truth, right, that we can hear him speaking to us the truth of slavery, and to his interlocutors the truth of slavery. How do we know where this knower is situated?"
371,english,engl-291,lecture-23,"In this second lecture on , Professor Hungerford addresses Edward P. Jones’s ambitious and ambivalent relation to literacy. Jones shows us the power of narrative to bring together the fragmentation of the world, but is at the same time deeply aware of the fragility of text, all of the ways it can be destroyed, misinterpreted, abused, or lost. The son of an illiterate mother, Jones–who, it seems, composed and memorized large portions of before setting anything down in print–models a form of literary self-consciousness infused with the moral dilemmas of slavery and freedom that is unique among contemporary novels.","My first lecture on focused on the question of knowledge and the problems of knowledge that the text raises for us throughout, both at the formal level and at the thematic level. Jones sees his mother very much as a source of his writing. That’s why the mother has to go in his right hand in this scene. Henry did this with the shaker several times. So, this is just one of those that doesn’t quite get articulated, but Calvin can imagine that it’s there; he can see, as if he can see the form of the novel that Jones is writing. And then there are just even tinier ones. None of these claims are adjudicated in any kind of way that puts one above the other, and Skiffington’s weakness, of course, is that he will never seek to right that balance. So, after Travis has eaten Augustus’ papers–this is at the very bottom of 212–“a wagon twice as large as Augustus’ came up to the four men. Now, I’m sure you’ve noticed how much carving goes on in the book, not just because Augustus is a woodworker, but because Elias carves for Celeste; that’s his first act of love. and so, as he told Skiffington, lost his hunger and thirst for books. It can be passed from person to person, and it maintains its figurative power. So, it has a very evocative narrative power that doesn’t depend on people’s being able to read it, and we’re told in that scene that the boy receives it as if this is what he had been waiting for all along, suggests a perfect receptivity, no going blind here, perfect receptivity. He had first come to know Augustus Townsend many years ago through a chair Augustus had made for a white man in the town of Manchester. Well, it gave nothing in terms of knowledge to Travis. Despite all of Moses’ stories, she still cannot see him, or anyone else, as a free person. There is that sense that this is still something that needs to be protected. So, he went on vacation after a long time. What I was saying about the durability of the plastic arts is imagined in that quality of his fiction. If there is something truly postmodern, I would say Jones is it."
372,english,engl-291,lecture-24,"In this first of two lectures on the students’ choice end-of-semester novel, Jonathan Safran Foer’s  (2002), Professor Hungerford models several methods for approaching and evaluating a new work of fiction. She shows how Foer borrows and adapts themes and styles from other authors on the syllabus in service to his ambition as a writer to demonstrate the power of narrative fiction to address the great historical traumas of our time. In thus attempting to marry the nineteenth-century social novel with Postmodernist, or late Modernist, techniques, Foer participates in an emerging tradition that risks the confusion between resonant emotion and sentimental cliché.","So, today we’re going to talk about and Eli has actually agreed to stand next to me for the whole lecture and translate my lecture into Ukrainian dialect. So, this is actually a perfect novel for me to lecture on in that respect. Sure.…experimenting with speaking through the voice of a character. He certainly studied with Joyce Carol Oates, but Morrison was around and I’m sure he has read that novel. It would be surprising to me if he has not. And it’s the trouble that interests me, and that I think he takes from Roth: and that’s the impossibility of ever actually making that connection, of it ever finally coming home. This is at the bottom of 140.Those who prayed came to believe less and less in the god of their creation, and more and more in their belief. It’s the same structure as the belief in belief. It is an infection that bothered critics about this novel. So, he described it as the social novel coming to meet the postmodern novel. And the father has Alzheimer’s, and so there’s a very Pynchon-esque scene, when his, actually, his shit starts talking to him, and this is taken right out of There’s a scene very similar to this in So, Franzen tried to make that poignant by making it something that the modernists tried to do, which is the representation of the actual workings of the human mind in a daily situation. And, a lot of the way that we come to know the character Jonathan Safran Foer in the beginning, through Alex’s letters, has to do with things that he has said to Alex about how to write, suggestions he’s made. Apparently, there is a whole spate of novels that came out right about the same time, where Americans, almost invariably young men, went to the former Soviet republics and had coming-of-age experiences. And, just to note how he cues us, let’s look on 142 and 3. It is amazing, yes, how your grandfather survived so much only to die when he came to America. Here are some topics that I want you to write about just for ten minutes,” and I would give them “love,” “your childhood”–what else–“death.” He can do it because it’s in Alex’s voice. And, I think you get that payoff because she is developed; she has time to develop, in the course of the story. That, to me, is a kind of achievement, because of the role that riffing plays in the development of that story. I think what Foer does, that Roth didn’t do, is fully identify with the community in a convincing way, while he’s doing it, and this is related to what I will say about his use of the Holocaust in my next lecture."
373,english,engl-291,lecture-25,"In her final lecture of the course, Professor Hungerford evaluates Jonathan Safran Foer’s  with respect to one of her areas of expertise, American writing about the Holocaust. She points out how the novel takes on some of the questions of trauma theory in its examination of both the pain and the healing power of repetition. The most innovative characteristic of Foer’s novel is, for Hungerford, the way it addresses the inheritance of the Holocaust for third-generation Jews in America. The novel finds new ways to provide witness for and connection to their grandparents’ experiences in Europe, but also displaces a traditional Holocaust discovery narrative from the Jewish child of survivors to the Eastern European grandchild of those complicit in the destruction of  life.","The exercise of inviting you to choose our last novel, as I think I explained in the very first class of this term, is an exercise in thinking together about what defines a period of literature. Somehow they think about something in a way that I haven’t known anything else to think about before. So, for me, it doesn’t quite meet that criteria, but “representative” and “widely read,” certainly. Its power is waning, I think, although there is a new interest in Sociology in trauma, now. It’s as if it’s a moment in which trauma is transmitted through language, and is imagined to be transmitted in an unmediated way; so, the repetition that we experience as readers, all of these horrible things are said twice, because we see Alex translating them, and that’s dramatized for us by the device of Alex as translator. Now, by the time Jonathan Safran Foer is writing this book, not only has Holocaust Studies established this whole body of thought about language, but there are also many examples of what you might call the American Holocaust Novel, and the one I’m going to use in my lecture today, to think about in relation to this, is Art Spiegelman’s graphic novel How many of you have read it? We find out fairly early in the first volume of it’s a two-volume graphic novel–that Art’s mother killed herself well after she arrived in America as an immigrant, having escaped, and we see her in an inserted cartoon in a different style in the bathtub. So, what do you do to make that story your own? However, this novel is loath to part with the drama that earlier stories made from the recovery narrative. The parents won’t talk about what happened. And we see that choice thematized in the Holocaust sections of this novel. Europe is where the important history happened. Have you ever witnessed anyone in the photograph?” And so Alex comes to be undone by what he finds about himself, what he finds out about his grandfather and his family. And who is lying in the bath with their wrists cut? So, that makes it quite interesting to me, and I just want to look on 262 at another way that transposing the story outside of the Jewish community radiates out in this novel, and maybe mitigates that suggestion of a revenge plot, and this is on 262 when suddenly the first-person plural appears. There were times when I could not afford to sacrifice the bloom of the present moment to any work, whether of the head or hands."
374,english,engl-291,lecture-26,"In this review session for the final exam, Professor Hungerford fields practice questions in an open forum so that students know what will be expected of their performance. She offers study advice from her own experience, and gratifies students’ curiosity about some of her own preferences and reservations regarding choices for the syllabus.","I’ll go ahead and start, just ‘cause I am not sure how many people will end up being here. So, as promised, today I will tell you a little bit about the exam, and I’ll show you some questions from a past year so that you can see what they’re like. In the essays I always give three and you choose one. Now, so, let me show you now what these look like. What do you notice about it, about the language? You would have to talk about that to get full credit for an answer on this one. Yes, and then he just wants to sort of paint a picture of his own morality. That’s what sets up the novel; that’s the frame of the novel. Absolutely, yes, so that would be perfect, nice and economical. What else do you see there that you could comment on? Henry and Caldonia have this vision of a pure morality that they could sponsor in their slave-holding life, and, similarly, this is Barnum Kinsey speaking. One is to associate it with literacy so that just  is a way of testifying, somehow, that Barnum, in behaving the way he would have wanted to behave, could have done the moral thing. So words like that–You’d need to talk about Dean’s language and, just as Sarah has done, put it in the context of our understanding of Dean’s language and its evolution over the course of the novel, so that does the work of getting your interpretation into the context of an entire interpretation of the novel. There is a dream there of a shared meaning-making moment that everyone will know. I didn’t quote anything from ,but I’m pointing to it in such a way that that would have several checks in the column in the margin, and basically what we do is we rack it up and we see whether for each novel you’ve made a number of specific points that add up to an argument. So, that’s a very, sort of, literary kind of version of the exam question. Let me show you something of a more, perhaps a cultural studies version. One is the rise of the mass market and that changes…Well, actually I would say three things. So, for people interested in raising their class status, and that was lots of people, coming into the educational system, higher education, for the first time, literature was very important. If you read the first few pages of one of his earlier novels, you get a fantastic image of this. And I love Roth for my own obscure and perverse reasons. I also have the length problem in that part of the period. That was the snobbery, and that made me upset ‘cause I thought well, that’s just a failure of openness as a reader, not to think about why it was so powerful, even if you don’t like it yourself. It was just amazing, the degree to which he put his writing pen at the service of another person and their story."
375,english,engl-291,lecture-2,"Professor Amy Hungerford continues her discussion of Richard Wright’s classic American autobiography, . Through a close analysis of key passages, she demonstrates an oscillation in the narrative between the socioeconomic deprivations and racial jeopardy confronting its characters, and the compensations to be found in sensual experience, the imagination, and in particular, the power of words. Dramatizing the editorial struggle evident in letters between Wright and Book-of-the-Month-Club-President Dorothy Canfield Fisher, Professor Hungerford shows the high stakes of Wright’s uncompromising portrait of America’s failed ideals at a time when those ideals are being tested during the Second World War.","I just want to recap what I talked about last time very briefly. So what I want to do today is look closely first at the selections from that I asked you to read and to look at those as a text and to ask ourselves what we can learn about what kind of story it is. So one thing that readers lost, when they lost the second half of this book, is the sense that maturing, the process of maturing, was more than just the process of leaving the South. Whenever I tried to sleep I would see huge, wobbly, white bags, like the full udders of cows, suspended from the ceiling above me. His mother, who gave him life, can take that life away from him. But that revision is also away from a sense that this jeopardy is represented by a racial face, the symbolic face of black oppression, the white face that is always cruelly set against the black boy of this account. He revises it away from that to the more generalized, fundamental, but also very personal figure of the mother and the maternal. We have this fear of the horrible white liquid, as if milk were going to drown him. There was the faint, cool kiss of sensuality when dew came to my cheeks and shins as I ran down the wet green garden paths in the early morning. There’s a lot you can say about these catalogs, and when I used to teach the whole of this text over a course of two days, I would spend a lot of time–and, if you want to, it’s worth and it repays the time that you could spend–rereading these and thinking about the exact language: for instance, here at the very top of page 8, when he talks about the “dreaming waters” of the Mississippi River. What you have there is a moment when the perception of the child becomes the perception of the world imbued with imagination. And so what I’m going to do is just now run through the next two or three scenes and talk about why they’re set next to each other. I don’t think we’re meant to understand that the young Richard, when he discovers that the Kate Adams is a dirty, little boat and not this romantic vision of a ship he had hoped for, that the young Richard thinks to himself, “This is because I am a poor, black boy growing up in the South.” He says:I had had my first triumph over my father. I had made him feel that if he whipped me for killing the kitten I would never give serious weight to his words again. And here I want to look at page–let’s see–page 79, actually first on 47, just in passing quickly. I learned about their tawdry dreams, their simple hopes, their home lives, their fear of feeling anything deeply, their sex problems, their husbands. There is a social analysis that he begins to be able to advance partly due to his reading in Marxism, in sociology. And in fact the question of emotion bears directly on his sense of what books are for. And this is remarkable for how different it is from someone like Nabokov or John Barth or many of our other writers on the syllabus:If I could fasten the mind of the reader upon words so firmly that he would forget words and be conscious only of his response, I felt that I would be in sight of knowing how to write narrative. I strove to master words, to make them disappear, to make them important by making them new, to make them melt into a rising spiral of emotional stimuli, each greater than the other, each feeding and reinforcing the other, and all ending in an emotional climax that would drench the reader with the sense of a new world. My belief in books had risen more out of a sense of desperation than from my abiding conviction of their ultimate value. Imagine that you are Richard Wright, and you’ve grown up with the life that he describes in this book."
376,english,engl-291,lecture-3,"Professor Amy Hungerford’s first lecture on Flannery O’Connor’s  addresses questions of faith and interpretation. She uses excerpts from O’Connor’s copious correspondence to introduce the critical framework of O’Connor’s Catholicism, but invites us to look beyond the question of redemption. What do characters see in this text, and what are they blind to? What do we see as readers, and how does methodology shape this vision?","We finished last time, and one of the big questions coming out of my discussion of that autobiography is: how do you manage the question of context in reading a novel or an autobiography–in reading any text? She was a Catholic, and she very much made her Catholicism at the center of all the things that she said about her fictional practice. Of course, Haze Motes is not an figure, but there are obvious resemblances. She expands a little bit on this sense of her Catholicism. These two quotations seem to me a kind of rubric under which we can start to think about what it means to read this novel, and what it means to read it in the light of the religious context that O’Connor herself, critics, marketers, have built up around her work. Somehow, something is wrong with Haze Motes’s eyes, something wrong with his sight, or rather there is something important about his sight that we’re going to have to unpack. What do we look at when we read this novel, and what do we see? He took the brake off and the car shot backwards because the man had left it in reverse. When he was thoroughly convinced, he saw that this was something he had always known. The misery he had was a longing for home. You can in some ways see religion and home as conflated. The Bible is a physical manifestation of the proximity of the spiritual and the material in this world. This is why he’s continually mistaken for a preacher, no matter what he does. The sky leaked all over all of it, and then it began to leak in to the car. The sky, the world above, is really bound up with the world below. Mrs. Wally B. Hitchcock, who was facing Motes in the section, said that she thought the early evening like this was the prettiest time of day, and she asked him if he didn’t think so too. The driver’s expression and his hand stayed exactly the way they were, as if he didn’t hear very well. These two characters are as if there is a wall between them, a wall of foam. I been here two months,” he said, “and I don’t know nobody. They walked on without saying anything until they got to the main street again. What I want to suggest to you is that, when we actually look at the sentences on the page, when we look at the words that O’Connor chose in the moments of the narration, we see something that becomes more complicated than the “Flannery O’Connor is a Catholic writer”; “Haze Motes is a Christian .” If we think about this, analogize it to how Haze looks, it’s a way of looking at O’Connor’s fiction that sees nothing but the theology behind it, that sees nothing but the Christian iconography. What do we miss?I’ve begun to point out a few things that I think we miss: the fragmentation of bodies. Is it in the same register of importance in our reading as some of these more theological, structural considerations that have been offered to us in her letters, in her preface, and in the very overt symbology of the landscape scenes, of these other scenes that I was reading to you today, in that image of the unhoused believer trying to find a home in an alien world?So, in my next lecture, what I’m going to do is pretty much contradict most of what I said today."
377,english,engl-291,lecture-4,"In this second lecture on Flannery O’Connor’s , Professor Amy Hungerford continues to offer several specific contexts in which to read and understand the novel. Having used O’Connor’s letters to delve into her theological commitments in the previous lecture, Professor Hungerford now explores the southern social context, particularly with respect to race and gender, and the New Critical writing program of which O’Connor was a product. Hungerford finally suggests that O’Connor’s writing illuminates the important–and perhaps undertheorized–link between the institutionalization of formal unity by the New Critics, and their strong religious influences.","I started last time, and actually my whole lecture existed under the rubric of, this quotation from Sabbath Lily Hawks, and I’m just going to read it to you again. “ And, just to remind you of that catalog, I just want to look at page 43 in your edition, 47 in mine. Remember when Haze and Enoch are in the middle of the park at the swimming pool. It’s as if they’re sneaking up behind her. But I would suggest, and actually Yaeger suggests this too, that the violence of southern culture goes way beyond just the violence of the culture of femininity, the culture of the southern woman. Lily herself is a child who is completely unloved by her father. So, children are deeply abused and neglected. This is the bottom of 230:“It’s day,” the thinner one, the cop, said, looking at the sky. “ So, these are the kinds of images that the Civil Rights movement really brought to light. But overt racism is there, too, and if you look on page 67 in your book–and this is on 71 in mine–you will see that O’Connor does not hesitate to use the word “nigger” in the dialog of her characters. This is just part of her representation of the place, part of her representation of these characters. Haze opened the door enough to be able to slam it. A howl arose that would have rended almost any heart. We’re certainly not meant to identify with him or to sympathize with him, but here you can’t help but thinking about someone getting their thumb smashed in a door. Haze drove about twenty feet and stopped the car and then began to back it. It’s very hard not to see it as a symbol. Sabbath Lily tells the story of wrestling with her identity as a bastard, and on 119 you get her account of her writing to the advice columnist Mary Brittle about the problem of being a bastard and what kind of sexual play is appropriate for a bastard, given the fact that the Bible says a bastard shall not enter the kingdom of heaven. But I have this personality that makes boys follow me. So, this is a moment when Sabbath tempts Haze back to belief, and Haze’s meditation on, or his wrestling with, the question in this chapter of whether a bastard can be in the Church without Christ. And so, this view of the artwork–probably you have experienced it if you’ve taken other English classes, and in fact I’ve been producing it for you in my readings–this mode of reading looks for those tropes that unify a work. I would suggest – and this is the third kind of context I want to give you today – that the three I’ve given you–O’Connor’s letters, her theological commitments, southern context, southern social context, the New Critical writing program, the institutionalization of modernism–these things are not in fact separable from one another."
378,english,engl-291,lecture-5,"Professor Amy Hungerford introduces the first of three lectures on Nabokov’s  by surveying students’ reactions to the novel, highlighting the conflicting emotions readers feel, enjoying Nabokov’s virtuosic style, but being repelled by the violence of his subject matter. Nabokov’s childhood in tsarist Russia provides some foundation for his interest in memory, imagination, and language. Finally, Professor Hungerford shows how Nabokov, through the voice of his protagonist Humbert, in his own voice in the epilogue, and in the voice of “John Ray, Jr.” in the foreword, preempts moral judgments in a novel that celebrates the power of the imagination and the seductive thrill of language.","Last time I finished up my lectures on by trying to draw together three different ways of reading the novel into one interpretative framework, and what I ultimately argued was that the New Critical formal unity of the novel that is epitomized, I think (in a somewhat, perhaps, heavy-handed way), in Chapter 7 of the novel–that’s book-ended by the symbol of the blinding white cloud–that it’s that unity, in a sense, that replaces the bodily unities that are always blown apart in O’Connor’s fiction. That’s how Amos describes the prose style of So, I want you to keep that image in your mind. Would you like to sit down to dinner with Humbert? ( I actually want to change that around, if I might, and play with that, because that’s a really useful image for us: “takes the mask off literature and reminds us how we come to be sympathetic or how we come to think something.” In a certain way, I would want to flip your image around. So, before I get in to that, let me just give you some background. And his father was a democrat but not a Bolshevik; so, he was anti-czarist, but he was not a Bolshevik. His parents were very much absent from his growing-up life. And you can see the marks in Conrad’s fiction of his having learned English and then, it comes across as a sort of clotted style in Conrad. And I would suggest to you that we can connect this with Humbert’s moment of wondering what happens to the little girls whose images he is excited by. This is on page 21, the beginning of chapter 6:I have often wondered what became of those nymphets later in this wrought-iron world of criss-cross cause and effect. If, however, for this paradoxical prude’s comfort, an editor attempted to dilute or omit scenes that a certain type of mind might call aphrodisiac [And then he makes reference to the court case in which  was ruled not to be obscene in 1933], one would have to forego the publication of altogether, since those very scenes that one might ineptly accuse of sensuous existence of their own are the most strictly functional ones in the development of a tragic tale tending unswervingly to nothing less than a moral apotheosis. It is, of course, Dr. “White Blackman,” and it’s referring to the Kinsey Report, the famous Kinsey Report on the sexual habits of Americans. As a work of art it transcends its expiatory aspects, and still more important to us than scientific significance and literary worth is the ethical impact the book should have on the serious reader. You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style."
379,english,engl-291,lecture-6,"In this guest lecture, Teaching Fellow Andrew Goldstone provides us with some key concepts for understanding Modernism and Nabokov’s relation in particular to his literary forebears T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, and Marcel Proust. Positing the “knight’s move” as a description of Nabokov’s characteristically indirect, evasive style, Goldstone argues that Nabokov’s parodies of Modernist form in fact reveal his deep commitment to some of the same aesthetic principles. While the knight’s move often indicates a playful attitude towards tradition, it also betrays a traumatic rupture with the past, reflecting a sense of exile that links Nabokov’s art with the violence of ’s protagonist, Humbert.","Today it is my very great privilege and pleasure to introduce Andrew Goldstone, a TF in this course. I’m going to bracket the ethical question, leave that for Monday’s lecture, and the way I want to approach this question of the style in the novel and the question of aestheticism is by placing Nabokov in the context of literary modernism. What in Eliot is crisis, in Nabokov is just a joke. So, now, here’s just a list for you: eight features of literary modernism that are all important to Nabokov. Unlike any other piece, it skips over pieces in the way. So the knight, far from going on a straight course, surprises you. Nabokov, in 1966 he said this: “The greatest masterpieces of twentieth-century prose”–this is convenient; take this down–“are, in this order: Joyce’s , Kafka’s “–that is, –“Bely’s ,” a pretty obscure Russian avant-garde novel, “and the first half of Proust’s fairy tale, ” I’m not sure the fairy tale should remind you of that first meeting between Humbert and Lolita that we looked at on Monday, described in fairy tale terms. Just a suggestion: look on page 20, still in Humbert’s early life, near the bottom:It happened for instance that from my balcony I would notice a lighted window across the street and what looked like a nymphet in the act of undressing before a co-operative mirror. And, with Eliot, I read the Nabokovian version first. And so, this is a kind of forecast of what will happen later on. That refers to Mary Rose Hamilton; Haze, Dolores; Hanek, Rosaline. I want to think a little bit more about this idea of a McFate. So, the artificial has taken the place of the real here, and this novel really reminds you of that all the time. Now, as I come to my last section here, what I want to suggest is that this kind of transformation of arbitrary, real fated events into conspicuously artificial tricks (which you might think of a knight’s move on the real: fate; McFate) is a response in particular to exile, in particular to Nabokov’s condition of exile. Nothing is initially known to make sense; everything has to be figured out and reinvented. But it has a payoff, kind of, a payoff which is the possibility precisely of inventing, and this is visible everywhere in this book. So, so far the American landscape is already a work of art, already part of a European memory. So, a European artist actually appears again there, with Claude Lorrain, but kind of made strange: given that knight’s move, given a new twist. In other words, that the aesthetic discovery of English is something that just kind of fits comfortably into this prejudice of the dull suburban American."
380,english,engl-291,lecture-7,"In the last of three lectures on , Professor Amy Hungerford discusses the broader context of Nabokov’s relation to his novel: both the debate it inspires surrounding censorship and artistic originality, and the concern it evokes in him about the work of art’s distillation of the living world or word. Hungerford masterfully draws connections between Nabokov’s interest in lepidoptery–butterfly collecting–with his evident fear that the printed word become lapidary, or stone-like. Just as we can no longer appreciate the beauty of a butterfly’s motion, once it has been pinned down, so too might living language fall victim to a kind of violence on the page, a formal equivalent to the thematic violence that increases as the novel progresses.",": I want to start my lecture today looking back to that handout I gave you–but didn’t give you a discussion of–a couple of days ago, from that essay   that I quoted at the very beginning of class this term. He also gives us, if you notice, his little secret map of ,or so it seems as it’s presented to us, his secret map of the scenes that delight him in his own novel, and this is on 316:I find it [] to be a delightful presence now that it quietly hangs about the house like a summer day which one knows to be bright behind the haze. Today, I’m going to pick up on some of those other scenes that he mentions as his secret points of delight in the novel. Now, the most conspicuous things that happen are an increase in the violence of the novel. He hits her; he pushes her; he rapes her repeatedly. We see more of those scenes in the second half of the novel. It’s not just, sort of, physical comedy translated into prose, but there are a host of other moments in the novel where pushing and pulling figure: darkly in one of the rape scenes (he pushes her in to a room); less darkly at the drugstore (the soda jerk pulling on the levers of the dispenser).“Look out!” And Humbert reflects that her work in the play has trained her into certain affectations. Some old woman, Claire something I guess. This is the realm of that mountain of imagination that I was showing you in the passage from This is Humbert’s meditation on looking at a map and seeing a range in which imagination can have pure play. That pose–the pose of tennis service, the raised foot–it’s the same pose she uses to seduce him in that scene I just read after their fight: “I feel sort of romantic tonight.” And I want to suggest that the threat to this kind of play is parallel to the threat to children. The threat to children in the novel multiplies. On 223 we find out that Mona, Lolita’s friend from the play, her baby sibling–we’re not told whether it’s a boy or girl–dies, and we see it in one of those parentheticals, 223. And the elf-like image is something that he applies to Lolita over and over. It is nature in its aesthetic form as imitation of itself, life as an imitation of life. And I want to suggest to you that the aquamarine has an even darker personal significance to him. I think that’s one of the places where Nabokov is."
381,english,engl-291,lecture-8,"Professor Amy Hungerford’s lecture on Kerouac’s  begins by contrasting the Beats’ ambition for language’s direct relation to lived experience with a Modernist sense of difficulty and mediation. She goes on to discuss the ways that desire structures the novel, though not in the ways that we might immediately expect. The very blatant pursuit of sex with women in the novel, for example, obscures the more significant desire for connection among men, particularly the narrator Sal’s love for Dean Moriarty. The apparent desire for the freedom of the open road, too, Hungerford argues, exists in a necessary conjunction with the idealized comforts of a certain middle-class American domesticity, signaled by the repeated appearance of pie.",": So, today we find ourselves in a very different novelistic world than we’ve been in for the last week and a half: . You’re not going to get that in the Beats. In a certain way, this is not a rejection of modernism and its desire for the autonomous work of art, because partly, as I’ve shown, the desire for the autonomous work of art shades into the desire to replicate life. I noticed that several of you were smiling, in a way, as I read, that suggested you were embarrassed by the performance. Try never to get drunk outside your own house. Write what you want bottomless from bottom of the mind. Old Bull Lee is William Burroughs, and his wife, Jane, Jane Lee. Then news came that Dean was out of reform school and was coming to New York for the first time; also there was talk that he had just married a girl called Marylou. ”So, this is not yet that idealized speech that Kerouac is dreaming of when he writes the list of Essentials for Spontaneous Prose. In other versions he says that Dean got up and was naked, not that he was in his shorts. And it’s not just between the men and the women. But that aesthetic image of Dean is all bound up in these negotiations. So, all of that is very palpable, and Sal’s own desire for Dean is sublimated in those scenes, but it’s everywhere at the level of the language. But I would suggest to you that home is absolutely crucial to the production of this desire. It was getting better as I got deeper in to Iowa, the pie bigger, the ice cream richer. When I got home I ate everything in the icebox. So, when we talk about desire for something–“we’ve got to go someplace, find something–the very vagueness of that desire is connected with the basic hungers of the body for sex, for food, for sleep even. They began with an abstract thought, discussed it, reminded each other of another abstract point forgotten in the rush of events. So, it has a quality that is different from Humbert’s elaborate world view through which we see or don’t see Lolita. If you look on 107-108, again at the very end of the section: “I had my home to go to, my place to lay my head down and figure the losses and figure the gain that I knew was in there somewhere too.”"
382,english,engl-291,lecture-9,"In this second lecture on , Professor Hungerford addresses some of the obstacles and failures to the novel’s high ambitions for achieving American community through an immediacy of communication. Sal Paradise’s desire to cross racial boundaries, for example, seems ultimately more exploitative than expansive; Dean’s exuberant language of “Yes!” and “Wow!” devolves into meaningless gibberish. And yet the novel’s mystical vision of something called “America” persists, a cultural icon that continues to engage the interest of readers, scholars, and artists. Among these latter is the digital art collaborative Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries, with whose online work DAKOTA Hungerford concludes the class.","I’ve put two quotations on the board for your consideration. So, I put these up here to sort of sit in the background of what I’m going to talk to you about today about the ultimate payoff for Kerouac’s effort and the Beats’ effort, more generally, to imagine a language that is the adequate analog to experience, a language that is itself a kind of experience, and further, that is an ecstatic, mystical kind of experience. Last time, in addition to introducing that idea of language to you, I conducted a reading of the first part of the novel where I suggested that Kerouac tells a story that is not so much about the escape from an American consumer culture of the postwar period as it is a story about the absolute immersion in a culture of consumption. This is, remember, when he’s hitched a ride in this truck, and it’s a truck bed full of men who have hitched rides. How many people can we imagine who might fit that description? So, this is just one of the ways that Sal longs to assimilate them to himself. I wanted to go back and leer at my strange Dickensian mother in the hash joint. It’s Dickens in part, that stereotype of old London, of the urban working class, but it’s not just Dickens. Dean has gone off with Camille; Marylou is off somewhere else; he’s starved; he doesn’t have any place to go. As of yore, I looked everywhere for the sad and fabled tinsmith of my mind. And then he makes some comments about how, well, he could never pick cotton fast enough; he’s just not able to do it as black men are. So that oneness looks something like the Buddhism that Kerouac studied for a time; it looks like something more than the effort for Sal just to be something exotic. There’s actually a wonderful episode in that is nearly a carbon copy of what you’ll see later in ,where Dean looks down on Salt Lake City at night, and he looks at the pattern of the lights down below him. And I can point you to some of these pages. In that moment Sal supplies the answer for why Dean came, “never knew why he had come anyway,” and then Sal supplies “except to see me,” and his own pain and tears are routed through Laura. This is how Dean talks at the very end:He couldn’t talk anymore. You understand that it is, or might be, but listen.” So, Viking has in their backlist, so they can make new copies. But what else they do, is they lard it with scholarly articles. And this is one of them from 2002 called and I think you will see immediately how and why it is related to It’s also related to Ezra Pound’s ,but I’m not going to burden you with that right now."
383,english,engl-300,lecture-10,"In this lecture on Derrida and the origins of deconstruction, Professor Paul Fry explores two central Derridian works: “Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of Human Sciences” and “Différance.” Derrida’s critique of structuralism and semiotics, particularly the work of Levi-Strauss and Saussure, is articulated. Deconstruction’s central assertions that language is by nature arbitrary and that meaning is indeterminate are examined. Key concepts, such as the nature of the text, discourse, , and supplementarity are explored.","So anyway, to get launched on today’s topic, obviously we confront one of the more formidable figures on our syllabus, a person who recently passed away and who in his last years and into the present has had a kind of second life as a person who in his later work didn’t at all repudiate his earlier thoughts or indeed his earlier style, but nevertheless did begin to apply central aspects of his thinking to ethical and political issues. There is a self-consciousness in the thinking about structure that we find in many places in Levi-Strauss that Derrida freely acknowledges in his essay. He influenced a great many people whose work is still current throughout the United States and elsewhere. The idea that there was what was called by one critic a “hermeneutical mafia” at Yale arose largely from the presence of Derrida together with our own Paul de Man and, more loosely connected with them, Geoffrey Hartman and Harold Bloom–and also a scholar named J. Hillis Miller, whose departure for the University of California, Irvine resulted also in Derrida’s decision to go there and be with Miller rather than to continue to stay here. I placed a jar in Tennessee,And round it was, upon a hill."
384,english,engl-300,lecture-11,"In this second lecture on deconstruction, Professor Paul Fry concludes his consideration of Derrida and begins to explore the work of Paul de Man. Derrida’s affinity for and departure from Levi-Strauss’s distinction between nature and culture are outlined. De Man’s relationship with Derrida, their similarities and differences–particularly de Man’s insistence on “self-deconstruction” and his reliance on Jakobson–are discussed. The difference between rhetoric and grammar, particularly the rhetoricization of grammar and the grammaticization of rhetoric, is elucidated through de Man’s own examples taken from “All in the Family,” Yeats’s “Among School Children,” and the novels of Proust.","I’d like to start with a little more discussion of Derrida before we turn to de Man. What he quotes from Levi-Strauss would seem, on the face of it, to have exactly the same kinds of reservation and hesitation about the emergence or birth of language that Derrida himself has. Nature is a meaningless concept just like the lack of meaning within nature, where there’s no culture until culture comes along and says, “Oh, not so much there is nature, but I’m terribly unhappy because before I came along, there was nature.” You can’t have a notion of “raw” until you have the notion of “cooked.” As you’ll see in de Man, there is an irreducible tension between the rhetorical sense of this word, which claims metaphoricity, and the grammatical sense of this word, which makes no such claim but is simply the establishment of predication in a sentence. It began to infiltrate other disciplines and was in general a high-spirited horse for that certain period of time. Now all of this is a matter of record and I suppose needs to be paused over a little bit. So in the second passage on your sheet to which I’ll return in the end, we find de Man saying, “Literary theory can be said to come into being when”–that is de Man’s version of the event, and he agrees with Derrida in saying, “Well, sure God came into being; man came into being; consciousness came into being. De Man says:It is easy enough to see that this apparent glorification of the critic-philosopher in the name of truth is in fact a glorification of the poet as the primary source of this truth…Now he does not mean, as Freud, for example, meant in saying, “The poets came before me and the poets knew everything I knew before I knew it.” That is the way in which de Man wants to think about the relationship precisely between literature and other forms of speech. The structural moment of concentration on the code for its own sake cannot be avoided, and literature necessarily breeds its own formalism. Literature, unlike everyday language, begins on the far side of this knowledge. It is the only form of knowledge free from the fallacy of unmediated expression–in other words, free from the fallacy that when I say “It is raining,” I mean I’m a meteorologist and I mean it is raining. He’s saying they’re doing great work but they forget this one little thing: you cannot reconcile rhetoric and grammar. Proust I don’t have time for, but it’s a marvelous reading of that wonderful passage in which–remember that he’s set it up at the beginning of the essay with a kind of wonderful, cunning sort of sense of structure by talking about the grandmother in Proust who’s always driving Marcel out into the garden because she can’t stand the interiority of his reading. By the way, I’m going to leave also to your sections the strange confusion that ensues in taking a rhetorical device, metonymy, and making it synonymous with grammar on the axis of combination. There is this wonderful overarching voice that unifies everything after all."
385,english,engl-300,lecture-12,"In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry turns his attention to the relationship between authorship and the psyche. Freud’s meditations on the fundamental drives governing human behavior are read through the lens of literary critic Peter Brooks. The origins of Freud’s work on the “pleasure principle” and his subsequent revision of it are charted, and the immediate and constant influence of Freudian thought on literary production is asserted. Brooks’ contributions to literary theory are explored: particularly the coupling of multiple Freudian principles, including the pleasure principle and the death wish, and their application to narrative structures. At the lecture’s conclusion, the professor returns to the children’s story, , to suggest the universality of Brooks’s argument.","Well, now today is obviously a kind of watershed or transition in our syllabus. So this he gets from Freud, and he also gets, as I’ve already suggested, the methodological idea that one can think of the machinations of a text in terms of the distinction that Freud makes–not in ,but in  in the passages that you read for today’s assignment taken from that book, about the dream work. Condensation, in other words, is metaphorical in its nature, and displacement is metonymic in its nature. Brooks is not going around looking for Oedipus complexes and phallic symbols. Brooks is, as I hope you can see, interested in very different aspects of the Freudian text, and he says as much at the end of essay on page 1171 in the right-hand column where he says:… –as has usually been the case–a study of the psychogenesis of the text (the author’s unconscious), the dynamics of literary response (the reader’s unconscious), or the occult motivations of the characters (postulating an “unconscious” for them).In other words, Brooks is not interested in developing a theory of the author or a theory of character. Now I don’t think he really means to be dismissive of Freudian criticism. I think he’s really just telling us that he’s doing something different from that. I would remind you in passing that although we don’t pause over traditional Freudian criticism in this course, it can indeed be extremely interesting: just for example, Freud’s disciple, Ernest Jones, wrote an influential study of Shakespeare’s in which he showed famously that Hamlet has an Oedipus complex. Plainly, Freudian criticism with these sorts of preoccupations is widespread, continues sometimes to appear, and cannot simply be discounted or ignored as an influence in the development of thinking about literature or of the possibilities of thinking about literature. In these ways–and it remains to see whether, or to what extent, these ways are cooperative–Brooks understands the structure, the delay, the arabesque, or postponement of the end one finds in the text to involve a kind of coexistence of the sort that I have been talking about between relations to the possibility through desire of reducing excitation, being excited, and reducing excitation. In fact, so much of what we read in fiction is distinctly unpleasurable. They’re falling in love with the wrong person. Now quickly, as to the plot: desire emerges or begins as the narratable. Now I want to turn to as an instance of the way in which reading for the plot can take place. I cannot help you,” says Neato the Car. “"
386,english,engl-300,lecture-13,"In this lecture on psychoanalytic criticism, Professor Paul Fry explores the work of Jacques Lacan. Lacan’s interest in Freud and distaste for post-Freudian “ego psychologists” are briefly mentioned, and his clinical work on “the mirror stage” is discussed in depth. The relationship in Lacanian thought, between metaphor and metonymy is explored through the image of the . The correlation between language and the unconscious, and the distinction between desire and need, are also explained, with reference to Hugo’s “Boaz Asleep.”","I can infer, I think, from looking around the room that there is either post-paper depression at work or that having written the paper, you scarcely had time to read a fifteen-page labyrinthine essay by Lacan. It’s something I am going to want to spend a lot of time with in the long run today. So this, too, one finds in desire in Lacan. The distinction is often put–and when you read Slavoj Žižek next week–who makes a much more central point of this, it’s often put as the distinction between the “big other”–  and later on we’ll talk about why it’s big–the “big other,” which one can never appropriate as an object of desire because it is perpetually and always elusive, and the “,” the little object of desire, which is not really an object of desire at all but is available to satisfy need. Now the obvious gloss here, I think, is the Rolling Stones. It’s somebody who begins as Lacan does–and this is something we’ll want to come back to–somebody who begins with Freud’s famous proposition, “Wo es war soll ich sein”: “Where it was, there I should be.” ”It does have something to do with Lacan’s revision of Freud in saying that the object of lack that perpetually motivates desire, the desire for what one lacks, is not at all physical. In other words, it is, despite being obviously an incredibly different kind of thing, nevertheless. In the beginning was the letter, which disseminates consciousness through the signifying system that it makes available. Lacan shares a structuralist understanding of how the unconscious discourses. There is, in any case, in Lacan’s anecdote the wonderful existence of the railroad tracks, which for him constitutes the bar: that is to say, that owing to the nature of language, owing to the arbitrary relation of the signifier to the signified, the little boy and little girl–who are wonderful characters right out of Nabokov’s –I don’t know if any of you know that novel, but the little boy is sort of a little genius, obviously Lacan, but his sister is even smarter than he is. “ Lacan is very ingenious in, I think, convincingly showing us how it is that we get from one signifier to another: in other words, how what he calls the chain of the signifier works. It is the awareness of the lack of an object of desire expressed in a displaced manner–that is to say, expressed in a manner which is not, however, completely obfuscatory of the lack of the object of desire, just sort of caught up in my endless babbling; but rather is that moment of pause in which there is a gathering together of signifiers and, ultimately, a substitution of one signifier for another in such a way that one says, “Aha. So the line has both a metonymic reading and a metaphoric reading. I cannot be present to myself because what is present is the way in which my self comes into being in discourse which cannot identify me. That’s what’s so wonderful and amazing about the essay by Žižek you’ll be reading for next week called “Courtly Love,” which I love and which headlines, which features readings of a series of films in which the Lacanian distinction between the impossibility ever of achieving the Big Other–by the way, there are times in various kinds of fictional plots in which you can actually have the object of desire, but what always happens in plots like that is that the unconscious, the psyche, finds ways of rejecting it."
387,english,engl-300,lecture-14,"In this lecture on the psyche in literary theory, Professor Paul Fry explores the work of T. S. Eliot and Harold Bloom, specifically their studies of tradition and individualism. Related and divergent perspectives on tradition, innovation, conservatism, and self-effacement are traced throughout Eliot’s “Tradition and the Individual Talent” and Bloom’s “A Meditation upon Priority.” Particular emphasis is placed on the process by which poets struggle with the literary legacies of their precursors. The relationship of Bloom’s thinking, in particular, to Freud’s Oedipus complex is duly noted. The lecture draws heavily from the works of Pope, Borges, Joyce, Homer, Wordsworth, Longinus, and Milton.","So I’ll tell you a little bit about Harold Bloom’s career later in the lecture. First we have logo genesis, the production of literature by language. Plato and Aristotle agree that art, poetry, is an imitation. Homer imitated nature, but then along comes Virgil–in this same period, by the way, when rhetorical theories were redefining imitation as the imitation of verbal models–along comes Virgil and he says, “I’m going to write my own national epic and you know what, I’ll just sit down and write it.”"
388,english,engl-300,lecture-15,"In this lecture on the postmodern psyche, Professor Paul Fry explores the work of Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari and Slavoj Žižek. The notion of the “postmodern” is defined through the use of examples in the visual arts and architecture. Deleuze and Guattari’s theory of “rhizomatic” thinking and their intellectual debts are elucidated. Žižek’s film criticism, focused on the relation between desire and need, is explored in connection with Lacan.","So today we’re still focused on individual consciousness. “ That is to say, in one way or another we are to understand their argument about the way in which the psyche functions as having political implications. Guattari is an important colleague and ally. In any case, so we’ll be examining the Deleuzian rhizome a little bit more closely, but in the meantime, as to its political implications–and we are moving closer to the political as we begin to think about figures of this kind–they’re really on the admission of both of them somewhat ambiguous. Actually, I think that’s not quite true, but at the same time the kind of high-energy, too-caffeinated feeling that you get from the prose of both is something that might give you pause and make you wonder: well, just what moment does this belong to?The answer is important and, in a way, obvious. But, in short, to concretize this idea of the problematic relationship between part and whole in a different way, why are we so confident about what we see?As most of you know, I’m sure, philosophical thinking tends to be tyrannized by metaphors of vision. Now this is a weird term to choose because it’s not at all anti-humanistic. Now you could say that this is something actually anticipated also by Lacan. Whatever frustrations Deleuze’s essay puts in your path, I think probably in the long run you’re pretty clear on what a rhizome is, but if there is any lingering doubt just think about the flu. It’s a perfect example of–to use another instance from Deleuze–the relationship between the wasp and the orchid. One is what he calls the “root book,” the traditional classical book which presents to you a theme: “I am going to write about so-and-so, and I’m going to do so systematically, one thing at a time in a series of chapters.” That is an obscure, not just a distant but an  object of desire. Of course, the premise of her inaccessibility is what drives the plot. Now I think that it’s interesting to think about the relationship between the element of detour and delay, as Žižek implies it, in understanding narrative and what Peter Brooks is talking about. Poor Hyacinth Robinson strikes out on both counts in rather completely parallel ways. At the bottom right-hand column, page 1193, Žižek says:… erhaps, in courtly love itself, the long-awaited moment of highest fulfillment, when the Lady renders, mercy, to her servant is not the Lady’s surrender, her consent to the sexual act, nor some mysterious rite of initiation, but simply a sign of love on the part of the Lady, the “miracle” that the Object answered, stretching its hand out towards the supplicant. In the foreground of the painting, notorious to art historians, there is this thing. We can find a way of placing formally absolutely everything in fiction. I hope that this somewhat rapid-fire survey of some key ideas in these texts are helpful."
389,english,engl-300,lecture-16,"In this first lecture on the theory of literature in social contexts, Professor Paul Fry examines the work of Mikhail Bakhtin and Hans Robert Jauss. The relation of their writing to formalist theory and the work of Barthes and Foucault is articulated. The dimensions of Bakhtin’s heteroglossia, along with the idea of common language, are explored in detail through a close reading of the first sentence of Jane Austin’s . Jauss’s study of the history of reception is explicated with reference to Borges’s “Pierre Menard, Author of the ” and the Broadway revival of .","So we arrive at our turn to sociogenesis. So we begin now to think of language still, and the relationship between language and speech, but now it’s not a language abstracted from reality; it’s a language which, precisely,  within reality and as a matter of social exchange and social interaction. It is that which we have to continue to think about as we consider how a style is generated. So this would suggest, I think–this idea of a style as a composite of speech sedimentations–this idea would suggest that possibly there isn’t a voice, that to speak of an authorial voice would be a very difficult matter and might lead us to ask, “Does this move the idea that the sociolect speaks through the idiolect, the idea that the language of everyone is, in fact, the language that speaks my speech, my peculiar individual speech–does this once again bring us face to face with that dreary topic, the death of the author?” So this is not, though it may seem to be in certain respects, a question of the death of the author as provoked by, let’s say, Foucault or Roland Barthes at the beginning of the semester. Everything that we’ve been saying so far can be seen to work in a variety of novels. Over against that, you get the polyglossal, the rich multiplicity of voice in the novel. As I say, I think that the generic contrast is somewhat oversimplified because nothing is easier and more profitable than to read both epic and lyric as manifestations of heteroglossia. In any case, the basic idea, however, is I think extraordinarily rich and important, and I thought we could try it out by taking a look for a moment at the first sentence of which I’m sure most of you know  words, it’s in everybody’s mouth–and something like authorial reflection, or what he elsewhere calls “internally persuasive discourse. In a way, the subtle pun in the word “want,” which means both “to desire” and “to lack”–well, if I lack something, I don’t necessarily desire it. It has passed through life changes, and these life changes have to be understood at each successive stage in terms of the three moments of hermeneutic grasp, as described by Gadamer in the historical section of The distinction between , , and –understanding, interpretation, and application–that Jauss talks about at the beginning of his essay actually goes back to the eighteenth century. A text enters historical circulation and remains before the gaze of successive audiences in history because it has been received aesthetically. It also involves changing semantic possibilities or, if you will, changing possibilities for and of significance–what does the text mean for me now?–but understood again not just as something that matters for me, but has successively mattered for successive generations of readers in between."
390,english,engl-300,lecture-17,"This first lecture on social theories of art and artistic production examines the Frankfurt School. The theoretical writings of Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin are explored in historical and political contexts, including Marxism, socialist realism, and late capitalism. The concept of mechanical reproduction, specifically the relationship between labor and art, is explained at some length. Adorno’s opposition to this argument, and his own position, are explained. The lecture concludes with a discussion of Benjamin’s perspective on the use of distraction and shock in the process of aesthetic revelation.","As we get into social perspectives on literature and art, you may ask yourself out of idle curiosity, or perhaps even peevishly, “Why Marx? There  other ways of effecting a social criticism of literature and art. What you want to do is understand the world realistically but not tendentiously–that is to say, not from an open point of view. It’s partly an attack on what Lukacs took to be the sort of narcissistic inwardness of High Modernism, particularly Joyce and Proust. So those are the forms of realism that I think are most often identified with Marxist criticism and its possibilities; but as a matter of fact, probably the most dynamic criticism since Lukacs of the twentieth century has recognized that realism is something that, after all, from a Marxist perspective can easily be shown to have been commandeered by the bourgeoisie. I want to pause over them because I think Adorno’s essay–while perhaps a little quixotic, because after all, who ever could profit from a concept of this kind?–Adorno’s essay is nevertheless rather brilliant in its distinction between the totality, or wholeness, that’s offered to you by artistic form and the mere totalization or totalitarianism that’s offered to you by modern hegemonic forms of government–whether truly totalitarian or insidiously totalitarian like, for example, the “culture industry” to which he devotes the essay that you’ve read. So this is what Adorno says in these two passages. Instead they suspend the critique which the successful aesthetic totality exerts against the flawed one of society. Of course, I’m getting ahead of myself, because that’s precisely what Adorno says in opposition to him, but in the meantime that was the situation of Benjamin in the 1930s. Adorno, in the meantime, had gone to the United States. He takes this to be the effect, the result, of the pervasive, oppressive thumb of the culture industry, so that our very eccentricities, our very quirks and little originalities, all of them are assessed carefully by the culture industry. What he means by this is that the spectator sees the object, sees whatever the field in question is, from the perspective of the mode of production–that is to say, the spectator participates by joining the  of production. Well, the spectator is, in a certain sense, then, a . He says, “The camera introduces us to unconscious optics just as does psychoanalysis to unconscious impulses.” It’s not, perhaps, so much a notion of privileging what the camera sees as real over against what I see. Maybe I’ll come back to that briefly before launching into Jameson on Thursday."
391,english,engl-300,lecture-18,"In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry explores Fredric Jameson’s seminal work, , as an outcropping of Marxist literary criticism and structural theory. Texts such as Shelley’s “Ode to the West Wind” and Shakespeare’s seventy-third sonnet are examined in the context of Jameson’s three horizons of underlying interpretive frameworks–the political, the social, and the historical, each carefully explained. The extent to which those frameworks permeate individual thought is addressed in a discussion of Jameson’s concept of the “ideologeme.” The theorist’s work is juxtaposed with the writings of Bakhtin and Levi-Strauss. The lecture concludes by revisiting the children’s story , upon which Jameson’s theory of literature is mapped.","Well, I’d like to begin by pointing out that the first name of Fredric Jameson is spelled F-r-e-d-r-i-c. The reason I point that out is that most scholars don’t seem to be able to grasp that simple fact and that references to him, which are rife in the critical literature, perhaps one-third of the time spell his first name wrong. So Jameson says, on the second passage on your sheet:Let Scott, Balzac and Dreiser serve as the  has a paradoxically liberating effect on the registers of the text and releases a set of heterogeneous historical perspectives: the past for Scott, the future for Balzac, and the process of commodification for Dreiser–normally felt to be inconsistent with a focus on the historical present. Well, it’s what Jameson, borrowing from Kenneth Burke, calls “the symbolic act.” In other words, it can be sort of tragic to hit the Lotto, as many stories of that kind have made clear to us. It is a thumbing of the nose at hegemony. Jameson lists them in his text, and we’ll come back to them and we’ll read that listing and we’ll think about those terms; but Jameson gives an excellent example of the way in which, in the latter part of the eighteenth century, the Enlightenment began to be the dominant form of expression of an emergent mercantile, successfully capitalist bourgeoisie. Levi-Strauss asks both in and again in :why the excessive complexity of these paintings? Jameson doesn’t talk about it because it’s not in any obvious and immediate way a political problem or a problem susceptible of Marxist analysis. The very thing against which one is warned is the thing that one rushes to embrace and so on. All of that is simply a matter of historical fact, but in literary analysis you begin to think of it in more formal terms, and you see, for example, the very choice of verse form–and I’m taking as an example Shelley’s famous poem “The Ode to the West Wind”–you see the very choice of verse form as an instance of what Jameson calls “the ideology of form” that can be understood in terms of the conflict of modes of production. So these exemplify, in various ways, what can be done with these three levels. The worker is always going to laugh at the boss behind his back. This is the way it is; this is the way it will always be. Think of Adorno and his incredible gloom about the culture industry. Before then, you got maybe one person standing on a rafter with a rope kind of pulling but everybody else is down on the ground pushing; and so the relationship between pushing and pulling in the story is a crucially important one which suggests the overlap of older and newer modes of production, all of which can be resolved at Jameson’s third or historical level of analysis."
392,english,engl-300,lecture-19,"In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry examines the work of two seminal New Historicists, Stephen Greenblatt and Jerome McGann. The origins of New Historicism in Early Modern literary studies are explored, and New Historicism’s common strategies, preferred evidence, and literary sites are explored. Greenblatt’s reliance on Foucault is juxtaposed with McGann’s use of Bakhtin. The lecture concludes with an extensive consideration of the project of editing of Keats’s poetry in light of New Historicist concerns.","So today we turn to a mode of doing literary criticism which was extraordinarily widespread beginning in the late seventies and into the eighties, called the New Historicism. So, as I say, it was in a polemical atmosphere and at a moment of widespread self-doubt in the academic literary profession that the New Historicism came into its own–a response, as I say, to the isolation of the text by certain techniques and approaches to it. Now very quickly: the method of New Historical analysis fell into a pattern, a very engaging one, one that’s wonderfully exemplified by the brief introduction of Greenblatt that I have asked you to read: a pattern of beginning with an anecdote, often rather far afield, at least apparently rather far afield, from the literary issues that are eventually turned to in the argument of a given essay. So as I said, Foucault is the crucial antecedent and of course, when it’s a question of Foucault, literature as we want to conceive of it–perhaps generically or as a particular kind of utterance as opposed to other kinds–does tend to collapse back into the broader or more general notion of discourse, because it’s by means of discourse that power circulates knowledge. Once again, despite the fact that New Historicism wants to return us to the real world, it nevertheless acknowledges that that return is language bound. That’s why for the New Historicist–and by this means, I’ll turn in a moment to the marvelous anecdote with which Greenblatt begins the brief essay that I’ve asked you to read–that’s why the New Historicist lays such intense emphasis on the idea that the relationship between discourse–call it literature if you like, you might as well–and history is reciprocal. History is an important way of understanding the valency of certain kinds of utterance at certain times. Literature, especially when escaped from its conventional confines, becomes a very, very dangerous  positive influence, depending on your point of view on the course of history. Wilson doesn’t acknowledge this because his view of the relationship between history and literature is only that history influences literature, not that the influence can be reciprocal. This is not the case, said Gadamer, remember. So if one is to criticize, again it’s not a question of criticizing his basic pronouncements. in the 1848 version–and all of its other variants, the “kisses four” and so on–the 1848 version is a kind of unselfconscious–in McGann’s view–romance subscribing to certain medieval ideas about women, simultaneously putting them on a pedestal and fearing, at the same time, that they’re invested with a kind of black magic which destroys the souls and dissipates the sap of deserving young gentlemen: all of this is ideologically programmed, according to McGann, in the 1848 version. For better or worse, whatever we think of that ideologically, it is about, if the title is right, the kind of woman who is evoked in the 1848 version, as opposed to the kind of woman who is evoked in the 1820 version. That is to say, Keats can’t possibly have thought in that demeaning way about women. That’s the challenge, of course, of working with historical circumstances. We see things, in other words, from the point of view of the apparatus. All of this, according to the prescription of ,is actually happening."
393,english,engl-300,lecture-1,"In this first lecture, Professor Paul Fry explores the course’s title in three parts. The relationship between theory and philosophy, the question of what literature is and does, and what constitutes an introduction are interrogated. The professor then situates the emergence of literary theory in the history of modern criticism and, through an analysis of major thinkers such as Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, provides antecedents for twentieth-century theoretical developments.","I thought I’d begin today–this  is, by the way, the regular practice. Now the word  has a very complicated etymological history that I won’t trouble you with. Very frequently, courses of this kind have a text–a short storyand then once in a while the disquisition of the lecture will pause, the text will be produced, and whatever theory has recently been talked about will be applied to the text; so that you’ll get a postcolonial reading of something, by the way, which is absolutely fascinating and important to do–and so on through the course. That is to say, theory has certain ambitions to a totalization of what can be thought that resembles or rivals philosophy. Now all of these definitions have had currency. We can say there’s a great deal to learn about what people think literature is and we can develop very interesting kinds of thinking about the variety of ways in which these ideas are expressed. Literary theory is very much involved with questions of that kind, and organizing those questions is basically what rationalizes the structure of our syllabus. Finally, literary theory asks one other important question–it asks many, but this is the way at least I’m organizing it for today–it asks one other important question, the one with which we will actually begin: not so much “What is a reader?” How do we put ourselves in touch with the text which may after all in a variety of ways be remote from us?These are the questions that are asked by what’s called hermeneutics, a difficult word that we will be taking up next week. It was fascinating to be–as Wordsworth says, “Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive”–to be around in those days, but at the same time I think it’s rather advantageous for us too to be still “in theory.” In other words, Descartes is still thinking along these same lines. Now as I said, Kant erected such an incredibly magnificent scaffolding around the thing in itself–that is to say, the variety of ways in which although we can’t know it, we can sort of triangulate it and come to terms with it obliquely–that it seems churlish to enlist him on the side of the skeptics, but at the same time there’s a sense of a danger in the distance between subject and object that begins to emerge in thinking of this kind. Marx, in the famous argument about commodity fetishism in ,is comparing the way in which we take the product of human labor and turn it into a commodity by saying that it has objective value, by saying that we know what its value is in and of itself. The argument is exactly the same for Nietzsche, only he shifts the ground of attack. I move from speech to belief because I simply don’t believe that I’m using figures of speech."
394,english,engl-300,lecture-20,"In this lecture on feminist criticism, Professor Paul Fry uses Virginia Woolf’s  as a lens to and commentary on the flourishing of feminist criticism in the twentieth century. The structure and rhetoric of  is extensively analyzed, as are its core considerations of female novelists such as Austen, Eliot, and the Brontës. The works of major feminist critics, such as Ann Douglas, Mary Ellman, Kate Millett, Elaine Showalter, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, are mentioned. The logocentric approach to gender theory, specifically the task of defining female language as something different and separate from male language, is considered alongside Woolf’s own endorsement of literary and intellectual androgyny.","This lecture, I think, starts with a series of preliminaries. That is to say, it has an incredible practical payoff. Now in a way, Woolf is pulling her punches here. At least that person speaking has had certain adventures which are fictitious, or at least I reserve the right to have you suppose that they are fictitious. At that point up arises a beadle, a formidable person wearing Oxonian gowns and pointing at the gravel path where she, as an unauthorized woman, should be walking, as the grass is the province only for the men enrolled in the university; and then she has repeated encounters of that kind. Oscar Wilde’s is one in particular–and which is, in a way, itself what it’s talking about: It is a novella, and in the context of the novella, as I say, there’s a certain tension or contradiction in an author who is allowing herself tendentious opinions while denying the right to have such opinions on the part of one of her predecessors. By and large, feminist critics feel that Charlotte Brontë, or any other writer, has the right to be tendentious. Charlotte Brontë, with all her splendid gift for prose, stumbled and fell with that clumsy weapon in her hands. Women write not just with their heads and their phalluses but with their whole bodies. We’ll come back to this in a minute in Showalter, but in the meantime French feminism was willing to settle on and for an idea of women’s writing and, implicitly behind this idea, an idea of what a woman is that is very easy to identify as somehow or another essentializing. Why does women’s writing, in other words, have to be  writing?It seems to me that it is French feminism and the possible critique of French feminism that Virginia Woolf is anticipating when she embarks on this perilous idea of androgyny, of the kind of mind that needs to be both male and female and that needs to write in a way that Virginia Woolf says is actually very sexy, precisely in the moment when one is not thinking about one’s sex–the moment, in other words, when there is no longer a question of the man’s sentence and the woman’s sentence. By the way, this takes Woolf’s critique of Charlotte Brontë a little bit out of chronology, because presumably Charlotte Brontë belongs to what Showalter is calling “the feminine phase” in the history of the novel, and so it’s interesting that Woolf finds a kind of proto-feminism, damaging to the texture of , already in Charlotte Brontë’s novel. This history of the novel is very similar to what Showalter is doing with her sense of the history of recent feminist criticism. I want you to read Gates’ essay with that particularly in mind."
395,english,engl-300,lecture-21,"In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry examines trends in African-American criticism through the lens of Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Toni Morrison. A brief history of African-American literature and criticism is undertaken, and the relationship of both to feminist theory is explicated. The problems in cultural and identity studies of essentialism, “the identity queue,” expropriation, and biology are surveyed, with particular attention paid to the work of Michael Cooke and Morrison’s reading of . At the lecture’s conclusion, the tense relationship between African-American studies and New Critical assumptions are explored with reference to Robert Penn Warren’s poem, “Pondy Woods.”","So I’m not sure how long this lecture is going to be. We could be finished in ten minutes, though I doubt that, and if we’re not finished at the end of the fifty, there are some things that I’ve reserved for the end of the lecture that I definitely do want to get said. In other words, obviously, apportioning out stereotypes to the various groups that may come forward as candidates to be races–he’s pointing out that all of these stereotypes do nobody very much good. Here it seems to me that her reflections in some ways give us a sideways exit from the predicaments that I have been talking about, the problem of essentialism and the problem of the identity queue, because what Morrison wants to say–and I think she borrows here particularly from the famous discussion of the master-slave dialectic in Hegel’s what Morrison wants to say is that identity isn’t so much a question of what something is but rather a question of what it is not. Then she points out that although her subject is the American tradition, there also exists a European Africanism with its counterpart in its own colonial literature. To reinforce this, she takes a remarkable example which must have reminded you, those of you who know Faulkner, of Thomas Sutpen or at least reminded you in some ways of Thomas Sutpen–the example of this character Dunbar, who actually rose up not so much out of the swamp as out of the Scottish Enlightenment and came to the United States and–according to Bernard Bailyn, the historian from whom she cites her information–became a completely transformed character. Now Gates on page 1896, the right-hand margin, sees it in much the same way for the development of African-American criticism. He says:What I mean by citing these two overworked terms , and also how blacks ,as it were, literature of their own making. In other words, the powers of self-expression available to women from the beginning of their creative expression passed through more than just two stages, and the same thing is true of African-American literature. What does it mean in other words to have this racial identity? As Gates sees it, it continues to be the issue. We’re back in self-veiling because, after all, Phillis Wheatley used other models. Here Gates is after all thinking primarily about criticism. Well, the problem is, from the standpoint of anybody who’s actually read the poem–but remember in some ways it’s a problem raised by a New Critical perspective, and I’ll explain what I mean in a minute–that expression is spoken by a buzzard or vulture from–I forget whether it’s Tennessee or Kentucky. At the same time, we have entertained these ideas of a subliminal author, not an authority but an author welling up from below. If that’s the case, then we have to worry a little bit about how an expression like that got into the poem after all."
396,english,engl-300,lecture-22,"In this lecture on post-colonial theory, Professor Paul Fry explores the work of Edward Said and Homi K. Bhabha. The complicated origins, definitions, and limitations of the term “post-colonial” are outlined. Elaine Showalter’s theory of the phasic development of female literary identity is applied to the expression of post-colonial identities. Crucial terms such as ambivalence, hybridity, and double consciousness are explained. The relationship between Bhabha’s concept of sly civility and Gates’s “signifyin’ ” is discussed, along with the reliance of both on semiotics.","Well, post-colonial studies is really by far the most varied and eclectic of the identity fields that we’re passing in review in this portion of the course: eclectic really of necessity, of course, because of the immense variety of the materials covered, but also because of swirling issues and controversies within post-colonial studies or “po-co,” as it’s affectionately known, which kind of pose a number of questions from the side that keep things lively, to say the least. The first issue, of course, is who says “post-colonial,” and who says that we’re necessarily out of colonialism? We’d think instead, for a moment at least, once again about Virginia Woolf. Instead she is simply overwhelmed, and there’s this avalanche of material. He doesn’t leave out the subject position of the colonizer because he sees them as being radically interrelated, but he plainly is as interested in a variety of ways of talking about the traditions of the colonized as he is of talking about the way in which colonization takes place and expresses itself. That is to say, it’s primary concern is with the binary opposition, a mutual and interdependent binary opposition of central self and decentralized other including, as we’ll see in a minute, the way in which the construction of the otherness of the other is actually covertly also at the same time a means of constructing, defining, and delimiting the nature of selfhood, or in this case of being Western. You can see that Bhabha takes, with respect to the binarism of structuralism, a deconstructive attitude. By the way, this is a tendency that one can find in other forms of theory having to do with identity. I think I’d like actually to begin with a word or two about truth, because Said makes it clear that in a way, the demonization of Orientalism that his project undertakes isn’t really undertaken because Orientalism is necessarily a pack of lies. Said is at pains to make a distinction, therefore, between truth and value. First of all, just to pass in review the way in which he’s indebted to Gramsci on page 1803, the left-hand column, Said says:Culture, of course, is to be found operating within civil society, where the influence of ideas, of institutions and of other persons works not through domination but by what Gramsci calls consent. Both Gramsci and Foucault make the distinction between absolute power and, as Gramsci calls it, hegemony and, as Foucault calls it, power/knowledge. Hastings, in other words, in Saidian terms knew a great deal about the Orientalized other. He really knew everything there was to know and in a certain sense was a person who did go native while at the same time wielding with an iron grip of authority power over the colonized other. He is in fact a person who has himself, in a certain sense, gone native. By the way, if we get baptized we certainly can’t take the Eucharist because that’s eating meat. I think I want to gloss it by suggesting to you that what he’s talking about is that the ambivalence which–and we might as well say right out that he has a term for this ambivalence, and it’s “hybridity”–is the double consciousness of the colonized hovering between submission–that is to say, submission to authority but with a difference, submission to authority on one’s own terms, and on the other hand, acquiescence in authority as given, which of course is basically the position of the missionary."
397,english,engl-300,lecture-23,"In this lecture on queer theory, Professor Paul Fry explores the work of Judith Butler in relation to Michel Foucault’s. Differences in terminology and methods are discussed, including Butler’s emphasis on performance and Foucault’s reliance on formulations such as “power-knowledge” and “the deployment of alliance.” Butler’s fixation with ontology is explored with reference to Levi-Strauss’s concept of the raw and the cooked. At the lecture’s conclusion, Butler’s interrogation of identity politics is compared with that of post-colonial and African-American theorists.","Now, I don’t think it’s ever happened to me before–although it might have but I can’t recall its having happened–that I found myself lecturing on a person who had lectured yesterday here at Yale, but that’s what happened in this case. Some of you may actually have been in attendance. So conveniently enough, for those of you who did attend her lecture yesterday, in many ways she really did return to the issues that concerned her at the period of her career when she wrote and when she wrote the essay that you’ve read for today. I want to read this passage and then comment on it briefly: “In a word , the deployment of alliance is attuned to a homeostasis of the social body…” The deployment of alliance is the way in which, in a given culture, the nuclear reproductive unit is defined, typically as the “family,” but the family in itself changes in its nature and its structure. On the other hand, the deployment of sexuality we understand as the way in which whatever this thing is that we’re trying to define is talked about–and therefore not by any state apparatus or actual legal system necessarily–but nevertheless simply by the prevalence and force of various sorts of knowledge police. What he’s saying is, among other things, that a deployment of sexuality, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing–these deployments aren’t meant somehow or another to be terroristic regimes–a deployment of sexuality, which for example favored forms of sexuality such as birth control or homosexuality, would certainly be a means of controlling reproduction. Now what she’s doing in this sentence, which is an awkward-seeming sentence, “eing a lesbian is what I’ve been,” is pointing out to us that to be something is very different from to be “being” something. I have been taking up a role that can be understood, as all roles can, intelligibly in terms of its performance. In other words, who says heterosexuality came first? These are the sorts of questions, the politicized questions, which these discourses raise in common. Now in method they are somewhat different. Foucault is a more historical writer, although historians often criticize him for not being historical. The reason historians don’t think he’s historical is that he never really explains how you get from one moment in history to the next. He nevertheless is concerned, however, with the way in which views of things change over time, and it’s the change in those views that his argument in  tends to concentrate on; so that he can say that starting in the nineteenth century and continuing to the present, there are essentially four cathected beings around which power-knowledge deploys itself. Again you see that Foucault is right still to suppose that the notion of the Malthusian couple prevails among us. For Butler on the other hand, as you can tell from her style–I am sure that, as in the case of reading Bhabha, you recognize a lot of Derrida in Butler’s style–in Butler it’s a question of taking these same issues and orienting them more in the direction of philosophy. That’s reading a song text in a way that is, precisely, literary theory."
398,english,engl-300,lecture-24,"In this lecture on critical identities, Professor Fry examines the work of Stanley Fish and John Guillory. The lecture begins by examining  as a site for the emergence of literary identities, then brings the course’s use of the children’s story under scrutiny through the lens of Fish. The evolution of Fish’s theory of interpretive communities is traced chronologically through his publications and examined in close-up in Milton’s . John Guillory’s work on interpretive communities and the culture wars leads to a discussion of the Western canon and multiculturalism.","We’ve been passing through a variety of discourses concerning the nature of identity, the way in which identity is constructed–incidentally with varying degrees of emphasis, the way in which identity is constructed in literature. There is no change in the social formations that are the givens of the story, but it nevertheless does lay out the relationship among social norms in ways that show that life goes on despite social inequality, despite–of course here I’m going to throw something at you that you perhaps hadn’t thought of so much in terms of before–despite ethnic and gender difference. On the one hand, he believes in the American dream. It makes sense that first you get Neato and then you would get Speedy. It does seem to me, however, that a story written to that age group in which the climactic line is “He pushed and he pushed and I’m on my way” is pretty obviously about one thing as opposed to a lot of other things. Now this takes us back to the remarks I was making at the beginning about the way in which one can perhaps acknowledge the usefulness of a survey course but nevertheless bridle at the very idea of a survey course when, after all, the only thing that matters is Marx’s thought. Why do we spend any time with all of these other approaches to things and so on–just sort of whichever form of thought is the only thing that matters to you. When I was his student at the University of California, he held his first opinion. This was just before he publisheda book for which a seminar that I was in was a kind of guinea pig."
399,english,engl-300,lecture-25,"In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry takes on Knapp and Michaels’s influential article, “Against Theory.” The historical context of the piece is given and key aspects of the theorists’ critical orientations, specifically their neo-pragmatism, are defined. A lengthy discussion of the relationships between, on the one hand, intention and meaning and, on the other hand, language and speech follows with reference to Saussure, deconstruction, and Russian formalism. Knapp and Michaels’s use of Wordsworth’s “A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal” to explore the limits of meaning and intention is examined in depth. Ultimately, the case is made, using issues subject to dispute in Knapp and Michaels, that theory  a useful and necessary tool in literary studies.","Well, I’d like to welcome the prospective students. Nineteen eighty-two was probably the high-water mark both of the fascination and the frustration with literary theory in this country. Now as I say, they were neo-pragmatists, and what that means basically is that one knows things, which is the same thing as to say that one believes things, such that one acts in the world unhesitatingly as an . As a matter of fact, while I’m going to pay a lot of attention to the first two arguments–there are basically three arguments in this essay–I’m going to pay very little attention to the third argument in which Fish is challenged about the relationship between knowledge and belief, in part at least because it’s an argument that belongs to philosophy. That’s their first argument: people become embroiled in theory when they make one of those two mistakes. Despite their generality, however, these subjects seem to us essentially empirical, and our arguments against theory will not apply to them. After all, nobody knows what the poem means anyway! Wouldn’t you then say, “Oh, therefore it has no meaning, it’s not a representation of anything, it just looks like something”?In other words, in  case–however you feel about “A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal”– in this case you would accept Knapp and Michaels’s argument. You go through all eighteen definitions of a word. It is a record of those actions that have taken place before our own actions as speakers. Suppose we approach it with some rather commonsense remarks. Fire burns us but we can cook with it, and so on. Now in the case of language, we have to suppose as a matter of fact that language, as it were, appeared among us in the same way that the prehensile thumb did. It comes into being in such a way that it is, I would think, scarcely relevant to say that its purpose is for communication. The relationship between the cave and the house, it seems to me, is a particularly interesting way of thinking about the relationship between language as a set of differentials and language as speech. In other words, we take language and we try to make it, as the philosophers say, hook on to the natural world. Those things, those elements that bubble up to the surface, are nothing other than evidence of the presence of language, precisely in the way that in Freud the Freudian slip–the fact that I can’t get through a sentence without making some kind of blunder, very often an embarrassing blunder–is understood as the bubbling up into the conscious effort to speak of that which speech can’t control, of that which Freud calls “the unconscious” and which, by the way, we would have no idea of the existence of if it weren’t for the Freudian slip. You can’t convince them of anything, but that’s not unusual. A text is intended, or you can say, “Well, it may be intended, no doubt it’s intended”–all sorts of ways of putting it, but is that really the point?"
400,english,engl-300,lecture-26,"In this final lecture on literary theory, Professor Paul Fry revisits the relationship between language and speech, language and intention, and language and communication. Over the course of this discussion, he retrospectively defines theory as a means of establishing the extent to which “it is legitimate to be suspicious of communication.” Along the way, he reconnects with New Criticism, Jakobson, Bakhtin, Saussure, de Man, Fish, and Knapp and Michaels. Through an analysis of epitaphs and a final tour through , he underscores the central role of language in the variety of literary theories presented in the course.","Well, last time we saved theory from the clutches of Knapp and Michaels, and we did so by saying that there really is a difference between language and speech. First of all, I want to say that we actually communicate rather well. In other words, if we think of the efficiency or functionality of speech as a medium of communication, we’re forced to ask ourselves, even as we engage in speech, how and why it is that speech is so much burdened in ways that are of no use whatsoever to us for the most part. They’re there, they’re doing a job, but it’s not really a job of anything that we could call communication. Speech is impeded by language in two other ways. You can recite a well-known poem–the one that we took up last time because it was the example given in Knapp and Michaels’ “Against Theory–you can recite a poem while reading this: [referring to what is written on the chalkboard:Ah slum per dead, um, I spear’d seal,Eye add, know Hume, ‘n fierce!Shah seam (duh!)"
401,english,engl-300,lecture-2,"In this second introductory lecture, Professor Paul Fry explores the interrelation of skepticism and determinism. The nature of discourse and the related issue of discursivity is read through two modern works, Anton Chekov’s  and Henry James’ . Exemplary critical focus on literary authority is located in Michel Foucault’s “What Is an Author” and Roland Barthes’ “The Death of the Author,” both of which are read with an emphasis on their historical contexts. Objections to the approach and conclusions of the two theorists are examined, particularly in light of the rise of cultural studies.","Last time we introduced the way in which the preoccupation with literary and other forms of theory in the twentieth century is shadowed by a certain skepticism, but as we were talking about that we actually introduced another issue which isn’t quite the same as the issue of skepticism–namely, determinism. And so, as I say, the question of agency arises. That is to say, he has scrambled into a certain measure of knowledge about things. One of the texts that Yepihodov has read that in a certain sense determines him is Buckle. “ ”That, too, strikes me as a helpful and also characteristic passage that can introduce us to today’s subject, which is the loss of authority: that is to say, in Roland Barthes’ terms, “the death of the author,” and in Foucault’s terms, the question “What is an author?” It could be Berkeley or Columbia or maybe Berlin. In other words, Foucault is up to something interesting, and probably we should meet him at least halfway to see, to measure, the degree of interest we may have in it. This particular lecture course was being given by Georges Poulet, a so-called phenomenological critic. And so yes, the signal that this field of discursivity is on the table is introduced by the name of the author but it remains just a name. Let’s just go ahead,” they are then much more likely, rather than using the word “literature,” to use the word “discourse” or “textual field,” “discursivity.” You begin to hear, or perhaps smell, the slight whiff of jargon that pervades theoretical writing. You’ll get used to it because it’s a word that does a lot of duty, and you need to develop context in which you recognize that well, yeah, I’m talking about the human subject or well, I’m talking about the subject matter; but I trust that you will quickly kind of adjust to that difficulty. This is, again, the atmosphere in which all of this occurs–just then to reinforce this with the pronouncement of Foucault at the bottom of page 913, right-hand column: “The author is therefore the ideological figure by which one marks the manner in which we fear the proliferation of meaning. The founder of discursivity in the gothic novel is not Anne Radcliffe; it’s Horace Walpole, but that’s okay–he talks about Anne Radcliffe as the person who establishes certain tropes, ,and premises that govern the writing of gothic fiction for the next hundred years and, indeed, even in to the present, so that she is, Foucault acknowledges, in a certain sense a person who establishes a way of talking, a way of writing, a way of narrating. Plainly, there are a great many people who think of them as tyrants, right, but within the traditions that they established, it is very possible to understand them as instigating ways of thinking without necessarily presiding over those ways of thinking authoritatively. I don’t want to be called an instrument of something larger than myself because frankly that’s what I’ve always been, and I want precisely as an authority through my authorship to remind you that I am not anybody’s instrument but that I am autonomous and free."
402,english,engl-300,lecture-3,"In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry examines acts of reading and interpretation by way of the theory of hermeneutics. The origins of hermeneutic thought are traced through Western literature. The mechanics of hermeneutics, including the idea of a hermeneutic circle, are explored in detail with reference to the works of Hans-George Gadamer, Martin Heidegger, and E. D. Hirsch. Particular attention is paid to the emergence of concepts of “historicism” and “historicality” and their relation to hermeneutic theory.","Let’s hope we can free our minds of these matters now and turn to something a little more substantive, which is the question–before we plunge in to Gadamer really: what is hermeneutics? It goes without saying therefore what it means. I don’t understand what your metaphors are all about. In particular, the great theologian of the Romantic period, Friedrich Schleiermacher, devoted his career to principles of hermeneutics that were meant to be applied as much to literature as to the study of scripture, and established a tradition in which it was understood that literature was a central focus of hermeneutics. A circle, in other words, is not necessarily a vicious circle. As you can tell from your reading of Gadamer–and of course, the title of the great book from which this excerpt is taken is orwith its implicit suggestion that there is a difference between truth and method–the great objection of Gadamer to other people’s way of doing hermeneutics is that they believe that there is a methodology of interpretation. I’ll say again, somewhat in advance perhaps of the time I should say it, that Gadamer thinks that there’s something immoral about historicism. It’s an interesting thought experiment to try not to know that that’s a sign that says “exit.” but he’s also insisting that this is an incredibly difficult, if not impossible, moment of thought. So that’s why–and this is perhaps the essential, the central passage, and I don’t want to pause over it–but you can look at passage number three on your sheet, which says roughly again what Heidegger is saying in the first passage–that’s why we must work always as interpreters with preconceptions, with fore-understandings. That’s where the bad side of prejudice sneaks in. Slavery was an aspect of classical culture which had its defenses. I think that what I’d like to do in the time remaining is to call your attention to two passages, one in Gadamer’s text which I’m about to read and the other the fourth passage on your sheet by someone called E. D. Hirsch, whom you may actually know as the author of a dictionary of what every school child should know and as a sort of a champion of the intellectual right during the whole period when literary theory flourished, but a person who also is seriously invested in hermeneutics and conducted a lifelong feud with Gadamer about the principles of hermeneutics. If I’m proud of knowing that in another culture if I belch after dinner it’s a compliment to the cook, right, and if I’m proud of knowing that without drawing any conclusions from it, that’s sort of the equivalent of historicism. Notice that although the nobility of this alongside the nobility of Gadamer is obvious and painful  and really does seem to bring us to a crossroads where we really want to be Yogi Berra, right, and go in both directions–even though this is the case, notice one thing. Gadamer is willing to sacrifice because of his belief in the inescapability of preconception. I am not just saying “plastic” means “polymer,” right, but nevertheless there’s something of me in the interpretation. All you need to do is read him and you will recognize that it does matter to Hirsch whether the other speaks true, but it’s not implicit in the philosophical position he’s taking up here."
403,english,engl-300,lecture-4,"The discussion of Gadamer and Hirsch continues in this lecture, which further examines the relationship between reading and interpretation. Through a comparative analysis of these theorists, Professor Paul Fry explores the difference between meaning and significance, the relationship between understanding and paraphrasing, and the nature of the gap between the reader and the text. Through Wolfgang Iser’s essay, “The Reading Process,” the nature of textual expectation and surprise, and the theory of their universal importance in narrative, is explained. The lecture concludes by considering the fundamental, inescapable role that hermeneutic premises play in canon formation.","So before we go on to talk a little bit about the American historicist hermeneutical scholar E. D. Hirsch, and then Wolfgang Iser–for whom you have your reading assignment–I want to go back to Gadamer a little bit and say something more about his taste, that is to say, the kind of literary and intellectual canon that his approach to hermeneutics establishes. Gadamer, in other words, doesn’t think that the reader can perform any great miracles in intuitively feeling his or her way into the mind of another time and place, so that the value of classicism and of tradition for Gadamer is that there is evident common ground in certain texts. But Gadamer’s view is very strongly that this conservatism about the canon, which is intimately related to his conservative doubt about the actual capability of a reader to span enormous gaps–and I use that word advisedly because it is the word that Iser uses to talk about the distance between the reader and the text, and the way in which that distance should be negotiated–so in any case this conservatism, it seems to me, however, can be questioned. When our political opponent is being ironic about our views we understand the irony perfectly well. We’re open to being told something true by someone else. In other words, the text is what makes the ascertainment of meaning possible and available to us, but meaning is not  the text. which is obviously one point of disagreement with Hirsch. Now you can do anything you like with the text. Now how then does he differ from Gadamer? Significance is the application of that construal to something. That’s what makes it so different from Gadamer’s conservative continuous traditional canon. The first is on page 1003, the upper left-hand column: “In this process of creativity”–that is to say, the way in which a text induces the feeling of surprise in the reader– “the text may either not go far enough, or may go too far…”Now I admit in this particular passage you get a hint of Gadamer’s element of conservatism. If the surprises are too great, then they induce overstrain and we throw away the book in frustration and despair. There is a kind of a vogue recurrently in the history of fiction for a kind of miraculous sense that this is just exactly the way things are. You can look at it now or at your leisure. The tension or suspense is: what will the moral be? It happens to end “Now that’s what I call a friend.” The moral is that reciprocity is friendship and so good, all to the good, but as I say there’s a moment of suspense in the expectation at the point in the text when we expect a moral but we don’t know what the moral is going to be."
404,english,engl-300,lecture-5,"In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry explores the origins of formalist literary criticism. Considerable attention is paid to the rise and subsequent popularity of the New Critics and their preferred site of literary exploration, the “poem.” The idea of autonomous art is explored in the writings of, among others, Kant, Coleridge, and Wilde. Using the work of Wimsatt and Beardsley, the lecture concludes with an examination of acceptable categories of evidence in New Criticism.","Moving then as quickly as possible into our subject matter for today, we begin a series of lectures on various aspects of twentieth-century formalism–a big word. You can see that when Wimsatt and Beardsley talk about the “success” of the poem, they understand the whole critical enterprise, including its theoretical underpinnings–the question of what is a poem, the question of how should we best read it–to be still geared toward literary evaluation. But there are other ways of approaching this material. In this edition he, while actually a fervent admirer of Plato, nevertheless develops this idea of Aristotle with remarkable rhetorical ingenuity and I think very impressively lays out the case that Aristotle first makes, here in the first passage on your sheet. Sidney is a devoutly religious person and there’s no semblance of doubt in his attitude, and yet he is saying something very special about the poet who is somewhere in between divinity and the other sorts of discourse with which poetry is traditionally in rivalry: science, philosophy and history. He does a great deal else in it, but I’m isolating this strand, which is what’s relevant to what we’re talking about. Kant makes a distinction between the purposive and the purposeful. It has its own purpose, which is not a purpose that has any bearing necessarily on anything else. Both act on the will and excite a desire for the actual existence of the image or idea contemplated, while the sense of beauty rests gratified in the mere contemplation or intuition regardless whether it be a fictitious Apollo or a real Antinous. On the other hand, a lot of people think it’s all hokum, and in fact the predominant view in the twentieth century has been that there’s no such thing as disinterestedness, that whatever we are looking at we have an interest in and form views of, and that this Kantian moment of dispassionate or disinterested contemplation is what the early twentieth-century critic I.A. Richards called a “phantom aesthetic state.” Maybe we doubt that the difference is absolute in the way that Kant wants to insist it is. Nevertheless, we have in tendency feelings of this kind and we should acknowledge them because again, at least in terms of a weak understanding of these positions, it does tend to justify them. Again it’s Wimsatt and Beardsley, but I already explained how that is. The great creator raised his plastic arm, right?"
405,english,engl-300,lecture-6,"In this second lecture on formalism, Professor Paul Fry begins by exploring the implications of Wimsatt and Beardsley’s theory of literary interpretation by applying them to Yeats’s “Lapis Lazuli.” He then maps the development of Anglo-American formalism from Modernist literature to the American and British academies. Some time is spent examining the similarities and differences between the works of I. A. Richards and his protegé, William Empson. The lecture finally turns to a discussion of Cleanth Brooks’s conception of unity.","Now last time we were giving examples of what might happen if one takes seriously that extraordinary eleventh footnote in Wimsatt’s “The Intentional Fallacy”in which he says that the history of words  a poem was composed may well be relevant to the overall structure of the poem and should not be avoided owing simply to a scruple about intention. He is just borrowing that word from the translation of a book by Nietzsche. So the criterion is: is it relevant to the unified form that we as critics are trying to realize in the text? This was the golden age of the consolidation of the literary profession. His sense of the way in which the mind reacts to the world, to its experience, and the way in which it’s an uncomplicated reaction, a resisting reaction, or an adjusting reaction, all has very much to do with Pavlovian principles. In other words, we are a chaos of desires. He has, in other words, all of the attributes of a great comic writer. It’s something that can be described, something that can be analyzed. So all of this distances Empson from Richards to a certain extent, but the most important difference, I think, between Empson and the other figures we’re discussing–a difference which makes it even a little bit complex to say that he’s a precursor of the New Criticism–is that Empson very rarely concerns himself with the  of a text. Maybe, after all, poetry is an expression of the irreducible conflict of our needs. Here Brooks, in , ,and the other books for which he’s well known, uses a variety of different words to describe the way in which the complexity of literature is placed in the service of unification. You remember that in “My Credo,”the little sort of excerpt that you get at the beginning of the Brooks section in your anthology, Brooks says, “Poetry should be about moral things but it shouldn’t point a moral.” Obviously points a moral and so would be subject to a kind of devaluation on those grounds by the New Criticism–even though there are ways of reading, as I’ve been suggesting, New Critic-ally. The connotation, I have suggested, is of the variety of kinds that one might gingerly approach in thinking about complicating the texture of the story. Why is he calling attention, in other words, to this logical disparity? “ This, as I say, is a different use of close reading. In other words, it insists on the need to balance opinions, to balance viewpoints, and to balance needs, precisely in a way which is, of course, implicitly a kind of social and political centrism. There is a kind of implicit Episcopalian perspective that you see in Brooks’s essay when he’s talking about the Shakespeare poem, in which, under the aspect of eternity, inevitably things here on earth seem ironic."
406,english,engl-300,lecture-7,"In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry explores the works of major Russian formalists reviewed in an essay by Boris Eikhenbaum. He begins by distinguishing Russian formalism from hermeneutics. Eikhenbaum’s dependency on core ideas of Marxist and Darwinian philosophies of struggle and evolution is explained. Formalism’s scientific language and methodical aspirations are discussed. Crucial formalist distinctions between plot and story, practical and poetic language, and literature and literariness are clarified.","So today we start a sequence which takes us through deconstruction, and it’s a sequence which has genuine coherence. I think much will come clear when we actually get into what’s called “structuralism” and you read the essay by Roman Jakobson called “Linguistics and Poetics,” Jakobson having spent the early part of his career as a card-carrying member of OPOJAZ, the journal of the Russian formalists; and then who, owing to various forces that I’ll be talking about, emigrated first to Prague, Czechoslovakia where he joined a linguistic circle, which in a variety of ways proved to be the origin of what’s called structuralism. Hermeneutics is, well, more or less by nature and by definition, interested in meaning. In other words, whereas the New Critics and Wolfgang Iser are interested in the roughening of form, they’re interested in it for hermeneutic purposes. So they are still engaged in the hermeneutic enterprise in interpretation. Now obviously, the struggle takes place against the backdrop of completely undisciplined and unsystematic thinking which Eikhenbaum identifies as the typical thinking of the universities, of the academy. You’ll see this more and more clearly as you read through the text and as we talk about it. So in literature you have something like–if you think in terms of literary evolution as Jurij Tynjanov does in the essay that the passage on your sheet concludes–if you think in those terms, you think about literary history itself as a sequence of changes in which devices and aspects of the literary text struggle for dominance within and over against other devices. In the meantime, Trotsky’s book is a shot fired across the bow of those forms of “aestheticism”–quote, unquote–which can be understood as self-involved, self-preoccupied, and indifferent to history and class struggle. By the same token, Shklovsky insists, and his colleagues insist, that the business of the roughening of surface by means of various modes of literariness is to defamiliarize automated perceptions; to make us suddenly see again, to see the nature of the language that we’re using, and, indeed, also to see–this is very clear, by the way, in the essay “Literature as Technique” in your anthology that I recommended that you read–at the same to see the world itself anew by means of devices of language that tear the film away from our eyes. It means something like a kind of dulled grayness or ordinariness of life. The newness that the Russian formalists are interested in is not just any newness. Every aspect of the structure of the text can be understood as having a function. Now this is an example of a text in which alliteration is plainly predominant. I think of that story that all of you have probably read in school, by Tim O’Brien. In Wordsworth or Joyce or Woolf, the dominant is the interiority of consciousness–that is, the way in which what we call stream of consciousness or the inwardness of thought –this is another word that you encounter in Eikhenbaum’s essay–motivates everything else that goes on in the text. It is obviously also the materialist, or, social position. This is what Tynjanov says:In formalist historiography, the prime significance of major social factors is not at all discarded."
407,english,engl-300,lecture-8,"In this lecture, Professor Paul Fry explores the semiotics movement through the work of its founding theorist, Ferdinand de Saussure. The relationship of semiotics to hermeneutics, New Criticism, and Russian formalism is considered. Key semiotic binaries–such as  and , signifier and signified, and synchrony and diachrony–are explored. Considerable time is spent applying semiotics theory to the example of a “red light” in a variety of semiotic contexts.","So I’m going to be pointing to the board, at least in theory. So that is an aspect of our sequence of lectures, beginning with the last one, that will be postponed until next week. Scholars who go to Geneva go for a variety of reasons when they look at the Saussure archive. There is, in other words, a semiotics of virtually every imaginable thing understood as a language made up of a system of signs–signs we’ll be getting to in a minute–but in the meantime, it’s important to understand what semiology actually is. The fact that human language is not my language–that is to say, the fact that it doesn’t originate in me, the fact that it’s not, in other words, my private language–suggests, of course, a certain loss because it means that when I speak, when I use language in speech, I’m using something that is not strictly my own. Saussure’s famous diagrams make it clear enough. The first thing he has to say is that the signified-signifier relationship, as I said, is arbitrary. By the way, in what I’m saying, I oversimplify by supposing that the basic unit of language is a word. In other words, whatever you are thinking of as your systematizing, your understanding, of language, and as the basic constituent unit–“the word” being probably one of the less popular choices,  even though that’s the one I’ve just used–the blanket term for that is “the tagmeme.” This is true even of seemingly identical signs, because each has its use value and is only intelligible as that which it exists to mean in a certain context. So it is always the case that I can only know what I know if it’s a question of being communicated with, having something rendered intelligible for me, negatively. I look at something and I know what it is, forgetting that possibly I only know what it is because of a context in which indeed it is not those other things that are linked to it. And of course it exists in a semiotic relationship to a white light over a street door which means “this is my house; if you wish you can ring the bell but I’d just as soon you stayed out.” The red light is intelligible, in other words, within that semiotic system. The very fact that I need to know it in particular is what makes me need to know it negatively. What we’re talking about today is how we  know things. Now this unfolding is not, according to the semioticians–and here’s another link with the Russian formalists–is not a question of studying the way in which language is changed from without–that is to say, studying the way in which, for example, an individual can rise up and insist on changing one of the signs; but rather a sequence of synchronic cross-sections."
408,english,engl-300,lecture-9,"In this lecture on the work of Roman Jakobson, Professor Paul Fry continues his discussion of synchrony and diachrony. The relationships among formalism, semiotics, and linguistics are explored. Claude Levi-Strauss’s structural interpretation of the Oedipus myth is discussed in some detail. In order to differentiate Jakobson’s poetic functions, Professor Fry analyzes the sentence “It is raining” from six perspectives. Significant attention is paid to the use of diagrams in literary linguistic theory.","Last time I lectured under the illusion that–I really should get in the habit of looking at the syllabus–that all you had been assigned for Thursday’s lecture was the Saussure. To consider language  is to consider it at a given moment synchronically. Now matters are complicated a little bit on those occasions in your reading when people are talking about the way in which a mass of material–a system of language or other semiotic system, let’s say–is inferred from existing data: in other words, the way in which I infer language, , from a sentence, –I’m actually concealing from you that in fact Saussure uses a third term, , to talk about the sum of all sentences, but we won’t get into that–the way in which language is inferred from . So in space, whereas , speech, unfolds in time so that, because it is temporal–because any speech any of us makes is in a certain sense historical, [laughs> because the beginning of the sentence is earlier in history than the end of the sentence–for that reason, there’s a relationship between diachrony and the unfolding of , or of a sentence or of an utterance which is parallel, though at the same time admittedly confusing. Formalism takes the object and it doesn’t decompose it. That is to say, when Antigone tries to bury her brother and goes to the wall for that, in ways that you might find excessive, that’s an over-determination of blood relations. The reason we limp is that we have a foot of clay, that something of the earth from which we were born sticks to us, and this is a recurrent pattern, a recurrent idea, in the unfolding of the Oedipus myth. He becomes a kind of genius of the place at Colonus. Then I had an incredible lapse of memory. I couldn’t remember a synonym for “ship,” but I hope that I got my point across to you and indicated that there are varieties of ways in which any given sign clusters with other signs. Obviously, it stretches just as in versification. Metonymy is a selection of signs, if you will, that go appropriately next to each other according to the rules of grammar and syntax and according to the rules of logic, right; but also perhaps in the ways in which the rhetorical device of metonymy can be understood. The available signs to be selected, on the other hand, on the axis of selection are selected for certain purposes if they are metaphoric. That’s what Jakobson calls “the set to the addressee”: that is to say, the basic dominant bearing that the message has, the “set,” is a set to the addressee. For the poetic function to be dominant–as I suggested when I said a Romantic poet wouldn’t be very smart if he or she said “It was raining”–would really be taxing for anyone who wanted to make it so. So that then, sort of, perhaps serves to suffice as an analysis of Jakobson’s understanding of the structure of an utterance."
409,english,engl-310,lecture-10,"The early poetry of T.S. Eliot is examined. Differences between Pound and Eliot, in particular the former’s interest in translation versus the latter’s in quotation, are suggested. Eliot’s relationship to tradition is considered in his essay, “Tradition and the Individual Talent.” The early poem, “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” is read, with emphasis on the poem’s resistance to traditional forms and its complicated depiction of its speaker’s fragmentary consciousness.","In talking about Pound and  last week, I was talking about translation a lot. And I spoke last time as if the impulse meant the motive or the emotion in a piece of writing. It’s something that is capable of being carried forward. And you think about Pound’s voyagers, his seafarers – Odysseus or the “Seafarer” poet – as being agents or representatives of acts of translation. And these places return and recur in his poetry. This is a letter in which Pound felt the need to, probably with some encouragement but probably also some embarrassment, from Eliot, felt the need to defend Eliot’s expatriation to the family patriarch. At this early point in Eliot’s career there is a kind of important conflict between conformity and revolt: conformity to his parents’ wishes, social expectations; or revolt from them, which is also, I think, another way to describe the tension between two different senses or aspects of quotation. I think it’s also potentially a kind of emblem of quotation in his work. These are questions we might ask even about the waistcoat. On that cover we see Eliot’s name and Prufrock’s, in some kind of alteration – alternation, rather – “Prufrock” being a little bit bigger than “T. S. Eliot,” but raising for us graphically the simple question: what is the relationship between these two? How different are they?Here’s the interior of the book. It is a way of speaking that is interrupted, often; is alternately voluble and nervous. Tennyson specifically, in this dramatic monologue, as in others of his  or other important nineteenth-century examples, introduces us to a dramatic speaker who has a kind of coherent character and whose unity of character, if you like, is allied to the unity of the verse form itself. Fluctuation: this is the medium and the rhythm that we enter when we enter the poem. But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things. Prufrock is burdened by the question of how to begin. Indeed, he begins exactly by deferring beginning; by failing to come to the point; by putting it off; by delaying because by implication, beginning is indeed something threatening, something that must be dared."
410,english,engl-310,lecture-11,"Professor Hammer’s discussion of “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” continues with particular attention paid to the poem’s psychological, social, and generic elements. Eliot’s place in literary criticism and his modernist poetics are considered in the essay “The Metaphysical Poets.” The essay’s critique of Romanticism serves as a bridge to Eliot’s masterwork, , the first lines of which are presented and analyzed.  ",": On Monday I left off talking about this – what shall we call it – exciting and dramatic ambivalence that one finds in the early Eliot that expresses itself in his relationship to literary tradition; where on the one hand, he presents himself as a truly subversive and aggressive entrant into literary tradition, someone who’s really going to shake it up and transform it; and on the other hand, as someone who is a traditionalist, who is going to speak with deference and seek – the word he uses is “conformity” – with the past. And “Prufrock” itself is a poem, I think, preoccupied with this kind of ambivalence that I’m describing. This problem expresses, I think, Eliot’s double relation to the past and is expressed, as I was suggesting last time, in the ambiguous use of quotation that seems to hover between some kind of deferential honoring of the literature of the past and something much more provocative and often parodic. In, again, Freudian or Oedipal terms, terms that Harold Bloom would develop as a reader of Eliot in his own criticism very influentially, you can put the problem this way: how can Eliot come to write in the father’s place without killing him or being overwhelmed by him? And sometimes Yeats represents himself that way. And so you have to consider them together. Well, here is quite an extraordinary account of English literary history. Is it a mirror of a various and complex civilization? Or is it perverse and eccentric: an arbitrary assertion of authorial will? They’re seen as Romantic illusions, clichés. It is, of course, in its own way, quite as daring and disturbing a poem, disturbing to the universe of poetry at least, as any modern poem. You could say that what the poem does is to intellectualize longing. In a sense, I think, you could say he wants Romantic singing. Perhaps he wants to be able to join in it himself, which is a wish for lyric inspiration, isn’t it? On page 486, I’ll just focus on one of these imperatives:Da : I have heard the key Turn in the door once and turn once only We think of the key, each in his prison Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison Only at nightfall, aethereal rumours Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus Da : The boat responded Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar The sea was calm, your heart [and there’s this interesting switch of tense] would have responded Gaily, when invited, beating obedient To controlling handsWell, “” is translated here as “sympathize.” I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter."
411,english,engl-310,lecture-12,"In this lecture, Professor Hammer considers the psycho-sexual aspects of T.S. Eliot’s, . The landscape of the poem is described and its key figures introduced. Particular emphasis is placed on couples and scenes of dialogue with aspects of romantic or sexual distress. At the lecture’s conclusion, a broad summation of the individual units of the poem is presented, and the editing process, in particular Ezra Pound’s contributions, is reflected upon.  ","This is a kind of oxymoron, “a private ritual,” because ritual is, or should be, precisely something that’s collective and shared. They include, well, some form of ecstasy. Son of man, You cannot say, or guess, for you know only A heap of broken images, where the sun beats, And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief, And the dry stone no sound of water. Here, you know, we’ve got a kind of fragment of sacred text, itself, you know, if you like, a bit of rubbish that’s part of the poem’s heap of broken images that we will explore. This Wagner text and the little quotation from it down below – again, another quotation from Wagner, “Oed’ und leer das Meer” – is a more sinister and haunting phrase that may be translated as, “waste and empty the sea” or “desolate and empty the sea” here. These materials together, I think, suggest that the loss of common experience that comes with the withdrawal of God is played out between people in their erotic relationships. And this is a theme that the poem will return to again and again. Well, Part I, “The Burial of the Dead,” ends with another instance of scene-setting. Flowed up the hill and down  King William Street, To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine. It’s where the events of the poem will take place, more or less. There is, perhaps, a kind of glimpse of the still echoing World War in the here imagined hailing of one man who knew another in battle. But at my back from time to time I hear  The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring. And then finally, after this emblematic sacrifice, we are introduced to the long final section “What the Thunder Said,” when there is a return of divine speech and the promise of rain and of water, what the poem seems to be looking for: aligning the redemptive regeneration that would come with the rain with the experience of divine speech made present here in that simple syllable, “.”Let me say just a couple things about the shape of the poem as we have it. Pound wants to get the Romanticism and lyricism of the poem out of it in certain ways. Eliot resists that, and there are ways in which these two men working together and against each other to create the poem enact some of the poem’s own struggle with lyricism and with Romanticism and help us to see that struggle as part of what goes into the creation of the poem itself. Eliot presents himself as this figure, a poet who is also a kind of scholar."
412,english,engl-310,lecture-13,"The early poetry of Hart Crane is presented and analyzed. Crane’s self-characterization as a visionary, Romantic, and erotic poet, as well as the unique nature of his poetic project are considered as responses to Eliot’s and in particular the section “Death by Water.” The poems “Legend,” “Voyages,” and “At Melville’s Tomb” are read with particular attention to Crane’s idiosyncratic use of language and neologism.  ","He’s a challenge for you; he’s a challenge for me as a teacher. Then, drop by caustic drop, a perfect cry Shall string some constant harmony, –  Relentless caper for all those [and here we are challenged and invited to meet him and join him] who step The legend of their youth into the noon. Crane got his copy of  smuggled from France, which a friend then stole. After this perfection of death [which is what Crane is – this is how he’s reading ] nothing is possible in motion but a resurrection of some kind .Crane is reading  and he’s reading Eliot’s criticism. He is establishing himself in what I described as a new role, and that’s very much the role you see Eliot embodying here; that is, the poet as a kind of scholar poet, a figure backed by institutional authority of various kinds. The poem arises from a love affair with, as it happens, a Danish sailor who was part of the Bohemian crowd around the Provincetown Players in Greenwich Village. And I know now that there is such a thing as indestructibility, in the deepest sense where flesh became transformed through intensity of response to counter-response, where sex was beaten out, where a purity of joy was reached that included tears. The poem begins with a simple moral injunction or, really, a practical warning. He says to the sea:Bequeath us  to no earthly shore [in other words, “don’t bury us”] until [and as in legend, Crane produces a funny, syntactic reversal here] Is answered in the vortex of our grave The seal’s wide spindrift gaze toward paradise. The seal is here a figure of a kind of consciousness and desire expressed through the eyes that survives death. You don’t have the ground under your feet."
413,english,engl-310,lecture-14,"Hart Crane’s masterwork  is positioned as a response to the modernist aesthetics of T.S. Eliot’s . The visionary and specifically American aspects of the epic are stressed. Crane’s interest in myth and symbol, his inclusion and treatment of marginal figures, and his refiguring of the American hero are considered alongside his unique perspective on the role of imagination in the creation and shaping of history.","In order to get to  I want to go back and just say a few more things about “Voyages” and about Crane in general. It’s also about reading Melville and getting his message; that is, reaching back into the past and becoming, for Melville, the kind of reader that Crane himself seeks as he describes it in his letter to Monroe. In this poem, the mixing of words in poetry is analogized to the mixing of bodies of lovers. In this sense, Crane is talking about some kind of passage through death, and you can understand that death as Crane’s admission, as I suggested last time, of the illusory nature of rhetoric, of love itself, of the power of desire, which Crane is always realistic about, you could say. This is a photograph by Walker Evans, who took many images of the bridge with its cables and Gothic arches, all of which play into Crane’s poems in complex ways. To aim at Atlantis, as the poem does, and as Crane says American history does, is to go interestingly, confusingly, simultaneously into the past and into the future; to rescue or recover something from history, promised for the future; and to bring that future into being. He speaks to us on his way back, and it introduces the theme of carrying the message or the vision forward into the future. The poem in this way charts various journeys westward and eastward, back and forth in time. For Crane, metaphor is as central a concept and activity as translation is for Pound. I don’t know about you, but I am thrilled every time I read Crane’s language for evoking the kind of sensual power of New York architecture. Up the index of night, granite and steel –  Transparent meshes – fleckless the gleaming staves –  Sibylline voices flicker, waveringly stream As though a god were issue of the strings….Here at the end of the poem, Crane imagines a kind of ascent through the structure of the bridge which becomes a grand musical instrument, a harp. In the same way, Crane is suggesting that every moment in American history links up with others and with a larger structure of action, of which it is part."
414,english,engl-310,lecture-15,"The poetry of Langston Hughes is considered as a representation of the African-American experience. The distinctive concerns of Hughes’s poetic project are juxtaposed with the works of other modernists, such as Pound, Eliot, Frost, and Stevens.  Hughes’s interest in and innovative use of musical forms, such as blues and jazz, is explored with particular attention to their role in African-American culture, as well as their use by Hughes to forge an alternative to dominant modes of expression within the modernist canon.Langston Hughes, “Song for a Dark Girl,” 1927 and “Life is Fine,” 1949. Used by permission of Harold Ober Associates.","Let’s start with a poem you probably know. This is a remarkable poem for a young man to write. This is a picture of Hughes still in the mid-twenties when his work was just being read for the first time. It’s a remarkable poem, I think, for a young poet to begin with. When Ezra Pound read it, he wrote to her and asked, since he didn’t know – he had never met her – was she Ethiopian? That plan fell away, but there are still traces of that intention in his section of the poem called “The River,” which tries to evoke aspects of black experience, to integrate jazz, blues, and spirituals into Crane’s poetry and make them part of the history that “The Bridge” tells. This, too, is part of Eliot’s oeuvre, though not part of the public form of it, and it’s important information about at least one way in which black life figured in the high modernist imagination of Eliot and others. But it’s an interesting and important image of the man Hughes was as he began to write poems like “The Negro Speaks of Rivers. And perhaps these common people will give to the world its truly great Negro artist, the one who is not afraid to be himself .These are important statements. If he’s a city poet, he’s not a poet of the village or of London, but rather of Harlem. And alas, this is not what John Kerry wanted to project. Hughes, from  forward, frequently presents his poems as forms of music as allied to, as identified with, as perhaps metaphorical versions of African-American forms, particularly, but not only, the blues. As in other Hughes poems, the word here seems to mean “black,” also “darkened”: abused, grieving, shadowed. In general, in the case of refrains, they function in a variety of ways. It’s lifted high in air, not in honor or tribute. And this is something very different from the nakedness that Yeats boasts of in his poems."
415,english,engl-310,lecture-16,"The poetry of William Carlos Williams is presented and analyzed. His use of enjambment to surprise and transform is examined in order to highlight Williams’s interest in depicting creative and cognitive processes. The Imagist qualities of much of Williams’s poetry is considered alongside his engagement with modernist art–particularly the preoccupation of Duchamps and Cubist painters with the process of representing sensual perception. His free verse, which includes the innovative use of white space and carefully, visually balanced lines, establishes his position as one of the most visually-oriented poets in all of modernism.",": I’m going to talk about William Carlos Williams today. And this is a quality and energy that he wants to have in his poetry itself. Well, I think you have to see that poem to start to really be able to read it. Unlike “In a Station of the Metro,” “The Red Wheelbarrow,” or let me call it instead “So Much Depends,” is a poem without a title. That choice increases the immediacy of our experience. Looking at it, well, as I suggested before, it’s not a poem, I think, that we begin by hearing, and we have to start reading it and seeing it before we can even think about how to really speak it properly. And he identifies here, as elsewhere, this property of novelty with a kind of verse that eschews rhyme and meter, a whole host of existing poetic conventions. Free verse is in that sense Williams’s chosen medium; free verse meaning a poem not patterned by metrical scheme or rhyme, or indeed some other, in a sense, pre-existing principle or pattern. And this is itself almost like a metrical or rhyme scheme. The other dimension of the Duchamp anecdote that’s nice, and about Williams is telling, is that a stained glass window that has fallen out is something you come upon or find. Duchamp takes postimpressionism to New York in the form of dada – a movement with its importance for Williams, too, including, I think, Duchamp’s mischievousness and his willingness to provoke the subversive – to take Williams’s word – and to play with expectations about what constitutes art, as Williams in certain ways would play with our expectations about what could constitute a poem or poetic statement. And again here: an urban scene, that is realist in its mode of representation, and yet the foregrounding of the lines created by the different shapes of the buildings call attention to this as indeed a kind of constructed image that seems to be moving out of the realm of realist representation to something more symbolic and certainly avowedly created by the artist."
416,english,engl-310,lecture-17,"The poetry of Marianne Moore is considered alongside its preoccupations with gender, American culture, and nature. The poem “A Grave” is presented as characteristic of the prose rhythms and discursive manner of Moore’s poems, including their use of expository language without meter or rhyme. The poem “England” is read as a defense of American culture, in opposition to the Eurocentricism of Eliot, Pound, and other modernists. In the poem “An Octopus,” Moore makes use of excerpts from pamphlets and other unusual prose sources to suggest that inspiration is not limited to any one voice or to literary models.",": I was wanting to carry over more Williams today. This is not a kind of formal organization that you hear, and it’s even difficult to see, but it’s an operative one for her and it’s one of the ways in which she organizes her verse. In all these ways that I’m describing – the syllable count, the expository writing, the Latinate diction, the self-conscious, prose-like nature of the language, all those semi-colons – this is poetry that has distanced itself from traditions of song, and certainly from nineteenth-century traditions of versification. She was annoyed into poetry, you could say, and she took her mother with her. In this poem the human, imagined finally as something that twists and turns in the depths, is converted by natural forces into a part of the natural world that it sought through the man’s perspective to dominate. Again, these are aspects of restraint in the poetry. She does it, rather, specifically in this act of challenging “man. That somehow “volition” is more important than “consciousness,” that it’s the last thing to go and the most dramatic thing to lose. In fact, that’s really what this whole poem is about, you could say. It is an attack on Eurocentric, cultural snobs. And she was talking about all the things that should go in poetry, even business documents and school books. And in this sense the title, in fact, turns out to be important and to give us important information, because she’s out here to make England less important and to deny it its pride of place. She engrosses them; she gathers them to her; she masters her reading. She brings them into this poem in, as I say, a kind of collage."
417,english,engl-310,lecture-18,"The previous lecture’s examination of “The Octopus” is continued, focusing on Moore’s innovative use of quotation. The poem “Silence” is read in connection with nineteenth-century poetry and the poet’s personal reticence. Selections from Elizabeth Bishop’s personal memoir of Moore are presented with special attention to Moore’s relationships with other modernists and male poets in particular. The poem “To a Snail” is considered as a meditation on style and compression, and a reading of “The Paper Nautilus” rounds out a wider examination of the use and meaning of restraint in Moore’s poetry.",": Let’s see, last time I wanted to talk to you about Moore as a woman poet, as an American poet, and as a nature poet. The image of the octopus itself, the glacier on top of Mount Rainier, has, I think, sort of eight arms, and that’s what she is playing with. And then she calls the mountain “damned for its sacrosanct remoteness”; that is, she’s saying people damn this mountain because it’s too high and far and remote to climb. “ The fastidiousness, decorum, restraint — these aesthetic and ethical values in short are here attached to powers and intensity that we don’t ordinarily associate with them. The volcano signifies a kind of virginal force. And yet, she seems to understand the power that was in those rules for Moore. Gusto” is the sort of virtue of, let’s say, energy that Moore approves in writing and art, above all, in certain ways, and she says at the bottom of the page: “Gusto thrives on freedom, and freedom in art, as in life.” Further down, she starts to generalize again. Those things that have life in that sense are not merely things but creations that are infused with creative force. The really great poem, I think, on this theme is “The Paper Nautilus.” This, you could say, is a kind of revision of the earlier image of female power as volcanic. And interestingly, this creature, like the mountain, is an octopus, viewed as if it were a poem or as a kind of version of what a poem is. Hope, here at the end of the poem, is renamed love, a force imaged, again, through a kind of silence, through its absence, or rather through the traces of its continuing presence, which are the traces that we see in the strength and beauty of the object which is, I think, ultimately the difference between silence and restraint: that is, love is present in the poem."
418,english,engl-310,lecture-19,"Wallace Stevens is considered as an unapologetically Romantic poet of imagination. His search for meaning in a universe without religion in “Sunday Morning” is likened to Crane’s energetic quest for meaning and symbol. In “The Poems of Our Climate,” Stevens’s desire to reduce poetry to essential terms, and then his countering resistance to this impulse, are explored. Finally, “The Man on the Dump” is considered as a typically Stevensian search for truth in specifically linguistic terms.Wallace Stevens, “The Poems of Our Climate,” 1942. From the Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens by Wallace Stevens, copyright (c) 1954 by Wallace Stevens and renewed 1982 by Holly Stevens. Reprinted by permission of Alfred A. Knopf, a division of Random House, Inc., New York.",": On Wednesday, I would like you to come having read one of Stevens’s longer poems. As you read it, think about images that you find in the poem of stars, of the theater, of mother and father; the poem is full of both. Marianne Moore, I think, in many ways is a happy poet. But no poet is so happy as Wallace Stevens. Stevens is a comic poet in the sense, in the generic sense of a poet in whom and for whom and with whom the world always comes right. And there’s a way in which Stevens’s poems are both creating a new space in which to speak, and they’re speaking from there. Stevens also says in that set of “Adagia” – and there are wonderful, provocative ones throughout, “A poem is a pheasant,” for one – he also says, “Poetry is a means of redemption.” Of course, it’s gone on but in a different form from what it had been. And there’s an aspect of Stevens that’s gendered as feminine, you could say. In this poem, I think, well, possibly warding off the anxiety of identifying poetry so clearly and strongly with the female, Stevens includes in stanza seven, on pages 239 to 240, a kind of parodic celebration of masculinity:Supple and turbulent, a ring of men Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn Their boisterous devotion to the sun, Not as a god, but as a god might be, Naked among them, like a savage source. Paradise, if it is to exist on earth, must include death in it. Of that wide water, inescapable,” where that wide water that was first introduced to us in the first stanza of the poem, becomes a kind of image for a silence in the world, which is the silence of a lack of, I think, divine language. Stevens is here trying to image for us a non-transcendental, secular vision of the world. This is Stevens exploring another version of secularity, of the secular, giving us a poetry it seems, as he starts, not of ideas but of things, as Williams might approve. These values that emerge in this poem are, well, recurrent in Stevens. And the dump is an image of this, which Stevens confronts here with a certain kind of irritation, playful but not so far, I think, from despair. Where was it one first heard of the truth?

Early publications of poems are discussed as they appeared in small magazines such as , , and . Book publication of the same poems and other poetry collections are then discussed in contrast. A number of modern English poets are presented such as Eliot, Hughes, Moore, Yeats, and photographs are shown in order to introduce students to the major poets of the early twentieth century.",": Now, this is not only a course for English majors, but for other majors too. My lectures are going to presume no special knowledge on your part. We’ll be studying several poets in some detail. There are two papers, a shorter and a slightly longer one. Well, very often they were big – big in format and size. meant to make a clean sweep of things, a clean sweep of what had come before. This is October 1922, comes out just before  is created. This is , author William Butler Yeats, the year 1899, on the verge of the new century. That’s part of the work and part of the subject and part of what I will be talking about here. Pound’s descent into infamy and insanity and indignity and Eliot’s rise to the extraordinary cultural power and prestige that he occupied and that is represented by this and many other photos, well, these are key stories in modern poetry and they’re interestingly interlocking, just as their two lives were. I won’t sing for you or give you my Italian, but these famous lines, “London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down” and so on, these come from the conclusion to . Coming to the metropolis a hundred or ninety years ago now entailed, for the writers that we’ll be reading, as much as for anyone else, a kind of break with a world that they had known, a break either with a native language – this is what the emigrant or the expatriate experiences – or perhaps with native ways of speaking and knowing, familiar spheres of reference. This is a photo by another American photographer, Walker Evans, a photo of Brooklyn Bridge. He says in , he asks the bridge to lend a myth to God, and he suggests that this is something that every age must do because our names for God are always metaphors, poems, something imagined, acts of speech. For Stevens, when modernity takes away God what it does is unveil the poet’s Godlike powers, a power to create the world through imagination, imagination which created God in the first place. The relativity of truth, the profusion of languages, these things that afflict Eliot are a source of faith for Stevens. And these are suggested, I’ll suggest briefly, by the last two poets we’ll read – W. H. Auden, to begin with here, pictured as an Oxford undergraduate, ever cheeky, who has written on the side of his photo, “The cerebral life would pay,” dry, cool, pragmatic; and Elizabeth Bishop, young in this glamorous George Platt Lynes photo."
420,english,engl-310,lecture-20,"Marie Borroff guest-lectures on Wallace Stevens’s late seasonal poem, “The Auroras of Autumn.” The poem is considered sequentially, beginning with Stevens’s mythology of the three serpents in section one and concluding with an examination of the beauty of the world, as Stevens conceives of it, in sections eight through ten. The poet’s optimism and fundamental belief in the power of imagination to divest death of its power is repeatedly demonstrated. The poem’s final sections are shown to exemplify characteristically Stevensian conceptions of peace and happiness in the face of death.Wallace Stevens, “Gubbinal,” 1950; “The Aurora’s of Autumn,” 1950 by Wallace Stevens, copyright © 1954 by Wallace Stevens and renewed 1982 by Holly Stevens. Reprinted by permission of Alfred A. Knopf, a division of Random House, Inc., New York.",": I have in the chairman’s office down the hall two photographs. You don’t stick with one; you don’t have a definitive one that is it. As he walked, he would write poems, poems would come to him. Fears of my bed, Fears of life and fears of death, Run away. You’ll hear about forsythia; you’ll hear about yellow and the blue sky. And that threat comes into the poem and is faced in the poem. Clearly there he is talking about the dawning of stars at night, “eyes open and fixed on us in every sky.” And then, we go to a single man who is always the vehicle of the imagination. Now, we move to something else, and what we move to in the next few sections are myths, large-scale myths: first the myth of the mother, the earth mother, let’s say, or the sky mother; the mother as nurturing, as warm, as tender; the mother who could perhaps be symbolized by summer, by a balmy, beneficent summer day, or by the warmth of the sun on a summer day. Then we get the father, the myth of the father, and this is the kind of, well, let’s say the Jove-like or Zeus-like being: the man who presides over the heavens. She makes that gentler that can gentle be. A wind will spread its windy grandeurs round And knock like a rifle-butt against the door. Section four, “Farewell to an idea…” Leave the mother behind; we’ve had her. This is a superhuman drama that is being played, and the father is inviting them. What company In masks can choir it with the naked wind?How can we celebrate? Or, the persons act one merely by being here. This is nothing until in a single man contained, Nothing until this named thing nameless is And is destroyed. When the leaves are dead, Does it take its place in the north and unfold itself, Goat-leaper, crystalled and luminous, sitting In highest night?Here – and I have no time to go into this aspect of the poem, which is another one like the theater and then the  allusions that I think are there – this is part of the astronomical motifs in the poem. The affirmation of innocence that comes to the speaker in section eight arises, in a sense, from all that has gone before; that is, from the myth-making of the early sections because, as we think back on them, it’s obvious that Stevens’s overarching myths, his great cosmic myths – the mother, the father, the celestial imagination that imagines the whole world and the passage of the zodiac – none of that has anything to do with revealed religion or particularly with the Christianity that we, most of us, know so much about. Now, I’m going to read toward the end of section eight:So, then, these lights [these lights are the Aurora Borealis, which he’s referred to by the phrase “these lights” several times in the poem] are not a spell of light, A saying out of a cloud, but innocence. As you remember in , there’s something rotten in the state of Denmark. Death is almost as a part of innocence, almost as the tenderest and truest part. The cosmic imagination meditates the whole thing, the history of humanity, and all of our fates. The splendors of the aurora have come to that, “by theses lights, / like a blaze of summer straw, in winter’s nick.”"
421,english,engl-310,lecture-21,"The late poetry of Wallace Stevens is presented and analyzed. Stevens’s conception of the poet as reader and the world as a text to be read and translated is considered in “Large Red Man Reading” and “The Poem that Took the Place of a Mountain.” The poet’s preoccupation with natural cycles and sensory experience is exhibited in “The Plain Sense of Things.” Finally, “A Primitive Like an Orb” is interpreted as Stevens’s final vision of ceaseless change and transition in the world, in which the poet’s verbal play participates.Wallace Stevens, “The Poem that Took the Place of a Mountain,” 1954; “The Plain Sense of Things,” 1954 and “Not Ideas about the Thing but the Thing Itself,” 1954.

Knopf, a division of Random House, Inc., New York.","Late Stevens, Stevens after World War Two, in the late ’40s and early 1950s at the end of his life. Stevens wants not an alternative to religion but, as he says, a substitute for it; in particular, a substitute for the solutions religion gives to death. “ The suggestion is that the poet’s utterance, which is something that sounds, it sounds in the ear, is a kind of decoding of the primary text of the world, suggesting that the world is a kind of poem, something that can be and must be read in just the same way that we read poems on the page. He represents, as I say, a general human capacity. He has many defenses against the obvious danger of being a poet of sentiment, that is, sentimentality. There’s continually a kind of acute self-consciousness. There it was, word for word, The poem that took the place of a mountain. That’s that interesting phrase that the poem begins with. It suggests that the poem that Stevens is talking about is, in some sense, a transcription or translation, word for word, which suggests in turn that the world was, even before it was put into language, already a kind of language, a set of words, a text. And there’s that word “sense” again, in all of its multiple senses.] At the earliest ending of winter [and now it’s not the end of fall but rather the end of winter that Stevens is writing about], In March, a scrawny cry from outside [and that’s a wonderfully resonate phrase – outside the room, outside the mind] Seemed like a sound  in his mind. The sun was rising at six, No longer a battered panache above snow… It would have been outside. Stevens, in describing it through metaphors and similes and finding words for it, is performing an act of reading again, of transcription, and of translation. The poem’s linguistic play, in other words, displays the poet’s power to link the things of the world through sound, to produce connections between them through words, and is itself a kind of model and a case of those choral rings through which the world is coming into being. The question in this poem, which is in your RIS packet, is really the same question as is posed by “Not Ideas About the Thing…” and that is: what is the relationship between Stevens’s poem and the poems of the world? The light Of it is not a light apart, up-hill. Here, man is not created in God’s image, but rather this image is of God created in man’s, brought into being through play and through all the senses of sense, representing a “definition with an illustration” – a picture in word: again, abstract and concrete, an aesthetic whole that includes a kind of philosophical knowledge in it.

422,english,engl-310,lecture-22,"This lecture presents the early poetry of W.H. Auden. In “From the Very First Coming Down,” Auden’s relationship to the reader is considered, as well as the role of economy, truth, and morality in his poetics. The political Auden is examined in “Spain” and “September 1, 1939,” along with his later practice of revising controversial poems. Finally, his interest in traditional forms, his vision of love, and his characteristic perspectivism, are explored in “This Lunar Beauty” and “As I Walked Out One Evening.”W.H. Auden, “This Lunar Beauty,” 1930; “Lullaby,” 1937 and “As I Walked Out One Evening,” 1940. Used by permission of Curtis Brown, Ltd.","There really is no more dramatic contrast in this course, I think, than to go from late Stevens to early Auden. From the very first coming down Into a new valley with a frown [already we’re listening to a poet who rhymes] Because of the sun and a lost way, You certainly remain [there’s a “you” here, there’s an “I.” The poem is a kind of letter and, in fact, a kind of love letter]: to-day I, crouching behind a sheep-pen [and this is that Northern landscape that Auden comes from], heard Travel across a sudden bird, Cry out against the storm, and found The year’s arc a completed round And love’s worn circuit re-begun, Endless with no dissenting turn. And we’re invited into that reticence, as well as the poet’s scruple, expressed here as the wisdom of that country god, which – it’s hard to know exactly how we’re supposed to interpret that, whether that’s an actual figure or a kind of stone in the landscape that the poet is animating in this way: but in any case, seeing that figure, that country god as emblematic of a reticence that scruples not “to say more than it meant.” Auden writes against vatic, romantic inspiration. Rather, there’s a sense that all these forms are simply available. And all of this is part of, in his early poetry, what you would have to call his precocious adultness, his knowingness which is, again, connected to his will to tell the truth, to tell the truth unclouded by sentiment. And both of these are properties of the poems and they make Auden a special kind of love poet. To be living here is to be mortal and guilty. Time here is not so much a kind of emblem of human inconstancy, but rather of something like natural law, to which everyone is subject. The lover, when he speaks, well, the poem seems to say or seems to acknowledge he’s lying, even if he doesn’t know it or mean to. And the clocks speak from the point of view of disenchantment. The domestic includes tragic and uncanny dimensions. In this way Auden, like Bishop whom we’ll read next week, is a poet constantly drawing our attention to matters of perspective: how things are seen, how things are framed, what the context of any given point of view or utterance or action is."
423,english,engl-310,lecture-23,"In this second lecture on W.H. Auden, the relationship between art and suffering is considered in Auden’s treatment of Brueghel’s “Fall of Icarus” in the poem “Musée des Beaux Arts.” Auden’s reflections on the place of art in society are explored in the elegies “In Memory of W.B. Yeats” and “In Memory of Sigmund Freud,” where Freud’s “talking cure” is recast as a model for poetry-making. Finally, “In Praise of Limestone” is considered as a late allegorical vision of a secular, non-transcendental earthly paradise.","I was reading last time from poems from the ’30s, those love poems: “Lay Your Sleeping Head, My Love,” and “This Lunar Beauty.” It is collected though in this book called , a book Auden published in 1940. We have here two different photographs of boys, boys who are classified here as “soldiers” and “civilians” and then grimly are identified as “with legs” and “without.” And here is another illustration of this general point I wanted to make. Suffering, in other words, was on his mind, and it’s the subject, or rather, art’s relation to suffering is the subject of this poem. I think one idea that is worth emphasizing is the way in which the ploughman, in Auden’s account as in Brueghel’s painting, has prominence, has a greater prominence than the heroic, romantic figure plunging into the sea. But in the importance and noise of to-morrow  When the brokers are roaring like beasts on the floor of the Bourse, And the poor have the sufferings to which they are fairly accustomed, And each in the cell of himself is almost convinced of his freedom; A few thousand will think of this day As one thinks of a day when one did something slightly unusual. This is an attempt to, in some sense, place poetry realistically in culture. And Auden himself is writing in America from a similar point of view. It is a technique of unsettlement that is a threat to princes, all worldly authority, because it questions authority and empowers the individual speaker to take life into his hands. Like Dante or like Pound’s Ulysses in , like the poet at the end of the Yeats elegy, Freud, in Auden’s poem, goes down among the lost people and goes into “the stinking fosse,” which is a powerful word. It reaches back, in that sense, in cultural history to suggest that our present misery is one with, continuous with, that of the past. They are, like Freud:…exiles who long for the future That lies in our power. It is an image of the world without another transcendental world beyond or behind it."
424,english,engl-310,lecture-24,"The early poetry of Elizabeth Bishop is discussed. The poet is positioned as an endpoint to modernism, and in her essay “Dimensions for a Novel,” a response to Eliot’s “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” Bishop is shown to transfer Eliot’s concept of “tradition” to the construction of literary works. The poem “The Map” is presented as an expression of Bishop’s early thinking about geography and world-making. “The Gentleman of Shalott” is considered as a contemplation of the process of perception. Finally, “Sandpiper” is read as a meditation on the challenges of locating coherence in a shifting world.“The Map,” 1935 “Sandpiper,” 1962 and excerpts from: “The Gentleman of Shalott,” 1936. Copyright (c) 1979, 1983 by Alice Helen Methfessel. Reprinted by permission of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, LLC.",": Frost was born in 1879, I think; Hart Crane in 1899, representing almost another generation from Frost. Bishop, in a sense, belongs to poetry after modern poetry, poetry after modernism. In 1929, I think, she interviewed the important guest on the campus, T. S. Eliot. And you could look at Eliot’s own poetry in, for example, “Prufrock” as exemplifying something of what Bishop is describing, that is, a poem that unfolds, disclosing at every point new principles of order and perspective. Bishop is, in many ways, a Stevensian poet, a poet of change, constant change. It’s a perceptual poetics that she’s concerned with, something she calls “geography” or sometimes “travel. Shadows, or are they shallows, at its edges showing the line of long sea-weeded ledges where weeds hang to the simple blue from green. These are important qualities of Bishop’s writing, although to highlight them is to risk a sort of misperception; that is, if Bishop presents herself as a kind of rational, considering intelligence in these poems, what she very rapidly uncovers is fantasy and the fantastic or fabulous or metaphorical. This is very much an image of, a poetics of a mind in action, a mind thinking. She turns back on it, asks questions about it. The opposition that she ends with is the one between the historian and the mapmaker. Bishop presents herself as engaged in a poetics of geography and of mapmaking that is more delicate than that of the historian. The opposition between the mapmaker and the historian: well, it would be too simple to call it an opposition between woman and man, and yet gendered terms are there in Bishop’s language, I think. Bishop’s character is a kind of dandy, like Prufrock. Well, I’ll leave you to ponder it, but I think that one way to understand her joke here – I’m not going to write about the lady of Shalott, I’m going to write about the gentleman of Shalott – one way to understand her joke here is to suggest that this poem is in part about what it means for Bishop to be a woman poet, and it implies that that meant for her a certain kind of gender switch, a sex change, and one that might introduce a certain amount of stress, as well as comedy. And they’re rhymed, but they’re rhymed in a most interesting and playful way. But while it stays put  he can walk and run and his hands can clasp one another.

425,english,engl-310,lecture-25,"In the final lecture of the course, Elizabeth Bishop’s “Over 2,000 Illustrations and a Complete Concordance” is considered with an emphasis on Bishop’s ambivalence towards the notion of home. The idea that modernists use poetry to do the work that religion no longer does is reflected upon, and connections are drawn between Bishop, Frost, Eliot, Stevens, and Crane. Bishop’s “Visits to St. Elizabeth’s” is considered as a formal rebuke to the ambitions of modernism alongside Auden’s statement that “poetry makes nothing happen” but ultimately the two poets are shown to offer poetry as a solution to modern alienation in its capacity to renew human community through communication.“Over 2000 Illustrations and a Complete Concordance,” 1955 and “Visits to St. Elizabeths,” 1950 from THE COMPLETE POEMS 1927-1979 by Elizabeth Bishop. Copyright (c) 1979, 1983 by Alice Helen Methfessel. Reprinted by permission of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, LLC.",": Today I’m going to try to talk a little bit more about Elizabeth Bishop, and I’m also going to try to give some big perspectives on the poets we’ve been reading and also some ways of thinking about how they fit together. Let’s look at Bishop’s poem, “Over 2,000 Illustrations and a Complete Concordance,” the poem placed second in her second book called , published in 1955 – the latest poems that we’ll discuss in this course. We glimpsed them, reddish, leaping up the cliffs among the fog-soaked weeds and butter-and-eggs. But notice how in this light, the sacred is secularized. Modern poetry is a poetry of the city, of the metropolis, of the world city, and of the place where the world’s peoples, goods, languages, traditions and cultures are all “accessible,” to use Marianne Moore’s word from her poem “New York.” There is an anti-modern strain in Frost just as there is in Yeats and, more complexly, in Pound and in Eliot. What’s modern about Frost is what has changed in the rural cultures that he writes about; that is, the collapse of farming economies and communities and the decay of nineteenth-century Protestantism, the white church on the village green. This is, in Frost, a conscious rewriting, I think, partially even a send-up as well as a competition with Eliot in  and the Grail myths that are one of the central motifs of that poem: one of the central motifs that embody for Eliot a sense of the holy, which is present, however, for Eliot only through literary allusion, something fascinating but unavailable as actual experience; something available only, in a sense, as quotation. Her poetry is written from the disturbingly and disorientingly decentered point of view that we find already in those early poems of hers, a point of view that takes for granted the absence of central authority that religion once provided. You see different versions of both of these impulses in the career trajectories of H.D. and William Carlos Williams, who begin as masters of a certain kind of short poem and go on to create epic poems of cultural sweep – H.D.’s being called , Williams’s .But the poet who more than any embodies these two impulses in the shape of his career is Pound, of course: as I said, the author of the shortest and the longest poem in modern poetry, the exponent of Imagism, and the author of . Remember Auden’s stone god “that never was more reticent, / always afraid to say more than he meant. Other modern poetry is experimental in a very different way, indeed in its revival and recovery and incorporation of historical poetic forms. This is the time of the tragic man that lies in the house of Bedlam. Here, Bishop gives us multiple perspectives on Pound and by extension on the social and political ambitions of modernist poetry."
426,english,engl-310,lecture-2,"The poetry and life of Robert Frost are characterized in opposition to the works of nineteenth-century poets and Modernists Eliot and Pound.  Frost’s poetic project, how he positions himself among his contemporaries, his poetics of work, and his concept of “the sound of sense” are discussed.  The poems “Mowing” and “ ‘Out, Out–’” are interpreted, and the tensions between vernacular language and poetic form that they showcase are explored.“Provide, Provide” and “Out, Out–” from THE POETRY OF ROBERT FROST edited by Edward Connery Lathem.

Reprinted by permission of Henry Holt and Company, LLC.",": I imagine that you all have images of Robert Frost and actual images in your mind when you think of this poet. And a kind of, well, kindly and monumental, and yet approachable figure that is familiar from American school rooms. It, too, is published in London, this time on Bloomsbury Street. He uses it very often by concealing it, in fact. That’s the obvious Frost, the one that the subtle Frost in many ways constructed, aiming all the time not at a general reader at all but at an elite reader of the new tiny-circulation, Little Magazines where the work of Eliot, Williams, Stevens, Moore and others were first published; those magazines I showed you last week, magazines like  or  or  or .There’s duplicity in Frost’s poetry, and there’s a certain doubleness in the figure that he projects as a poet. Poetry was a way for Frost out of manual labor but it was also a form of work for Frost that was opposed to manual labor. This is a monologue by a worker, a mower. If you look on page 213 in your , well, I’ll read from the middle of the poem. The whisper is not, Frost specifies, a “dream of the gift of idle hours.” Frost is also here specifically writing against the early poetry of Yeats, which you’ll read next week, poetry that finds reality exactly in “dream,” and that has plenty of fairies and elves in it. The truth is something that you get down to. These are words you’re not supposed to use in poems or in even writing about poems. What Frost gives you here and elsewhere is a poetry that leaves its meanings to make, all the time. Well, let me use this poem as a way into now talking about sound in more actual, more literal ways in Frost’s poetry and to begin with you to think a little bit about meter, in fact, and what Frost does with it. Let me go back to the handout where we’ve got more passages from Frost’s letters, and in particular what Frost has to say about something he calls “the sound of sense”; although he says in that first quotation that, well, he doesn’t like to brag. It represents common and vernacular elements of speech. The speaking voice, by contrast, is something idiosyncratic, irregular, particular.

427,english,engl-310,lecture-3,"In this second lecture on the poetry of Robert Frost, the poet’s use of iambic pentameter in “Birches” is discussed.  Frost’s anti-modernity is evidenced in his interest in rural New England culture and his concern with the lives of laborers in “Home Burial.”  The failure of humanity to work real change is sardonically depicted in “Provide, Provide,” but a hopeful vision of the power of imagination is presented in the final lines of the late poem, “Directive.”“Provide, Provide” and “Out, Out–” from THE POETRY OF ROBERT FROST edited by Edward Connery Lathem. Copyright 1916, 1969, copyright 1964 by Lesley Ballantine, copyright 1936, 1944 by Robert Frost. Reprinted by permission of Henry Holt and Company, LLC.",": We talked on Monday about Frost’s idea of “the sound of sense” and vernacular speech forms, his wish to put these in tension or, as he put it, “strained relation” with metrical pattern. these are all simple iambic phrases that you hear in our language all the time. And, yet, think about the qualities of sound that are so different between “across the lines of straighter darker trees” and “I like to think some boy’s been swinging them.” Frost’s ways of using language in short are like – are versions of the boy’s way of using the trees. So was I once myself a swinger of birches. One could do worse than be a swinger of birches. The skill and the play that Frost is talking about depend on being able to use the tool – in this case the tree, emblematic of the world in its sturdy but also delicate materiality – to use the tool to return safely to the ground to get your feet back on the ground. I don’t know where it’s” – love – “likely to go better,” and then, “I’d like to go by climbing a  tree.” Frost is a kind of materialist, by which I mean he calls attention to the circumstances of imagination, its limits and conditions. The work of poetry in Frost, really the high drama of the will at work in the world, is something that we can actually hear in his poetry, in the expertly explored tensions between speech and meter. It’s important for thinking about Frost’s place in modern poetry. These are, in a sense, complementary images of the modern in America. The poverty of the people Frost writes about is important. She took a doubtful step and then undid it To raise herself and look again. “I will find out now – you must tell me, dear.” Think of it, talk like that at such a time!”But in fact, in his own way, he’s talking about his inability to keep his child alive there; in a kind of metaphorical way, speaking of his failure to build a fence to last. If need be, occupy a throne, Where nobody can call  crone. A poem published after the Second World War, written about the post-war world. Back out of all this now too much for us, Back in a time made simple by the loss Of detail, burned, dissolved, and broken off Like graveyard marble sculpture in the weather, There is a house that is no more a house…And that is where he’s going to take us in the poem. Then for the house that is no more a house…And so on. At the end of the poem, here, Frost gives us, however, a kind of alternative to this image of the failure of the home and the failure of the worker’s life, in our own imaginative access to a spring, a source, above the house that was the water of the house that nurtured it, that was its refreshment."
428,english,engl-310,lecture-4,"The early poetry of William Butler Yeats is read and interpreted with particular attention paid to Yeats’s ambitions as a specifically Irish poet.  Yeats’s commitment to a poetry of symbol is explored in “The Song of the Wandering Aengus,” a fable of poetic vocation. “A Coat,” composed at the end of Yeats’s struggle to bring about an Irish national theater, shows the poet reconceiving his style and in search of a new audience. ”The Fisherman” is read as a revision of “The Song of the Wandering Aengus” which reflects this new set of concerns.",": For Wednesday – This is my – our first Yeats lecture. This is Yeats in costume, costumed as a figure from Irish myth, as an ancient bard, mad King Goll, which is the furthest thing from a modern poet. His poetry is, in fact, deeply autobiographical, but it doesn’t necessarily help to know that because his life is not a reliable key for reading the poems, exactly because he treated his life as art, raising the particulars of his experience into general symbols, working the narrative of his life into myth. In a certain sense, Yeats, I think, really felt that he was King Goll. King Goll is a mythical Irish ruler who goes mad in the heat of battle. His ambition is to become the first major Irish poet writing in English. Yeats’s early poetry has those aspects of song as its aim. Yeats publishes “King Goll” in , and Frost mocks the ideal of poetry as the “dream of the gift of idle hours”; he mocks the idea of poetry as “easy gold at the hand of fay or elf” in “Mowing” –characters that come right out of early Yeats. Yeats once said that he wanted the natural words in the natural order, but he had a very highly cultured sense of what is natural, and his poetry is full of verbal archaism. When Aengus or Yeats pursue their desires, the object of desire – that is, when they pursue a kind of hoped for unity of being that the merging with the beloved would constitute – this carries them out of the natural world into a realm of high art, of symbols. It will be expressed in a rhetoric of nakedness, or what Yeats will also call “coldness. It suggests both the difference between the earlier Yeats and the middle Yeats, but also, importantly, the kinds of continuity between them, the ways in which Yeats remained very much the same poet. Contrast this place, this way of imagining Ireland, what Ireland means, with the sensual landscape of Aengus, with the unreality of the world of that earlier poem. ”The poetry that Yeats wants from this place, the place that the fisherman takes him to, it’s going to be cold and passionate, as he describes it. The poem identifies also cold and passion with dawn, the moment of awakening, which is also a moment of coming into reality from dream and sleep."
429,english,engl-310,lecture-5,"Yeats’s middle period is explored, beginning with the middle-aged Yeats’s assumption of the role of spokesman for Irish nationalism and the development of his complicated response to nationalist violence. The aestheticization of violence is considered in the poem “Easter, 1916” and briefly in “The Statues.” Yeats’s conception of the relationship of violence to history, with particular emphasis on the frightening interaction among the divine, the human, and the bestial, is demonstrated in the visionary poems “The Second Coming” and “The Magi,” and finally in “Leda and the Swan.”W.B. Yeats, “Leda and the Swan,” 1924. Used by permission of A P Watts Ltd on behalf of Gráinne Yeats.",": In our first Yeats lecture, I was talking about Yeats’s early development and stylistic transformation over the course of, roughly, a twenty-, twenty-five year period. The little poem, “A Coat,” that poem about that stylistic transformation about the enterprise of walking naked, well, it’s a poem that reminds us that Yeats’s development was, as he understood it, conditioned by his relationship to his audience. Yeats is a very different writer and has a different relation to the world of Joyce’s , for example. He says:I have met them at close of day Coming with vivid faces From counter or desk among grey Eighteenth-century houses. Motley” signifying their Irishness, as if Yeats and these men and women he speaks of shared only their Irishness.]In the second strophe of this poem he proceeds to talk about, to isolate individuals, particular figures of the revolt, which your editor identifies at the bottom of the page. By “all,” that three letter word, a highly Yeatsian word, a word Yeats loves to use – you’ll see him use it often – Yeats means “all of them,” “all of those people,” “all the people I’ve been describing.” And Easter is an important resonance here, obviously. He sees, specifically, the passion of the revolutionary’s act and he finds it beautiful. This is really moving poetry, remarkably so. Pearse is seen as, in Yeats’s poetry and in popular lore, as Cuchulain, as a kind of avatar of the mythic Irish hero. It isn’t necessary for you to grasp his occultism in order to read his poetry well. Yeasts suggests that we think of this historical moment as the Second Coming. But this is not the return of Jesus that Christianity prophesizes. That’s “The Magi”; again, a visionary poem where Yeats is saying, “I see, I see in my mind’s eye.” Being so caught up, So mastered by the brute blood of the air, Did she put on his knowledge with his power Before the indifferent beak could let her drop?History, what makes history happen, is imaged here in the form of the rape of the human by the divine in the form of a beast, the form of a swan."
430,english,engl-310,lecture-6,"Yeats’s late poetry is discussed and interpreted. The poet’s interest in human knowledge and its relationship to the body, particularly the aging body, is traced from “Leda and the Swan” to “Sailing to Byzantium,” “In Memory of Eva Gore-Booth and Con Markievicz,” “Two Songs from a Play,” and “Vacillation.” Yeats’s late interest in the experiences of joy, madness, and “gaiety” is examined in “Crazy Jane Talks with the Bishop.” Yeats’s de-mystifying attitude toward art in “The Circus Animals’ Destruction” is contrasted with his celebration of art in “Lapis Lazuli.”W.B. Yeats, “In Memory of Eva Gore-Booth and Con Markiewicz,” 1929 and “Crazy Jane Talks with the Bishop,” 1933. Used by permission of A P Watts Ltd on behalf of Gráinne Yeats.","On your handout I have Yeats on the subject of magic. He also speaks of his belief “in the power of creating magical illusions, in the visions of truth in the depths of the mind when the eyes are closed; and I believe in three doctrines,” which he will conveniently put forward for us:(1) That the borders of our mind  can be evoked by symbols. [ And this is related to Yeats’s idea that the poet – and this is something he wrote about in the prose I asked you to read for today – that the poet is more type than man. But also, I think, embodied because it is specifically a thing of the body and involves an experience of the body, as much as, or more than, the mind. In the late Yeats, in the poems that I’ll be discussing today, there’s no knowledge apart from the body. Late Yeats: this is a poetry written in age and written about age and aging; age seen and experienced as the failure and corruption of the body, to which the soul is bound. In your RIS packet, I gave you the short poem “Two Songs from a Play.” But just as in Frost, this strategy isn’t going to work. These are antinomies that the poem is exploring. She speaks what Yeats calls in his general title for this group of poems . “A woman can be proud and stiff When on love intent; But Love has pitched his mansion in The place of excrement; For nothing can be sole or whole That has not been rent.” The Bishop claims one side of debate, Jane claims the other. And the bestial is identified in Yeats with the heart and with the irrational and with the uncontrollable. Here, Yeats presents us with an image of art in the form of a lapis lazuli Chinese carving, and he describes the figures on that carving, who are in some sense representatives of an attitude, again, beyond tragedy, beyond the kinds of social and political apocalypse that Yeats faced in his career and that he describes also in this poem.

431,english,engl-310,lecture-7,"A representative sample of English poetry of World War One is surveyed. War rhetoric and propaganda are examined and challenged in Wilfred Owen’s “Dulce et Decorum Est” and “Strange Meeting.” The relationship between home front and battle front is explored in Thomas Hardy’s “Channel Firing,” “In the Time of ‘the Breaking of Nations,’” and “I Looked up From My Writing”; Edward Thomas’s “Adlestrop”; and Siegfried Sassoon’s “ ‘Blighters.’” Isaac Rosenberg’s “Louse Hunting” is discussed as a poem of ordinary experience in the trenches.",": Let’s turn to page 527 in your anthology where you find a famous poem by Wilfred Owen called “Dulce et Decorum Est.” And your footnote explains that that phrase is the beginning of a line from Horace, completed at the end of the poem – that is, in the last lines of the poem – “pro patria mori”: translated as, “It is sweet and proper”; sweet and right, decorous – “to die for one’s country. If in some smothering dreams you too could pace Behind the wagon that we flung him in, And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin; If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, –  My friend, you would not tell with such high zest To children ardent for some desperate glory, The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est Pro patria mori. The power and authority, too, of Owen’s writing is, well, certified, we feel, by that first person that speaks to us, that “I” who speaks as a witness to war, as a describer, as someone telling a reader elsewhere what he has seen and speaking specifically for one fallen soldier. Most of the figures that we study are in fact Americans. I also think it’s important for us to think about the war as an important context when we go on to read Pound and Eliot, when we encounter in their poetry a sense of apocalyptic change, of civilization in crisis, which can seem pretty vague sometimes. This is a little pamphlet of war poems Hardy published in 1917 and that you can find in the Beinecke. He wrote his poems from the perspective of rural England. Hardy has various gothic and supernatural fancies that he asks us to imagine in vivid, homely terms.] The dead are raising their objections here to guns that will be used very shortly in the Great War. He begins writing under the influence of his friend, Robert Frost. Although I believe Thomas wrote the poem the year he enlisted but, I think, before his enlistment, you might feel as though Thomas is already on the train for France. In a sense it is an image of the English countryside at a moment in which it is being emptied out, its young men sent to France to die, a kind of no man’s land already. See gargantuan hooked fingers Pluck in supreme flesh To smutch supreme littleness. With a thousand pains that vision’s face was grained; Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground, And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan. ‘ Now men will go content with what we spoiled, Or, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled. I knew you in this dark: for so you frowned Yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed."
432,english,engl-310,lecture-8,"The Imagist school is defined, in part through the prose of Ezra Pound. Representative examples of Imagist poetry are examined, particularly Hilda Doolittle’s “Garden,” “Sea Rose,” and “Oread.” Pound’s early poem, “In a Station of the Metro,” and Pound’s comment on the poem’s composition are studied as Imagist statements. His work with foreign languages, particularly Chinese, is considered in relation to Imagism in the poems “Jewel Stairs’ Grievance” and “River Merchant’s Wife: A Letter.”",": Last Wednesday, talking about the poetry of World War I, we were talking about poems written in the period 1914 to 1918, pretty much the period of the First World War. And Pound put at the end of H. D.’s poems a new signature to them (“H. D.,” that is) and at the same time named the kind of poet she was (“Imagiste”) and promptly, since Pound is a great entrepreneur, sent the poems off to be published and to found a movement. Pound, despite Amy Lowell’s taking over of Imagism, remains the real theorist of Imagism and the one whose formulations we still return to in order to understand what Imagism was and, to an extent, to understand some of the essential aesthetic ideas and criteria of modern poetry. And here you can see him really trying to do so in this stress on objectivity or the aim or objectivity. Notice that the “thing” may be, as he says, “subjective or objective.” You can see her translation of Sappho’s fragment 68 on page 389. If I could break you I could break a tree. Here, and really in all these early poems, H. D.’s poems take place as a kind of lyric drama of apostrophe: that is, the act of address through which a speaker finds her voice by speaking in some relation to a part of the object world; speaking to a thing, which she identifies with or struggles against or both, as is the case, I think, in the poems I’ve just read. A speaker, in this case, who wishes to be covered up, to be subject to a greater force. Again, in Pound, as Pound thinks about these things, there’s a drive specifically through technique to arrive at a kind of transparency beyond technique. The key to this poem, as to other Poundian poems, is syntax. Pound takes Japanese and Chinese poetries as models for this aesthetics of compression. And yet, Pound’s taste for Japanese and Chinese art comes right out of Victorian decadence and – well, you can see this yourselves if you look at the paintings of James Whistler and others. And that’s what he’s really interested in getting at. Grievance, therefore there is something to complain of."
433,english,engl-310,lecture-9,"The lecture introduces the poetry of Ezra Pound. Tensions in Pound’s personality and career are considered, particularly in terms of his relationships with other poets and his fascism and anti-capitalism. The poem “The Seafarer” is examined as a quintessentially Poundian project in its treatment and translation of poetic forms. The first of his epic project, The Cantos, is analyzed as a meditation on the process of expressing and engaging with history and literary tradition.","How many of you have ever read Pound before? On the one hand, Pound was an individual of extraordinary personal charisma and force, someone who liked to, and who had the power to tell other people what to do, tell other people what to think and what to value. He’s someone who openly seeks alliance with others. And this is a letter from Pound which says about Crane’s poems: “It is all very egg. Ezra Pound, born in Hailey, Idaho in 1908. There, he became urgently concerned with economic reform, in the United States and in the West generally. Well, here is a poet who by his own declaration and example seems to be a Fascist sympathizer, an anti-Semite. And what he is entering, what he’s going to, he conceives as a particular kind of tradition, a kind of historical community, which he describes in that first quotation on your handout; a quotation in which Pound replies in a wonderfully haughty way to the motto of  magazine, a motto that comes from the great American poet Whitman: “To have great poetry, there must be great audiences, too.” Well, I asked you to read for class today one of Pound’s poems from the teens, one of his famous poems, a poem called “The Seafarer,” identified in your RIS packet as “From the Anglo-Saxon.” Pound is a distinctive and, in a sense, quite peculiar thing. On the other hand, in Pound and in others, the artist is a kind of legislator, to use Shelley’s image. Pound embodies these two drives, as I’m calling them, more clearly, better than anybody, and they’re part of his interest and power, and some of the challenge that he gives us, both aesthetic challenges and moral and political ones, as we think about his career. In that sense, a poem that is structurally unbounded. Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller, Thus with stretched sail, we went over sea till day’s end. And you can see, in other words, what Odysseus is doing now as he goes to the underworld and seeks prophetic speech from Tiresias as a version of what Pound is doing as he seeks to translate the Greek at the inception of his epic. In effect, if the poem began with “and,” it now ends with “so that,” where the colon is a kind of gateway through which the rest of the poem, and implicitly following Homer, the rest of history will pass."
434,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-10,"The lecture reviews water law in the United States, and highlights challenges inherent in regulating water quality. Aging water infrastructure, pesticide and herbicide application, and surface water runoff all pose challenges in maintaining a clean drinking water supply. The lecture covers pesticide management through the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The management of pesticides and herbicides in drinking water has been heavily influenced by the economic concerns of pesticide and herbicide users as well as the municipal water agencies charged with testing water regularly for regulated chemicals. The lecture concludes with the regulation history of atrazine, a commonly used herbicide that research has shown to be hormonally active.",": Today I want to talk about water and the law that surrounds drinking water, to talk about its quality, talk about what your rights are to clean water. You can only go for about four minutes without air. I’ll talk more about the monitoring system that is currently in place and why it’s deficient. There are many connectors in many cities that are quite old that are no longer allowed to be installed that connect the water main itself into your apartment or into your house. So for example, you certainly would not want to make a cup of tea by turning your hot water tap on and then putting a tea bag in the water. They’re not thoughtful about how chemicals can migrate long distances. And then I started looking at old air photos, wondering about former land uses. And a pattern started to emerge that in many areas that had been former agricultural lands, these had been developed into residential areas and wells had been dug into those areas and provided unregulated water supplies to almost a million people in the state of Connecticut. Well, it may mean that you need to conduct a brand new type of test. And the smaller the water system is, the more expense it’s going to allocate per individual household. So the sampling design relative to the rain events really proved to be extremely important to the findings. Its uses in the United States include food crops: field corn, sweet corn, sugar cane, sorghum, winter wheat, guava, macadamia nuts. My town is a good example, little town of Killingworth. So large circles, like the one around Texas, represent more than 8 million people. And by registered I mean it was given a license, it’s like a driver’s license. And I’ve had the experience of sitting on EPA scientific advisory panels for nearly a decade and reviewing new evidence of risk. They also used what they called a restricted-use classification. But then you get this overlap of the spray in the field. So the dance of regulation is one where the government will say, “Look, we’ve got to cut back your use, we have to protect the water or we want to reduce worker exposure.” It should ring a bell that you should be concerned about the quality of water in your tap and you should think carefully about the wisdom of using activated carbon at the tap, because it’s not likely that the government has kept it perfectly safe. I ran into this in California, when I found that a chemical, dibromochloropropane, that had been injected into the soil in cotton fields, had actually volatilized and gotten up into the fog. And climatologically, it’s interesting because a fog will settle on that area and stay there for a good part of January, sometimes December, six to eight weeks. And the concentration of atrazine in precipitation in some areas where it had not been applied, was one part per billion. So the degradation of the chemical in aquatic environments is increasingly of concern. The half-life is between forty-one and 237 days. And Lake Michigan is a repository for atrazine because of its use, particularly in Minnesota and Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, and the pattern of rainfall in that area. So atmospheric wet deposition is about 2,493 kilograms per year."
435,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-11,"This lecture presents three cases: , a lawsuit brought by peanut growers against the producers of a pesticide that degraded their soil; the Alar case, in which environmental organizations and the media successfully pressured EPA to ban a carcinogenic pesticide used on apples; and the Texas Cattlemen’s Association’s lawsuit against Oprah Winfrey for her coverage of Mad Cow Disease. Using these three cases, Professor Wargo discusses the legal concepts of preemption and defamation. He gives an overview of their origin and use in regulating agriculture and protecting human health and the environment. Through the Texas Cattlemen’s Association case, he shows the effect of state “veggie libel” laws on free speech.","And I wanted to remind you that next week, we’re moving on to air quality. And another is a case that was brought by the Texas Cattlemen’s Association against Oprah Winfrey. Should that information be on a warning label?Negligence is another theory for recovery. So was the product made in a negligent way or was it used in a negligent way? Listening to  today, I was intrigued by litigation that is growing, class action suits against Toyota because of their accelerator pad catching, or brake defects. So when did the corporation know that the pedals stuck or that the brake system was not working correctly?So the failure to report back to government agencies that have regulatory responsibilities, whether it’s pharmaceuticals or cars or pesticides or cosmetics or foods, these generally carry significant penalties. And we’ve been pointed to no evidence that such tort suits led to a crazy quilt of FIFRA (federal pesticide law standards) or otherwise created any real hardship for manufacturers or EPA.” Should corporations be capable of holding that as a secret? And it would also cause uniform ripening. So it also had the Food and Drug Administration that was interpreting the  standard to allow low levels of risk in the food supply. This is a report that was prepared on this controversy. While Dr. Moore blames a law which requires him to balance the health risks to the public against the economic benefits to the growers, Congressman Jerry Sikorsky blames the EPA.There are two laws. Think about the wording, the phrasing very carefully. It’s loaded with uncertainty from many different sources. These are statements of certainty that caused widespread fear in the population. Donahue, on , he said “Don’t look now, but we’re poisoning our kids.” So they needed to prove that the statements were made knowingly to be false, the statements were deliberately made to induce monetary damage. ”Well in this case, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found on the absence of human studies that “The fact that there had been no studies conducted specifically on the cancer risks to children form daminozide, one of the arguments on the part of the industry, does nothing to disprove the conclusion that if children consume more of a carcinogenic substance than do adults, they are at higher risk for contracting cancer.” And the burden of demonstrating the falsity rests on the plaintiff. These laws have been in place now for well over a decade, and all environmental groups, all public health interest groups understand the nature of these laws and they’re all very self-conscious about the nature of the claims that they make. Never again in that trial did they ever ask me about why I was a vegetarian. I’m on the stand, the lawyer looks at me and he says, “Mr. Lyman, has anybody ever called you irresponsible?” So under federal law, it’s really clear that the Cattlemen’s Association was under the burden of proof to demonstrate that the statement was knowingly false and delivered with malice with the intent to harm."
436,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-12,"The lecture describes the Clean Air Act and the way the federal government measures air quality as well as improvements in air quality. Professor Wargo reviews challenges in regulating air quality, reasons for lack of adequate enforcement, and approaches to setting ambient air quality standards. The lecture focuses predominantly on vehicle emissions, and the difficulty that regulators face when trying to decrease particulate matter expelled by cars. The public health impacts of poor air quality, particularly in urban areas, are discussed as well.",": Today, we’re going to embark on a discussion about air quality law. It’s about understanding the environment and how it works and how it responds to different kinds of human stresses. And as you look at the structure of the Clean Air Act, you’ll see that the idea, prevention of significant deterioration, is a really critical concept. Trans-boundary flows of pollution have been traditionally very difficult to control. So originally, EPA went after particulate matter ten, which is ten microns in diameter, in size, and had neglected anything that was finer. So just take PM 2.5, because we’re going be talking about that with respect to diesel emissions. Or sixty-five micrograms per cubic meter, as a yearly average. Well, they publish a notice in the federal register. And it categorized minor and major sources and put into place the maximum achievable control technology standard. Well, today for the next twenty, twenty-five minutes, what I want to do is I want to focus on vehicle emissions. So that one of the issues that we’re looking at is could we do something that would employ barges to move those containers so that it would avoid the adverse effects associated with trucking moving through the region, which is in part related to their climate influence, but also the really bad air quality in Connecticut surrounds the I-95 corridor and the I-91 interchange moving up toward Hartford. Those trucks, by the way, get about five to five and a half miles per gallon. So the finer particles are more dangerous. No consideration of the cost to the trucking industry or to the auto industry or to the utilities can be at play as EPA decides what the level is supposed to be. Severity of response is a function of whether or not you get routine care. So that this map of where the coal-fired power plants are located, this is an old map. So that we’re now burning sulfur fuel, diesel fuel, that’s about fifteen parts per million sulfur. We also burn diesel fuel in Connecticut especially because we don’t have a good natural gas source. So getting the sulfur out of the fuel is a more expensive process. So PM 10 is just about the limit of visibility, which is kind of curious, because most people think that diesel emissions are much cleaner than they used to be, that somehow we’ve managed to get rid of many of the smokers as EPA calls them with more efficient designs or with particle traps. And I asked one of the people in the class what the percentage of kids in his class was that had registered medications with the school nurse. And they would be people that were asthmatic, kids and adults, those with chronic bronchitis, those with emphysema, those with coronary heart disease and diabetes. So that the concept here is we have about thirty different stations set up with fixed monitoring. But you also see something else in this chart which I think is quite curious. You see a rise coming around the rush hour. The PM 2.5 standard demands that the data be averaged over twenty-four hour periods and then averaged over three years. So basically, the way that EPA would read data would be over this twenty-four hour average over three years."
437,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-13,"The lecture discusses developments in air quality monitoring and regulation in the United States, with an emphasis on regulating vehicle emissions. Monitoring takes place at fixed points with results being averaged over three years, and this data informs air quality standard setting. Studies have found that this form of monitoring underreports the amount of pollution that children and other susceptible populations (i.e. bus and truck drivers) are exposed to. Professor Wargo details ways in which individuals are exposed to heightened air pollution on a daily basis and the policy responses at the federal, state, and local levels.","So I wanted to continue talking about air quality today and air quality law. So when in interpreting the statutory text, Congress does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouse holes. And what you see is the coagulation between cells of the particulate matter, the carbon in those that are exposed at higher concentrations. And this is the area that is out of compliance. So I’ll tell you a bit more about that in just a moment. And each of those children, on average, spends an estimated 180 hours every year on board one of those buses. They tended to diminish during the school day. Another industry group, the Diesel Technology Forum, argues that the diesel engines now being produced are much cleaner than the diesel engines of the past, and that with proper maintenance, diesel school buses pose no threat to riders. Our consumer correspondent Greg Hunter joins us now. So you’re a parent, you see this, you want to do something, what? California has a little bit less than half of the hours or the total exposure than New York. So just one other thing that was interesting in terms of study design. In this case, we really didn’t understand whether or not the level of pollution that we were measuring was coming from inside the bus, from other traffic, or from other sources. So this idling issue prompted us to think well one no brainer as a policy response would be to try to get the bus drivers to shut their engines off while they were idling. So they’re burning fuel almost twenty-four hours and idling. But also, I think that the truck drivers’ exposure is really quite a serious issue. And I was really quite surprised, because they wanted to promote my work. So that on a day like this, you get many of the particles being rained out of the air. And it was also increasing the risk of injury from accidents at the schools. And they’ll hold that up against the sky and visually try to compare the darkness of the emissions to their chart to figure out whether or not they think that the truck is in compliance. And I had one superintendent tell me that she always knew when the buses were arriving, even though she was 250 yards away from where they were arriving on the other side of the complex because the air ventilation system was picking it up and redistributing it throughout the entire school. So that what’s coming out is a product of very low-temperature combustion which is perfect for the formation of dioxins and furans. So that also you could think about how pollution would kind of gather on the surface nearby, could gather on foods or vegetable gardens, but also kids playing in a sandbox. There is a lawsuit that is being considered by a group of those in the air force that were responsible for maintaining these trash pits. And the concentration of particulates in this area, because I’ve worked on wood smoke, if you can see wood smoke at this level, the particulate concentrations are likely to be in the many multiples above that fifteen microgram federal limit. And he lives in a valley and I live on the hill above the valley."
438,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-14,"Plastics are omnipresent but minimally understood and regulated in the United States. The lecture focuses on the dangers that chemicals in plastics pose to human health, particularly via leaching into food and water. Plastics are regulated by the Toxic Substance Control Act, which gives the Environmental Protection Agency the responsibility of testing to ensure that plastics do not adversely affect human health. When plastics can leach into food, the Food and Drug Administration can demand testing. Professor Wargo shows how oversights have led to limited labeling of hazardous plastics, which results in consumers having limited means of protecting themselves from harm.","Today I want to talk about what I think of as one of the most significant failures of environmental law in the twentieth century. There are plastic particles, molecules in ambient air outside and indoors. Polypropylene, you may find polypropylene in rugs. So PVCs are not recycled because the chemical content is so complicated. So the PETE bottles have roughly a twenty to twenty-five percent recycling rate on average in the United States. And I believe that today is a virtual impossibility. And I want you to think about the built environment. So that the exterior surfaces of this structure are predominately made out of plastic. And this is all for an interesting and really important purpose. So an average vehicle today might be 2,500 pounds, but an average vehicle perhaps forty years ago was perhaps 300 or 400 pounds more than that. Everybody is going to want to paint something a different color, and should we make the paints to be more stable or not quite as stable so that they would want to repaint after a certain number of years?”So just as another example, I’ve done this myself, I’ve refinished floors, which is a pretty nasty business. So that the number of surface coatings in the world is enormous in area, and we don’t really think about the long-term consequences of that. Could you not put a coating like polyurethane or varnish on walls like this? If something is rough and harsh then it has a negative attitude toward it. And increasingly, they are made out of plastic. And the ink, I mean obviously, the printer is formed predominately out of plastic or different kinds of plastics, including the electronics board. It was not required to be tested in a sufficient way by the Food and Drug Administration. And the next time you walk into a supermarket, I hope you walk down the aisles. And I want you to pay special attention and look particularly for products that are not wrapped in plastic or they’re not stored in plastic environments. Canned tomatoes, think about your dining hall, any of you work in the dining hall, think about the large cans that they have their food delivered within. Well, it’s kind of ironic that we take them out and we put them in a plastic trash bin. It’s found in outdoor air, which to me is really quite surprising. But this is really quite a comment on our neglect of chemicals and misunderstanding their movement through the environment and their ultimate fate. So why wouldn’t you find residues in the waste water?And for me in one way this is maybe the most disturbing, it’s in the rainwater, so that it’s detectable in rainwater just the same way that strontium-90 was detectable in rainwater. But we really haven’t thought about what it might mean for either our health or environmental quality. And I’ve mentioned this on occasions before, but not with respect to hormonally active compounds, where she discovered along with colleagues that exposure to a variety of pesticides that where hormonally active prevented calcium metabolism in eggshells. So what are we seeing out there in terms of fertility or diseases of reproduction in humans? Well, the government, the regulatory agencies tend to call in experts and get expert opinions. And its recycling percentage is close to zero. But here in Connecticut, we now have a statute on the books as of last year that requires that bisphenol-A be taken out of products that are intended to be used by young children. Again, very expensive, and a strategy that’s not likely to work."
439,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-15,"The lecture explores the development of scientific proof of the harm that tobacco poses to human health and the legal tools used to regulate its use. The government has used warnings, control over advertising, and age restrictions to regulate tobacco. The tobacco industry has been able to complicate efforts to impose stricter regulations on tobacco consumption due to its power in the media due to ad sales and government due to the importance of cigarette sales taxes to state governments.","So the midterms are graded, for those of you that are not doing the paper. The overwhelming majority of those cigarettes, by the way, are lit and smoked indoors so that this is very much an indoor air quality issue. In France, you need to be sixteen years old. So the American Tobacco Institute, for example, might be thought of similarly to the Atomic Energy Commission or to the pesticide companies that conducted their own analyses of data so that they became the source of data to demonstrate the absence of a clear understanding about adverse health effects. Also in advertising, they really took very bold moves — and I’ll go through a variety of different advertising strategies today with you — to associate tobacco use with the ideas of freedom, values of nature, also sociability and sexuality. If you look at the variability of taxation by state, it’s also quite curious. This is a twenty-two percent increase over previous years. So that expenditures for advertising have increased in response to an increase in regulation and these declining adopting rates. The idea of this series was modeled after a television show called , really modeled after James Bond and Don Johnson. Anybody that has smoked or knows smokers know that cigarettes generally stain teeth, especially those without filters. Top-billed actors lit up in fifty-nine percent of all movies reviewed. Another example of Virginia Slims advertising. What a brilliant advertising technique, recognizing the addictive power of tobacco, how few cigarettes it really takes to cause a physical addiction, and putting them into every K-Ration, virtually ensuring that you would have a high addiction rate among the GIs once the millions of soldiers came back to the U.S.Today, if you look on the internet, you’ll find a variety of different advertising schemes in different parts of the world. RJR Stir the Senses campaign is a good example. But the Canadians have taken a tougher stance than we have in the United States. Another example, cigarettes cause lung cancer. And also, Asians have one of the lowest adoption and addiction rates in the nation. In 1969, the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act was adopted, and it demanded a cautionary label with a key change in the phrase. They were in the multiple billion dollars per year. Additional private litigation has also gone on in different states against different corporations. And if yes, it should be regulated and possibly prohibited under the statute. He continued:“We are of the conviction that the ultimate explanation for the perpetuated cigarette habit resides in the pharmacological effect of smoke upon the body of a smoker. Think of a cigarette pack as a storage container for a day’s supply of nicotine…think of the cigarette as a dispenser for a dosed unit of nicotine… think of a puff of smoke as the vehicle for nicotine…smoke is beyond question the most optimized vehicle of nicotine…”So going back to these original transcripts of meetings held within the tobacco industry, Kessler felt that he had discovered yes, they believed that this was a drug."
440,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-16,"The lecture explores the development of scientific proof of the harm that tobacco poses to human health and the legal tools used to regulate its use. The government has used warnings, control over advertising, and age restrictions to regulate tobacco. The tobacco industry has been able to complicate efforts to impose stricter regulations on tobacco consumption due to its power in the media due to ad sales and government due to the importance of cigarette sales taxes to state governments.","I want to make a couple of announcements about readings for next week, just so that you all know where they are. There is an overlap obviously between the intensity of physical activity among the young, so that the youngest are most physically active. So all with an idea to manipulate the dose that the individual would get per cigarette. So that this eventually prompted Kessler, once he had all of this information derived from patents, but also derived from National Institute of Health independently-conducted research and recognizing that there was much research that had gone on in these companies that was disclosed to the Food and Drug Administration. So we had the right to make claims about our product and to sell it. And in this case, in 1998, the attorneys general from forty-six states signed this agreement with four of the biggest companies, tobacco companies, in the nation. So here you see three different institutional arenas basically considering the same issues. And you find the attorneys general using litigation as a way of forcing settlement so that you get the companies themselves to agree that they’re not going to do these things. Another settlement proved interesting, an occupational question as well. So there’s a tendency not to refresh that air. So that it’s important to recognize that these are debates about the nature and the language, the very specific language and definitions contained in the statutes that provide the authorizing language to the administrative agency, such as the Food and Drug Administration. So the tobacco companies have to disclose not just chemicals used for the growing of tobacco, but the chemicals in the tobacco plants themselves, whether or not they’re genetically modified, and what kinds of additives they placed, not just in the tobacco but in the filter as well as the paper. In Oregon, tobacco use fell eleven percent. A very different view evolved of what was risky and what was not. And it eventually led the public to realize that this was a technology, this was a product that demanded greater public attention. So once again, I’m not Dr. Doom and Gloom, I’m showing you examples in history that I think are really remarkable success stories, such as the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the Food Quality Protection Act, and in this case, the statute that was just passed. They argue that evidence is insufficient to justify regulation. The industry or proponent would trivialize claims of hazards and compare the hazards always to natural hazards. So the radionuclides in our milk are relatively insignificant. And this act of averaging, when you have a really — the image is really one of pockets of risk, the averaging is going to compress peoples’ perception of and the magnitude of the risk. They will always fight that if you take away the right to do what they did in the past that you have to compensate for them under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. You find this with pesticides, you find this with drugs. Make sure that you focus exclusively on our product because we don’t want the risk, the threat, the environmental damage from our product to be thought of an in an additive way with competitors’ products. So they will delay for the same reasons that industry would delay, saying that the evidence is insufficient to justify increased regulation. Think about how susceptibility varies in the population."
441,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-17,"By reviewing the conservation history of the Adirondack Park, this lecture examines strategies to manage land use and natural resources in protected areas. The Adirondacks has been protected since the 1880s and became a national park in the 1970s. The government manages the park for a variety of uses, including recreational, ecological, and natural resource-related uses. The multiple uses of the park create conflict amongst stakeholders and require regulations that prevent certain types of development. The lecture reviews regulations and zoning ordinances that protect public lands.","First, thank you for coming out on such a blustery day. If you have not picked up your exam from your teaching fellow, you can do that after class today. One is first to become familiar with property rights. And noncompliance means that you’re going to have extensive surveillance and monitoring costs and enforcement costs. But they would be visible from nearby wilderness areas. So this is a very rigorous standard that is hard to change. These were new and very interesting thoughts to people. It wasn’t designed really to conserve energy. But if I were going to challenge you to design today a land use regulatory scheme that would be the most conserving of energy resources, it probably would follow this model and it would follow the model because if you have people living closer together, you are clearly not going to use as much fuel moving around between shopping and recreation and school and other activities. So if you increase the density restriction, you increase the amount of land area required before a new house might be developed between the village centers, then that would discourage development in those areas. And this wild-to-urban continuum was designed really with an aesthetic purpose, to try to protect the park-like character of the area. So the Adirondacks is roughly six million acres in size. It’s larger than Yosemite, Yellowstone, and Glacier National Parks put together. Wetlands in wild and scenic and recreational rivers were also designated. So that wetland designation gave the Adirondack Park Agency jurisdiction to deny development. The idea that a map might be a legal instrument is kind of an interesting thought. So that you can think about this as a kind of a set of concentric circles. And you can see that disk in Lake Tahoe at about fifty feet in depth, which is really pretty remarkable. In this case, when I worked in the Adirondacks, I happened to be responsible for the State of New York’s review of the project and remember very distinctly the initial proposal and my response requesting additional information that was about a fifty-page letter that I and colleagues wrote that we felt we needed in order to understand the environmental impacts of this development on the lake. If you were looking at this site from the middle of Lake Placid looking back at the mountain peaks and looking at the public lands that lie back here, it’s a very natural looking landscape, and that was something that was protected by the statute. ”So that what’s really driving the concern about this is underlying instincts, underlying ideologies about appropriate uses of land and appropriate definitions of private property rights, a libertarian instinct as opposed to an authoritarian instinct. And the private club decided that they were going to self-restrict their development rights, but that they were going to sell those development rights to the State of New York. So that they were able to do this in a way that reduced their tax burden. There are a variety of different instances where the nature conservancy throughout the United States has affected this strategy. And they were often at odds about what the right way to manage public lands ought to be."
442,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-18,"The lecture centers on public lands management and the effect of property rights on sustainable resource management. Property rights create a complex set of relationships that complicate effective environmental management. Popular conceptions of wilderness also make it difficult to manage public lands sustainably, since people view wilderness as a place of freedom, without regulation. Managing property rights and people’s concept of right to wilderness are the central issues facing natural resource managers and public lands managers. As a result, it is important to consider external forces, such as climate change, that influence one’s ability to exercise property rights.","I wanted to continue talking about property rights and the environment, and also to talk more about public lands and natural resource management problems. So one way to think about the history of the Adirondack Park is that prior to 1973, the local governments really had authority to control land use. After the passage of the law, the next day, all of a sudden, they did not have that authority anymore, and the rights of private landowners were radically reduced. I mean, do they have the ability or the money to hire ecologists or soil scientists or atmospheric scientists, water quality experts, to challenge the government’s claim that if they build the way they want to that damage is going to occur?Also, the idea of compensation, we’ll talk more about that, especially next week when we think about climate change in the coastal zone and what that means for all the property owners and the trillions of dollars in property value in the coastal zone. In a way, a right is a kind of a sphere of liberty. Now, when you think about the sources of legitimacy and law, if you go back into political and social theory, you’ll find really three dominant sources that are commonly mentioned. Now you’re telling us that we can’t do that. Well, this idea that tradition and custom really underlie the sense of legitimacy is really quite important. So that property rights are often created by regulation in ways that are not generally perceived. They’re going to sell the land along with the permit, so that they will basically accrue the increase in property value that’s associated with a new permit. So once you understand the property regime in an area, you have a much higher capacity to manage it. Using a standard that is more rigorous than the federal wilderness designation standard, which requires only 5,000 acres for a new wilderness area to be created, there are nearly twenty separate wilderness areas in the Adirondacks right now. It’s extremely rich in biological diversity. So that the Adirondacks, again with roughly a million and a quarter acres of designated wilderness offers many, many opportunities to seek solitude and get off on your own and test your physical and personal skills. So there are always questions about how much development and what kind can it sustain. Another kind of right that you might not think about is this right to use motor vehicles and the right of access. Because people had gone on to the public land as they have in many remote parts of the U.S. including in large areas of Alaska. And they have built these camps on public land. So that the amount of damage these can cause is really quite interesting. But still, they are significantly less efficient than our motor vehicle engines, such as cars. And helicopters would pick up the buckets and drop the lime over the lakes in an attempt to buffer the acidity and make it more suitable for the native strains of trout. So that in some way, they become a chronicle of past atmospheric quality. And these were highly contested because they are the tallest structures now between Albany, New York, and Montreal. So people first get frozen — they first get cold and then they become hypothermic."
443,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-19,"The lecture addresses the issue of takings and when the government has the right to seize private property for the public good. The government is required to compensate property owners in some circumstances. Through legal cases, Professor Wargo gives some examples of when compensation is required and why takings are an important management tool for environmental managers.","One is to take a look at this first slide and realize that this is lecture nineteen and it’s April 6, and you have two weeks after this week left of classes. And the jurisdictional boundaries are really complicated and I think very interesting. And the central problem represented by this map is that certain kinds of resources, such as wolves or grizzly bears or complexes of species, transcend these jurisdictional boundaries. And I mentioned the problem of fire crossing these jurisdictional boundaries as well, and having the Forest Service have a policy of fire suppression, as opposed to the Park Service’s policy of “let it burn.” And it’s kind of curious that the culture in Maine is extremely protective of property rights. And what’s unusual about this, and important, is that they basically took the idea that’s invented in the Adirondack Park Agency Act, the idea of zoning, restricting density, of trying to cluster development in areas that have existing services. So that California is unusual in its history of public ownership of much of the coastline, either as state parks or county parks, or in some instances, such as the Point Reyes National Seashore that was carved out from lands that I’ll speak about in just a moment. But if you put this idea of protecting resources in the coastal zone in the context of what we now know about climate change and the probability of sea level rise and the increased frequency of storms that are severe and increased severity of storms, then you should begin to think about the degree of liability that we face collectively as a nation, about the intensity of development that we have allowed in the coastal zone. So these coastal zone management strategies bear a lot of attention. And how property rights might be allocated in different ways. But it also is a really interesting example of this idea of buying up part of the bundle of rights. So the Park Service went into this area that was owned by farmers that had fairly large tracts of land, some hundreds or thousands of acres in size. So one way of getting and releasing the methane gas is to pump the water out of the area. So a lot of the farmers are experiencing a more dangerous situation to pursue their own livelihood. But you know that form of litigation often spans long periods of time. So in one case, this nuisance was defined by , a Supreme Court decision back in 1887, where the sale of alcoholic beverages was believed to be a public nuisance and prevented by regulation. Now, Grand Central Station at that time was managed by the Penn Central Transportation Company. And in this case, it was a bit unusual because the district that Grand Central Station is in, I mean, you walk out and you see the Yale Club. So they literally went in and appropriated the land, but they compensated the landowners, so that these seventy-two landowners did receive compensation. So this is really a fairly dramatic act on the part of any state government. Shouldn’t the government have the obligation to compensate you for that loss in right and that loss in value?Well, the Supreme Court has argued across a wide diversity of cases that if you are left with a property right that has some lingering remnant value, then a taking has not occurred. Connecticut River is just cresting now from a storm last week. So that the property owner went to court and claimed that his property rights and his value had been taken by the government and that he demanded compensation. So in effect, it was a question about psychological or visual access. And then imagine that the state wants — and you think of yourself as being a shorefront owner and that the public has no right of access across your area because the mean high watermark sits down a ways from where you are. Now, supposing that the state comes through and decides they want to nourish the beach. So that the state literally set a boundary between the private land and the public land."
444,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-1,"Professor John Wargo introduces the central question of the course, “Can law shape a sustainable future for ten billion people?” The purpose of the course is to examine the most important U.S. laws adopted over the past forty years, and to evaluate their effectiveness. Lectures will present histories of nuclear experimentation, industrial and organic agriculture, air quality, plastics, wilderness, green building certification, and land use regulation. By the end of the course students will be exposed to diverse statutory and regulatory strategies to prevent pollution, reduce wastes, protect human health, conserve energy, and to protect wild lands.","And the purpose is really to wonder with you about the potential effectiveness of environmental law. And also really answer the basic question, which is what’s worked, what has not, and why, as a way of thinking about how we’re going to respond to a very new world in which you will face, your children will face, your grandkids will face approximately ten to twelve billion people creating more demand on resources, more pollution, rising rates of consumption, rising rates of waste. And I’ve come to believe that the atmospheric weapons testing program of the 1940s and 1950s really demonstrates one of the greatest success stories that we have in environmental law, following the recognition that the radionuclides that were created and blown into the atmosphere, worked their way into the stratosphere, they encircled the globe. Right now, the synthetic chemical industry is dominated by the plastics industry; it constitutes seventy percent of the synthetic chemical industry in the United States. In one way, it means that we’re conducting quite a chemical experiment on ourselves, but also on future generations. So that these chemicals have no mechanism in law, even in the United States, to test what their effect is and what the risk might be to either environmental quality or to human health. They decide what monitoring programs are necessary in order to detect where they go, how they move, how they behave in the environment and how dangerous they are, who might be at risk. And these larger particulates, ten microns in size and larger, are visible. Many people think of the environment as not being that closely associated with human health. But again, it’s one of these types of threats to human health and environmental quality that was really very lightly treated, very lightly regulated during the twentieth century, and only now are we seeing the Food and Drug Administration being empowered to take tighter control over the way that products are marketed. There’s one that was shipped yesterday and should be in this afternoon. How is law related to science and uncertainty? We’ll also take a look at the idea of risk and precaution. So really, this set of paintings structured my thinking in a variety of different ways. Radioactive materials, the concentration of radioactive materials, particularly for the production of weapons, has created some of the most hazardous sites in the world. Transport, personal transport as opposed to public transit facilities, is a persistent and growing problem. We now have one vehicle in the United States for every person who is eligible to drive. We have more vehicles per capita in the United States than any other place in the world. And one aspect of this issue that I’m quite interested in is the Environmental Protection Agency spends probably ninety-five to ninety-eight percent of its time and budget thinking about the environment as being the outdoor environment. The warnings are illegible and unintelligible to a very large proportion of society. And I will show you how the statutes apply individually to the various cases. The majority of people that do that in society are highly specialized. And also thinking about how costs as well as benefits are allocated quite differently in society by environmental laws."
445,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-20,The lecture reviews the legal and economic strategies that can be used to manage coastal development. Over half of the United States population lives in coastal areas and will be affected by sea level rise and more intense storms. The lecture looks at the conflict between property rights and efforts to protect coastal ecosystems through the use of eminent domain to create national seashores. Barrier islands such as Fire Island National Seashore and Cape Cod National Seashore are used as case studies; a variety of strategies have been employed to manage these constantly moving islands. The lecture also discusses the role insurance plays in coastal settlement patterns; changes in insurers’ policies in high-risk coastal areas could change the way people settle in coastal regions.,"So I want to continue talking today about land use and the special problem that we face in managing land use and development in the coastal zone. So I thought I’d start out with a little cartoon. And of the twenty megacities in the world, fifteen of them are in coastal areas. Now, within the U.S., we have a statute called the Coastal Zone Management Act. Now, there was great debate within the Nixon Administration about the structure of this statute and what kind of teeth would be put into it. And I’ll give you a couple of examples over the next 45 minutes that will show you how the federal government has stepped in and applied eminent domain to purchase up open areas and resources that the government thought were particularly valuable, not just because of their ecological characteristics, but also because they provided recreational opportunities, particularly in the vicinity of these population centers. How about transferable development rights? I’ll speak about this in a few moments, but the idea behind transferable development rights is that you have a source zone. They might be property tax related, so that property taxes could be elevated in areas that are especially valuable. And many local governments have also filed suit. So think about the density of property and population that lives in the coastal zone. Because many of you perhaps have not been to Florida. And in a natural condition, in the bay, you would see wetlands and it would be a very active nursery for a variety of commercial marine species, as I mentioned earlier. And if you look also at the ecological characteristics of the coastline here, you can see the same kind of barrier spit, but in the natural form that existed down in Miami, at Miami Beach, before that was intensively developed. The dune then builds itself up under natural conditions. So anything that is deposited on the surface can easily migrate beneath the surface. And many don’t also understand that during periods of intense storms that these barrier islands want to basically be cut into segments so that they get over washed, and then as the bays behind them fill up, the tide goes down, the water shoots out of the bay and cuts across. And the U.S. federal government, through the flood insurance program, paid for the entire cost. So that a natural condition is a rare condition for a barrier and the estuary that it harbors in the United States now because of the intensity of development and the incentive that people have had to try to make money by investing in property in this area. By planting these sprigs of grass, they can cause a dune system to become restored within a matter of a couple of years. So it was a carrot and a stick idea in a way. The Fire Island Lighthouse was built right on the end of this spit. Very interesting outcome that has attracted a lot of litigation."
446,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-21,"The lecture critiques the U.S. Green Building Council’s (USGBC) certification system, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design). The criteria for being highly rated under LEED emphasize energy efficiency and minimizing waste, but do not prioritize environmental health and limiting use of dangerous plastics and chemicals. USGBC is a non-profit organization, not a government agency, and has employees of for-profit organizations on its board of directors. The lecture discusses the implications of having a non-profit organization run this system and be responsible for evaluating environmental quality in architecture and construction.","Today I want to talk about green building and the opportunity to also think about the laws that surround green building, and also the energy implications of green building standards. Because it basically implies that certain standards are being applied to something. I mean, obviously, we’re changing our behavior. So that the every house would likely have a lawn, the lawn would require sprinkling. Now, on Thursday, I’m going to come back and talk more about the new town movement in the United States and this problem of managing growth at a larger scale than today’s lecture, which is really focused on the individual buildings. Irvine, California is the example in this slide. So that this low-density development demands even more time spent in cars and more fuel. So here’s an example of a shower stall that has multiple showerheads in it, multiple faucets. But you can imagine, every time you plug in one and then go out to the meter and take a reading, come back in, unplug it and plug in something else, it’s going to take you a very long time to figure out where you’re spending your money. So this idea that one would think about building materials and the style of design in a way that would consider the ultimate product lifecycle, this is really a pretty new idea in the building industry. The Kroon Building was just certified to be a platinum building, as an example. So these are the different kinds of certification programs that LEED has beneath its umbrella. But also, schools, core and shell components of buildings, neighborhood development, retail facilities, healthcare facilities, commercial interiors, and homes. There was a green roof that’s on part of that site. And I wanted to mention a couple of kind of relatively recent technological designs. So my plumber gave me a lesson in environmental behavior that I thought was quite valuable. So in general, outdoor air quality is better than indoor air quality, unless you live in proximity to an industrial area or to a highway. Rugs may be made out of natural products, natural fibers, such as wool or cotton or now increasingly some reed material from South America. Should Nestle be allowed to gain certification for marketing products that are not likely to be recycled?Here’s another example of a project that was certified in Florida. And you remember the lecture last week about barrier islands. Clearly this program gives a higher priority to energy efficiency over indoor environmental quality or human health. So there is no requirement under LEED to filter water, despite the fact that many water lines are capable of transmitting not just metals but also some of the components of plastics. So that it’s creating a pattern of exposure that really we don’t understand well. And this program has no accountability at all to the United States public, at the same time that it’s being built into law at all levels of government. We’ll come back to larger questions of community design on Thursday."
447,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-22,"The lecture begins a discussion of present and future energy demands and the ways in which we invest in different forms of energy by focusing on nuclear energy use globally. The risks associated with nuclear energy are described, including risk of human error leading to a mass evacuation event, and the challenges faced in finding an adequate nuclear waste storage facility for the United States. Such a facility would be need to be able to store nuclear waste for a million years or more, due to the long half-lives of nuclear waste. The lecture describes the disaster that took place at Chernobyl nuclear plant, and the wide-ranging effects of that disaster on the natural and built environments as well as human health.","The other day after class, I went over and talked to the construction manager for the project outside, who would assured me that they would not be using any loud equipment this morning. And California is quite striking in that in 1976 the State of California enacted a moratorium against new nuclear power plant development. But you also might think about relative risk and ease of bringing additional capacity online given the different sources. And underlying this, I think, is an underestimated cultural factor, which is what we worry about in the United States, and our predisposition to remember not just Chernobyl, but also what happened at Three Mile Island in 1979. The capital costs of constructing a new plant are often enormous. So states might have the authority to do that. So that the capacity to move people away from a contaminated zone, to be able to predict how that zone might vary given weather patterns, it really is quite limited. So when engineers and safety experts were thinking about the problem posed by Yucca Mountain, this is the mountain in Nevada where the storage facility has been partially constructed, using about nine billion dollars of taxpayers’ money. What if some massive accident occurred, nuclear war or whatever it is, that leads whatever society exists that stumbles across this plant to recognize it? And the symbolism that is chosen is not represented here. ”Now, another problem with nuclear power is the potential for proliferation of nuclear weapons. So the case history that is most important I think for us to think about, which caused the greatest amount of environmental damage in history with respect to a nuclear power plant occurred at the Chernobyl plant in Pripyat, then within the Soviet Union. Well, they realized that the different nations all had separate radiation standards. So that this map was constantly changing in response to more rigorous testing. So that the darkest red are the confiscated areas. The construction workers that were trying to put out the fire and then deal with the contaminated areas would drive vehicles in whether they were aircraft, whether or not they were cars or trucks such as this. Civil defense officials were finally able to convince the government and plant officials of the need to evacuate areas that were closest to the plant. Eventually, 210,000 people were resettled into less contaminated areas. So that finally, the Europeans decided to ban meat, live animals, and produce from all areas within 1,000 kilometers of the site. So the economic consequences just associated with the food supply and its contamination were far higher than anybody imagined. On a world scale, the number is far more significant."
448,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-23,"The lecture discusses the various factors affecting the expansion of the U.S. renewable energy portfolio, as well as the importance of energy efficiency and changes to current consumption. As a case study, Professor Wargo discusses the nine-year effort to create Cape Wind, a wind farm off the coast of Massachusetts. The project has faced opposition for a number of reasons, including noise and disruption of use of private property. The lecture ties the development of more renewable energy options to issues of property rights and discusses ways to overcome challenges in siting, in noise pollution, and in the impacts on wildlife (i.e. avian mortality as a result of wind farms).","We have a lot of visitors today from Yale Bulldog Days and you are all very, very welcome. So that these expenses may be eligible for tax credits as well. So that these production tax credits that came into being in 2005 really have been quite successful, as is demonstrated. There is a business solar tax credit that offers a thirty percent tax credit for the purchase of equipment that produces solar electricity. Also, many states are acting on their own. So states have jumped into this problem by creating their own renewable energy portfolio standards. It’s quite obviously more expensive to develop further offshore. If we rely more heavily on wind, we need to think about how to get transmission facilities, transmission lines, in close proximity to the key sources of wind. So that the deceptive aspect of that statistic is that the conflict that surrounds this is not generated by the site development and the amount of area, the land area or the ocean area that has to be disturbed in order to put the facilities in, it’s generated by its visibility, predominantly by people’s impressions that I find to be really quite curious. And this is very much a prominent part of the argument on the part of landowners in the coastal area that looks out over Nantucket Sound. So unlike underground minerals, no one can extract wind or solar radiation from your property without your consent. So that you would have the opportunity to prevent somebody from coming onto your land and building a wind turbine. So if you take a look at this wind map of the southern New England coastline, you see that there are areas, particularly off of Rhode Island and particularly here in Nantucket Sound, which are really quite suitable in terms of the amount of wind energy that is available for development. So I don’t know if this is going to work. Now, right now the Cape Wind Company is awaiting a decision on the part of Ken Salazar, who is the Secretary of the Interior. I want you to think about the relative historical absence of federal subsidy of renewable energy sources and compare that to the subsidies that have occurred for the oil industry. Now think also about the national cost to maintain and build or rebuild our national highway system. So now I think about the highway system as being really an enormous subsidy for the oil industry as well as for the auto industries. We have a clear problem that we need to deal with there. They zoned other areas for agricultural growth, food farms, that why not the concept of zoning for wind farms?Now, you could argue that well, if you’re going to zone for wind farms, you need to think about how you’re going to manage the externalities that might fall onto adjacent landowners. And zoning in corridors has always been a part of local and state land use regulations. I mentioned the coal bed methane issue and think distinctively about how that coal bed methane property right was allowed to be purchased by the private sector, whereas the wind property right, like the solar property right, is generally assigned with the surface lands. And as you think about every case that we’ve discussed in this term, when we think about environmental effects, you should be thinking about the magnitude of the effect and you should be thinking about the distribution of the effect. So the consideration of magnitude and distribution as well, by thinking about questions of equity, who are these damages going to fall onto?"
449,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-24,"The final lecture reviews topics discussed in previous lectures by imagining an ideal society. Professor Wargo talks about success stories in land management in the Adirondacks and pesticide regulation, and notes ongoing challenges in food safety, drinking water quality, personal consumption, population control, and the creation of parks and protected areas. He lectures about the fractured nature of environmental management at different levels of government, and the way governmental and corporate secrecy have affected environmental regulation. He ends the lecture with advice for students.","A couple updates that I thought you might be interested in: U.S. District Court in San Juan just dismissed the case of 7,000 Viequense who had filed a suit against the federal government, the Department of the Navy, seeking compensation for damages to their island and their health. So this should give you pause to think about the effect and cost of litigation. And what was interesting about it is that it was a period of collision between different social movements that really had a core based in universities. So I wanted to reflect with you today about imagining an ideal society. And one of the themes of this course has been to try to help you judge the effectiveness and potential of environmental law to shape behavior so that people will behave more responsibly toward the environment and protect human health and protect scarce natural resources. And those don’t normally go hand in hand. And I think clearly, the wilderness protection system and the national park system that we have in the United States really is the envy of many nations in the world. The Adirondack Park strikes me as also being a real success story in many ways. So that that would constitute roughly about a hundred acres. But maybe they didn’t want to — they may not want to develop on their own property. The nuclear weapons testing ban back in 1963.Population control. You may think of food safety as kind of an odd topic, but in low-income parts of the world, food safety is a major source of illness. It’s fractured by media, by air, water, food, consumer products. It’s fractured by level of government, so we have law that is established by local governments, state governments and the federal government that is often incompatible, and it’s extremely confusing for those that want to develop, such as the wind turbine farm, Cape Wind up in Massachusetts. We have little surveillance at the scale that’s relevant to the individual, and something that we have not spoken about that’s really important is that environmental monitoring responsibilities and surveillance responsibilities have largely been delegated to those that are regulated over the past several decades by the Environmental Protection Agency. There’s no one else that is independent that monitors it. The pace of regulation is often slower than litigation. There are action channels and there are groups of people that are well known to the regulators that play a disproportionate role in making choices that have a much more highly distributed effect. So being able to identify the sustained yield and to develop an understanding of how you go into an area and you get the timber out without depleting the soil resources say of organic matter, water holding capacity, that’s a technical issue. So that there are different forms of standards, different decision making criteria and analyses across these laws. Well, European law evolved based upon a collection of principles, principles that are not embedded in all of our laws. So we have no law in our country that basically forces the statute to comply with principles such as exist in the EU law. The poorest are left to the most marginal lands. So one idea, thinking about whether or not there is a trickle-down effect. And will this be a stairway to improved environmental quality and human health?I wanted to just mention too, and emphasize this idea once more of narrative advantage and how critical it is, given the scale of money that’s being put into advertising. Secrecy is another, deception is another, privacy is another, language barriers."
450,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-2,"The United States’ fragmented, piecemeal approach to environmental law is presented through the cases that led to the creation of major environmental statutes such as the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The variety of federal agencies and levels of government that participate in creating and implementing regulation contribute to the fragmentation of American environmental law. Environmental law seeks to balance the costs of environmental degradation with the economic benefits that companies reap. However, the uncertainty of environmental costs leads to a slow and ineffective regulation process.",": For those of you that were not here on Tuesday, I just want to review a few introductory comments. But also to get you to think more broadly and deeply about our capacity to use law to shape human behavior. But they’ll be designed in a way and presented in a way to encourage you to think about evaluating law, to think about what’s worked, what has not, and why as a way of thinking about how you might design law for the future. And what I’m hoping you’ll do is come to the lecture, because you’ll see often just images and you won’t know how to interpret those images. And also, the discussion sections are critical to the course, so that it’s important that you go to your discussion sections. So Congress passes a statute, sets out broad guidelines, and then the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to set regulations that really are more refined and dependent upon scientific evidence. What are the costs and benefits associated with regulation? And there are highly individualized cases. And unfortunately the process of adjudication in the court system is not very close to the process of discovering new knowledge that we think about here within the academy. So another key question is monitoring and surveillance. The chemical is released into the marketplace. It gets used to be sprayed on carpets to keep red wine from absorbing to the fiber. Preemption is a really interesting idea that the federal government could prevent a state from adopting regulations that might be different or less restrictive than the federal standards. So that thinking about what kinds of problems are amenable to having states have more authority as opposed to when do we want to centralize authority across all states and locate the authority with the federal government? And this was just a very small group of lawyers that were trying to pick apart my claim that a chemical posed a specific threat to children. There are a variety of international standards set up to prevent the export of hazardous waste. Also, our system of law is very poorly supported by the nonprofit community. Because people are thinking now out over a long time horizon in ways that they never had before. Now I’m telling you that this is costing society an enormous amount of money. They figured out that these radionuclides wouldn’t just kind of go away. But the Atomic Energy Commission created this clandestine operation where they collected dead bodies from 15,000 people around the world and they sent them to labs in Chicago and to Lamont Laboratory and to Columbia University, where they were tested. And every bone they tested found strontium-90 in it. So these people were sitting around in the Atomic Energy Commission’s headquarters actually saying, “Well, what is the law on body snatching?” So the Atomic Energy Commission was collecting bones from around the world, and they were able to build this map of the deposition rate of strontium-90 by looking at bones that came from Argentina, bones that came from South Africa. People generally don’t like to give bone samples so that their bones can be tested for strontium-90. You’ve probably heard about mercury in shark and large predatory fish. See how much fun we’re going to have?I’m going to leave you today with one image. And standing there looking out at these magnificent mountains, I suddenly realized, given what I’ve told you today, chemical movement through the atmosphere through the environment, I suddenly realized that the idea of wildness, the idea of purity, the idea of environmental quality that most people have and most people value, is really being challenged by the way we’re using and abusing chemicals."
451,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-3,"To illustrate the linkages among national security, secrecy, and environmental quality, Professor Wargo describes the Atomic Energy Commission’s nuclear tests in the 1950s. The Atomic Energy Commission collected data on the spread of radionuclides from the nuclear tests, and discovered that the radionuclides were circulating around the world. This process of discovery raised issues regarding ways to manage risks to the population while both continuing the nuclear tests and keeping them secret for national security reasons.","This lecture is about national security, and it’s about the conflict that’s involved during the twentieth century between national security and environmental quality and human health. So national security and environmental quality. I’m not meaning to imply that other people are not intelligent, I’m meaning to hopefully get you to think about the idea of a legal system that would produce a public that was literate and capable of understanding the quality of the environment around them, what’s threatening and what’s not, so that potentially they could manage their exposure to chemicals, they could manage the effect of human behavior on a variety of environmental issues, such as endangered species. So think about it as a problem of understanding production and flow of knowledge. And he had access to top-secret material. And what’s interesting is the way that they thought about environmental science. Where do they go when a bomb explodes, what happens? And the power of the bomb determines how high up into the atmosphere the particles get. It must be out of tune, it must be detecting something that is not there.” And at that point in time, they used to put the Polaroid film, the eight-and-a-half by eleven sheets, into boxes. But instead, they used to pack it with cornhusks. This is a very important lesson in environmental science and environmental policy. And you see in this case that at 30,000 feet, one swirled around Texas for about a week. I couldn’t be here, which is kind of an interesting thought, I couldn’t be here right now telling you this story had the declassification process not occurred under the Clinton Administration. So here is a map of the United States constructed by the National Cancer Institute in the late 1990s, that took the dose estimates that they got from the soils, because they could back calculate the concentrations from existing concentrations, knowing the decay rate of different nuclides. You have two beers within fifteen minutes. Well, from time of conception roughly until the time of thirteen. And the U.S. began to study fallout data. And the Siberian radionuclides tended to come down across Alaska and across Canada and into the Western and Midwestern part of the U.S., so in threads that are similar to the ones that I showed you from the Nevada test site. So these were legitimate national security concerns that they were exploring. So just like you find variability in air pollution today from motor vehicles, depending upon climate and where vehicle use is most intense, you find in this case states being worried about specific patterns of concentration in the crops that they grow. So it’s kind of curious that milk became the standard for trying to figure out where the chemicals went, especially powdered buttermilk, because in its dehydrated form, it was easy to send around the country. So environmentalists and public health advocates were arguing, no, you don’t understand this pattern of deposition. Is the problem human induced or is it more important to worry about natural sources?Natural sources of radiation, hmm. And you probably know that you get a measurable dose of radiation when you’re up in aircraft. So that common property around the world is now protected by international treaty."
452,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-4,"The United States government employed a variety of approaches to protect citizens from danger, including public education, nuclear weapons testing, and gathering data about the effects of nuclear testing. The U.S. government’s testing of nuclear weapons at the Bikini Atoll is used as an example of government approaches. Nuclear testing led to ecological devastation, leading the U.S. government to move Bikinians to another island. The case highlights the far-reaching environmental, economic, and health consequences of nuclear weapons testing.","We’re going to talk today about managing technological dangers. One typical approach that was used in this history was the reliance on expertise. Public education is another approach, and we’ll see in a film clip in a few moments, if our audio and video work correctly, we’ll see the Atomic Energy Commission’s public service announcements, designed to maintain and build public support. Minimize environmental release and exposure. And several hundred Bikinians were asked by the federal government back in 1945 if they would move from the island, if they would give up their homeland in order to provide a location or a territory for the explosions, recognizing that the Marshall Islands are thousands of square miles of open ocean with a very, very small population. There are very few places on earth where you could find such an area where the population density was so low. Basically, they were just sand and beneath the sand was volcanic material. So think about this as representing different intensities of radiation that one would experience had they been in proximity to the site of the explosion. And gradually, they overcame those technical difficulties and Tsar Bomba was the largest bomb ever exploded up in northern Russia in the twentieth century. This understanding of the enormous destructive force of a single weapon really transformed the impression of the experts about the implications of what they were doing. Roughly 70,000, that ranged from the bombs of this scale to those that would be deliverable via a suitcase or from an artillery shell. And what would the long-term threat be?So here’s an example. <> Common sense tells you this is dangerous and foolish. What would this mean to hundreds of millions of people in the United States at the time, or to the government’s responsibility to educate them so that they would know what to do?Well, Tsar Bomba and the Bravo test basically told them that the cities were enormously vulnerable. So that the public is quite actually resistant to rings of the alarm. And it was attributed to the foods that were grown on the island. So they were allowed to stay there for a year. There were conflicting interpretations of the evidence that was available. And that explained why the drought was correlated with an increase in the body concentration of some of the compounds. By 1999, the Government Accounting Office, is what it used to be called."
453,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-5,"During this session, Professor Wargo stresses the importance of considering the persistence of pollutants in the environment. He continues the discussion of the Atomic Energy Commission’s (AEC) risk management strategies in the wake of nuclear experiments from 1945-1963, and also introduces risk reduction strategies attempted after the nuclear explosion at Chernobyl. These strategies underestimated the persistence of radionuclides in the environment. All of these approaches took place in secret, and these proceedings were only declassified in the 1990s. Governmental secrecy in these cases prevents the public from becoming fully literate about environmental risks and from being able to challenge or test the government’s narrative.","A student, a former student of mine, emailed me last night from Lake Tahoe, where they had received six feet of snow in the past four days. And I also want to start out by having you consider the central challenges that were faced by the president, the Defense Department, and the Atomic Energy Commission. Also, the x-ray film, as I described, being overexposed when it arrived at hospitals led people to understand that something was going on. And if you step back and you think about the location of the testing site in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, they were very conscious of what really has become a fundamental principal of managing the environment and producing environmental quality, which is the idea that dilution is the solution to pollution. They started bombing them with ground up coconut shells. Oppenheimer and his close colleagues and friends were branded as Communists and communist sympathizers. They don’t really know what to do with it. So you can see Hunter’s Point in this map from Google Earth over here. It might be thyroid disease, it could be thyroid cancer, it could be leukemia, it could be bone cancer, it could be different types of blood disorders. So he goes to the community, he interviews people using a fairly extensive survey form. So the wealthier in most societies have access to medical care that allows for early diagnosis, early treatment, so that the ultimate damage is often less among the wealthy. The down winders, those that simply lived in the area, have now received about $600,000, or excuse me, $600,000,000, about 12,000 different claims have been approved. And also the long residency time of the radionuclides in the atmosphere. And you may recall from earlier history courses that the Nuremberg Trial in 1946 produced eventually consensus about ethical guidelines for human experimentation. So that there was no sense of what the humanitarian benefit might be. So that now when we think about the design and license of a new drug, we construct the calculus of good versus harm at the level of the individual as opposed to at the level of society. Twenty-one of these were supported by federal funds determined to be non-therapeutic. And both mothers had been diagnosed with thyroid cancer. The presumption that if they heard nothing back from the parent, who might be traveling or whatever, that they would go ahead with the experiment. And it is important to know that they have power to classify at all levels. It’s about having the idea that it’s okay to release this material to the environment and that it’s not going to come back to haunt us in the form of water pollution or air pollution. But there are experimental guidelines that you could now imagine that you would want in place before the government would have authority to conduct those types of tests. Also later in the term, when we think about the current status and the future of nuclear power, we’re not going to move into this discussion too deeply today, but I want you to think about the similarity between what we learned by 1963, and then what we learned from the Chernobyl event. So they dug deep trenches and they buried the military equipment, they dug trenches, they drove the fire trucks into them and buried the fire trucks, they buried cars."
454,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-6,"The military’s use of the Puerto Rican island of Vieques as a training site is discussed to highlight the challenges involved in identifying and restoring hazardous sites. Political opposition is faced while attempting to get a site recognized as hazardous, deciding how to compensate those affected, and determining an appropriate level of environmental restoration. The recurring theme of government secrecy and its effect on efforts to protect the environment is also covered during this lecture, as the US military is reluctant to allow researchers to examine testing grounds. The reclamation of these sites involves many environmental statutes, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).",": Today we’re going to turn our attention to the problem of recognizing and restoring hazardous sites. What standard of risk should be applied?One statute that we’ll look at will include the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, really a vanguard statute that was adopted really at the pinnacle of public concern about loss of environmental quality, riding the beginning of the wave of the environmental movement, or the second wave really of the environmental movement in the nation. The Clean Water Act, also known as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, is often at play in the identification of these sites and their cleanup because the chemicals that were released run off into surface waters. So in many cases, you find these old factories that have simply moved on. So first of all, the sites have to be identified. And by the way, this is very similar to the Safe Drinking Water Act in that a chemical will not get any attention, it won’t be monitored by anybody unless it gets on the Safe Drinking Water list of contaminates, and there are only ninety-three chemicals on that list. And among those, since the statute was enacted, only 773 have been restored. So for any of these sites, in this case we’ll be looking at the Defense Department and particularly the Navy as the responsible party, there are serious problems of historical reconstruction that are compounded particularly by the authority of the Defense Department to maintain classified information. The GIs that would storm the beaches under live fire? So there was a psychological effect there. So that’s all with just an introduction to one case. They decided on the eastern coast of Puerto Rico, which you can see here is the Roosevelt Roads at the head of the arrow, which was the core of the base, Vieques and Culebra Island. And you can imagine that this island was owned predominately by several sugar plantations so that 23,000 acres of land was purchased by the Defense Department. What would happen if you lobbed artillery shells onto it? And this shot is a little bit higher in resolution. Destroyers would sit offshore and they would lob these artillery shells onto the island. So they left the munitions buried beneath the beach. And this one happened to be dragged by barge all the way across the Pacific to the Panama Canal, through the Panama Canal up into the Caribbean Basin and then anchored off of the shore of Vieques for target practice. So sitting about three-quarters of a mile off of the shoreline. But it’s a bit worrisome knowing that the sand that is now in it came from the Marshall Islands area. And the Navy tried to explain these circles beneath the surface of the water as being created by hurricanes, rather than being created by bombs that had been dropped creating these craters in the ocean floor. And he would take samples from inside the craters and then from various distances outside the crater. The Navy also claimed that higher levels of lead in the soil or other metals were the cause of dust storms that blew over from Africa so that the island does experience dust storms during certain parts of the year. ”If you dive beneath the surface, you can see weapons such as this 2,000-pound bomb being measured by Dr. Porter."
455,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-7,"This lecture covers site restoration law by looking at the U.S. Navy’s use of the island of Vieques as weapons testing ground. Vieques residents are filing a civil suit against the U.S. government, which raises issues of burden of proof, scientific certainty with respect to exposure amounts and health impacts, and how the government protects citizens from environmental hazards. Professor Wargo traces the evolution of site restoration law, from the National Environmental Policy Act in 1969 setting the stage for sustainable land use, to Superfund amendments in the late 1980s that mandated more stringent protection of citizens from toxics.","Okay, so I want to continue the story about cleaning up landscapes that have been severely affected. To create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans. Now in this case, in the case that we talked about on Tuesday, hazardous site on Vieques in Puerto Rico, this was a very important statute in that the court case, , or , was brought in part because the Navy had not developed an environmental impact statement that projected out what the long-term effects might be of their continued bombing of the island. So I looked for it and in Mudd Library, the former government documents library here, we had and we still have many environmental impact statements that you can request. And one interesting thing is that you see that this side of the bay over here looks like it was continually targeted. So you can imagine that adding additional chemicals is something that the chemical companies and people that use basic chemicals don’t really want to have happen because it increases their accounting responsibilities and their reporting responsibilities to the government. And that grease and the solvent would then just be thrown into the dump. And it requires an inventory and monitoring of underground storage tanks. So this design error has polluted ground water and soil literally around the world. And RCRA also, as I mentioned earlier, contains a citizen suit provision. And this basically gave every community the right to know about chemicals that are made by, stored in, or emitted from local businesses. But unless, and we’ll talk about this in a week or so, unless Connecticut is out of compliance with the Clean Air Act standards, then we have to meet California standards, which are the toughest in the nation. So it allows the citizens of the nation to basically get expert scientific advice to figure out what chemicals are released and how people might be exposed and what the hazards are. So they virtually washed their hands of this being a significant threat to human health. In one respect, they responded that well, they are protected by sovereign immunity, which basically is an argument that the king is immune from any litigation, that the king should not be held accountable for past behavior. So that several law firms have picked this up. If you were on the range, you could feel it in your chest. These images, recorded five years ago by University of Georgia scientists, show the former bombing range and surrounding waters strewn with unexploded ordinance. But he faces a serious burden of proof of exposure to chemicals that were released by the Navy. It’s incredibly complex scientifically and would be very expensive to document how long do these chemicals last in somebody’s body? Whereas plausibly, it could take up to a billion dollars to clean this area and also to provide sufficient medical care for the community. They weren’t thinking about airborne dust and prevailing winds. So it is distinctive in the United States right now because it is the only Superfund site, reserved for the most hazardous sites in the nation, that is also declared to be a wilderness area, a paradox that maybe you could explain to me, especially looking at the site. I took a research crew out there several years ago."
456,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-8,"The change from smaller, more diverse farms to larger single-crop farms in the U.S. has led to greater reliance on pesticides for pest management. Other changes as the U.S. food system becomes more commercialized include: increased use of additives, higher food prices, more water and energy consumption for agriculture, and more pesticide residues entering food through processing. Pesticides have also been used to combat insect-borne diseases, like malaria. The lecture provides an overview of relevant food, agriculture, and pesticide law, and covers the changes in pesticide use as scientific knowledge of a given chemical (i.e. DDT) improves.","This is one of my favorite topics in the course, food, agriculture. So to begin, I want you to think about the percentage of the world that is used to grow crops or to graze livestock. So here are four crops represented in these pictures. And the answer is often yes, the residues do persist, they do get into the food supply. They do not have to be labeled under federal food law. And I’ll talk more about that in a few moments. Worker safety is another deeper problem that we don’t pay much attention to. What about their requirements to disclose risks that are known to be associated with their foods?So it’s interesting that the organic food industry evolved, basically growing from a strategy that proclaims that a certain class of chemicals is not present in the food supply. And you can figure out which farmers are getting which subsidies. So that government funds could be used to innovate, to really transform the structure of agriculture in the nation. So that the value of the land in terms of its productivity for different crops often can’t compete with this rising property value, so the farmer sells out. Now, there also was an overabundance of enthusiasm among the farmers to produce the ethanol. The Hazardous Material Transportation Act does as well. So you release a chemical to the environment, the atomic weapons testing history tells us you’d better understand something about where it goes. Malaria is an illness that’s transmitted by a parasite. Although in epidemics, all age groups are affected. Those that already have their immune system compromised. Well, one of the ways of controlling malaria, including pesticides, and here’s an example of a worker in 1939 in an outbreak in Natal, Brazil, when a mosquito actually hitchhiked from Africa on a mail boat, an mosquito, not indigenous to Brazil. So that the heavy metals used earlier in the century were replaced by the chlorinated hydrocarbons. So by 1950, DDT was being marketed as an effective way to control pests that would threaten just about every crop you could imagine. There was no understanding of its bioaccumulation capacity. But here’s another example of Jones Beach in New York, where the County Public Health Department is driving down the beach and the sign that is on the side of this truck, you can’t read it I’m sure, but it’s telling, it says, “DDT, powerful insecticide, harmless to humans.” Well, it’s because of the increase number of pests that you get closer to the Equator in tropical parts of the world, led those nations to spray more DDT, both for sanitation and public health purposes, but also for crop protection purposes. And it probably is still detectable in your tissue. Whereas the Soviets found that it was worthy of a ban. And it convened this group to try to figure out whether or not it made sense to get behind DDT and to use it again. And we’ll come back on Thursday and take a closer look at the variety of laws that apply to food safety in the nation."
457,environmental-studies,evst-255,lecture-9,"The lecture charts the evolution of pesticide regulation in the United States. The evolution of the management and regulation of pesticides reflects changes in scientific understanding of pesticides as well as changes in human values. As technology allowed for testing of pesticides at smaller and smaller concentrations, restrictions on pesticide use grew. The government’s growing understanding of cumulative risk also has led to changes in pesticide testing and regulation.",": Today I want to talk about the relationship between risk and law. Their estimate is that between 30 and 45 or 50 million people carried the virus and had some adverse effect from it. There are few illnesses that have that rate. So that the lecture today really will trace the evolution of law and demonstrate how it’s shifted from 1906 to the present. The Pure Food and Drug Act was passed in 1906 as well, and it forbade foreign and interstate commerce and adulterated or fraudulently labeled food and drugs. And many chemicals are present in food at the part per trillion level. It’s got people thinking about well, what does that mean? Actually, it would be a good assignment for teaching fellows to disseminate. Many of the buildings at Yale are sprayed by pesticides indoors. So that type of use often had to have a separate registration. So that plastics have carried biocides into our environment in a whole set of ways. And they really also do not have and have not had much expertise in environmental science to know what happened to the chemicals once they were released or to think carefully about the health effects. So the medical expertise within the Department of Agriculture throughout their period of jurisdiction, which ended in 1970, when the Environmental Protection Agency was formed, was a period when they really had very little expertise in environmental science or in medical science, which is really fundamental to the way that we’re thinking about regulating pesticides today. So you can imagine entire sub-bureaucracies picking up and moving their materials to EPA. All of these were the chlorinated hydrocarbons. Well, this was recognized by the National Academy of Sciences, in two publications that I had a chance to work on, one regulating pesticides and food that really critiqued the Delaney paradox. FDA had interpreted zero risk to mean a little bit of risk. And they define that generally as a one-in-a-million risk threshold. So working with a bunch of specialists in cancer, as well as specialists in residue chemistry and exposure analysis, we came up with a not too complimentary picture of the way that EPA had regulated carcinogens in the food and recommended also that they pay much more attention to the individual diet, that the diet was likely to be the key route of exposure to a variety of different chemicals. And the diversity in patterns of exposure in environmental law is something that I became curious about and wondered about whether or not you’d find the same thing relative to drinking water. So how do you take a body of law such as the body that I just described to you for these chemicals, and transform it to be more sensitive to the reality of these patterns of chemical use and exposure?So what I’m painting here is a picture of what I think of as fractured science and fractured law, so that the legal authority for pesticides is now broken into three different bureaus, the Environmental Protection Agency, that is responsible for tolerance setting, but also toxicity testing. And the Department of Agriculture is responsible for the enforcement of these statutes in meat and poultry, and also for the assessment of economic benefits associated with producing the nation’s food supply. So that in Great Britain, they’ve created a new food safety organization that is really quite distinctive as a model. The primary authority for tolerance setting was taken away from the Department of Agriculture, just like the authority for regulating nuclear power was taken away from the Atomic Energy Commission, so the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was created. It did away with the risk-benefit balancing standard and it said, “Okay, instead, EPA must make its choices based upon the phrase ‘reasonable certainty of no harm. How would you define the most risky chemicals?"
458,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-10,"Air is able to hold a limited amount of water vapor, and that amount depends on the temperature of the air. When this saturation vapor pressure is exceeded, liquid water begins to condense and clouds form. There are several different types of clouds, some which rain and others which do not, and each with characteristics specific to it. Vortices are a particular type of cloud phenomenon in which there is a low pressure anomaly in the center of the cloud with rotating air around it, forming funnel clouds as seen in tornados. The low pressure allows liquid water to condense and form the funnel shaped cloud. Haze is another specific type of cloud in which liquid water condenses onto pollution particles in the air.","Well we’re going to spend the day today talking about clouds. So it’s all about water in the atmosphere today. I didn’t show this last, time but I should have. And if you wait long enough, the partial pressure of water vapor in that chamber will come to the value given by this curve, depending on the temperature of the system. Or another way to put it is that the saturation vapor pressure is the maximum you can have before condensation begins. And when I get there, whether it’s there or there, doesn’t matter, the relative humidity will be 100%. It can’t be held, and the excess goes into liquid droplets. And the way you do that is usually to have a clear night, no clouds above, so the infrared radiation from the earth’s surface can escape very handily. So you can get radiation fog in flat terrain. Instead of doing it by radiation, you did it by moving warm moist air over a colder surface. In fact, you might have advection fog 2/3 of the time. But in all cases, the thermodynamics is the same. This is heat from the land rising, but then as the air rises, it cools. We have instruments on-board the aircraft that can measure this. And that has a lot to do with then whether it’s going to rain or not. A raindrop is about 100 times larger than a cloud droplet. Remember, I said the diameters had a ratio of 100 to 1. And we found some variability from case to case in that cloud droplet size. I’m not going to go through this exhaustively. And when it’s lifted it’ll reach the saturation point, perhaps cloud will form. So the air is rising here, forming that cloud–we don’t see the other side of it here–the remarkable thing is that cloud stays more or less steady as the air continues to flow through it. These occur in a variety of different configurations. We’ll talk more about tornadoes later in the course. Pretend you didn’t look at that for a moment. Well, you know as a—in order for an aircraft to fly it has to have fast air moving over the top of the wing, which by Bernoulli’s law gives you low pressure, and higher pressure at the bottom, near the end of that wing. And this is moving along with it, exactly following it. Notice there’s another one, little one, just behind the cockpit. When you do that, when you expand air without adding heat, you cool it by the work that it does on its environment. And they are just fair weather cumulus clouds caused by the heating of the ground by the sun. We’re almost done, but I want to remind you that we’re talking about clouds."
459,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-11,Scattered visible light and microwave radar can used used to detect clouds and precipitation. Cloud formation in rising air can be simulated in the classroom by suddenly dropping the pressure in a glass chamber. The small cloud droplets formed in this way fall too slowly to ever reach the earth. There are two main mechanisms by which precipitation is generated from clouds. Collision coalescence occurs mainly over tropical oceans whereas the ice phase mechanism is more common and also more relevant to the practice of cloud seeding.,"Well, when I lectured last on Wednesday of last week, we went through a long PowerPoint presentation about water in the atmosphere. In other words, the shorter the wavelength, the more is the scattering under that condition. Usually that wavelength is about 10 centimeters, about like that. So with this longer wavelength, you’re almost always going to be in the Rayleigh scattering regime because your wavelength here is so much larger than the wavelength of visible light. You do not see the cloud you see with the visible eye. But the radar will bounce off from the raindrops or the snowflakes within that cloud. Of course, clouds produced precipitation, but they are different things. We can do a little experiment to make a cloud. It’ll make the cloud more visible that way. I put it on this overhead projector to get nice illumination of the chamber. But we’ll see if we can form a cloud this morning. Let me take questions for a minute about what I’ve done here. But I doubt that I can feel that temperature difference there. So that’s just leftover from–it could also be a little bit because I’m heating it from the bottom. That’s 100 cubed, because the volume of the sphere goes like the cube of the radius. But it needs something to trigger the freezing. Ice and water at the same temperature, the ice has a slightly lower saturation water vapor pressure. It will begin to fall out of the sky and may reach the ground as a snowflake if the temperature is warm enough. In which case, this will grow further by riming, by having supercooled droplets hit, and stick, and freeze when they hit. And as it fell, it melted and became a raindrop. Well, up here it’s going to be just like this one. Now I’m talking about a supercooled raindrop. Because it has a crystal structure very much like that of ice. If you put in too much, you’re going to freeze a large number of cloud droplets. To make this most effective, you want to freeze about one in a million of the cloud droplets. The field is beginning to come back now with a little higher level of statistical verification and beginning to become acceptable again scientifically. In order to do rain-fed agriculture, not irrigated agriculture, but rain-fed agriculture, you need about 20 centimeters of rain per year, about that much rain per year. And here’s the formula, 5.7, a constant that I’ve developed, times the temperature expressed in degrees Celsius, if you want millimeters per month. And you should make a note about that, that this is not a very accurate method for doing it because it’s ignored such factors as the one that was just mentioned."
460,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-12,"There is a latitudinal gradient of heat on the Earth caused by the tilt of the Earth’s axis with respect to the sun. This tilt produces seasonal fluctuations in heat input from the sun, as well as an excess of heat received on average annually near the equator. Heat is transferred poleward by both the ocean and atmosphere in an attempt to balance the Earth’s energy budget. The circulation of the Earth also causes a separation of the atmospheric circulation into three main circulation cells, each transporting heat towards the poles.","You did a lab this week, and it was a little bit–the weather discombobulated us a little bit. They are a little bit long, as you noticed. If you got anywhere in that vicinity, plus or minus 10, I wouldn’t worry about it. The partial pressure for water is the density for water times the gas constant for water times the temperature. So the gas constant for water is going to be the universal gas constant, 8,314, divided by the molecular weight for water. The molecular weight of oxygen is about 16. The two things you had to do, you had to compute the wavelength that was being most strongly emitted by each surface. By the time I convert that to Kelvin, it looks like maybe there’s now three. So that’s the density of air times the volume of the hemisphere. And the rate at which that pressure increases as you go down is related to the density of the surrounding fluid. And the familiar story, you’re going to form some condensed water droplets in that way, and that’s the fog. It’ll be just a minute for that light to come on. But that circulation, then, is going to move heat–because the air carries heat with it, it’s going to move heat from hot to cold regions trying to balance out the local heat budgets. And you can imagine starting with just this simple idea. It’s not going to deliver any solar energy that way. But the temperature of the pole is not absolute zero, so it will be radiating to space. Well, the way that is sustained is to have some other mechanism for transporting the heat from the Equator to the pole. So not only is the difference in heating going to produce a circulation by buoyancy forces, but that circulation then is going to solve this problem we have of how to balance out the heat budget at each latitude. But it’s definitely much less than what is received at the Equator, just because of the geometry of the sphere. What’s plotted here on the x-axis is the heat transport in watts–it’s a power unit–as a function of latitude. It says capital P, capital P capital W up there. So if we call this plot the northward heat transport, it’s positive in the Northern Hemisphere, because you’re transporting heat towards the North Pole. Typically, if you have warm air and cold air and the jet stream is running around the Earth kind of in a zonally symmetric fashion, well then, you’re not transporting any heat. But zonally, the heat gets well distributed because of the spinning of the Earth. This is the idealization or kind of a thought experiment of what the circulation would be if the Earth was not rotating on its axis. So the Coriolis force is playing a larger role. North and south of that, there is the Ferrel cell, which is a rather weak overturning in the opposite direction. And it’s looking at the emitted long-wave radiation. If we did that, it would go black, light, black, light as the Sun illuminated or not."
461,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-13,"The circulation in the atmosphere is composed of three circulation cells in the northern and southern hemispheres. These cells are caused by the rotation of the Earth which creates the Coriolis force. The Coriolis force deflects northern hemisphere motion to the right and southern hemisphere motion to the left. The majority of large-scale motion in the atmosphere is in geostrophic balance, meaning the Coriolis force acting on the motion is balanced by a pressure gradient force. The rotation of cyclones and anticyclones in the northern and southern hemispheres is controlled by this geostrophic balance.","Well, so we’re talking about the general circulation of the atmosphere. What this is, is a composite of several–Let me get my globe up here for a minute. Notice that the full globe seems to be illuminated. In other areas where there are high clouds, those cloud tops are cold. Any questions on that?So then when I put this into motion, I want you to watch for various things here. It’s actually a wavelength for which the atmosphere is rather opaque. And this belt of cloudiness, that you see over the oceans and then down over the continents, we call it the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and I’ll define it in just a moment, but it does move a little bit with season. Generally you’ve got high pressure, slightly higher average pressure around the globe in that belt. So it’s called sometimes the STHP, the Subtropical High Pressure, it’s also the belt of deserts, it’s where the air in the Hadley cell is descending. So, differential heating is the ultimate cause of all the atmospheric motion on our planet. But generally, pressure differences want to get the air moving. If I’ve got cold air here, and the wind is blowing, it’s going to carry that cold air to a different location. It acts at right angles to the motion vector. Omega is the rotation right of the Earth. In the Northern hemisphere, it acts to the right of the motion vector. And there’s no Coriolis force at the equator. Questions there?Let me do a little example, I put one up on the board here. Very often, we find that air is moving along, around the atmosphere, in the atmosphere, in a state of geostrophic balance. Well, this is more of a force balance in the horizontal. So you know it has to do something with the turning of the Earth, well, in this case it has to do with the Coriolis force. It is invalid, however, you do not have geostrophic force balance down in the frictional boundary layer, where there’s a lot of turbulence, or in strong storms or other disturbances. And so, you’ll notice that in this circumstance, instead of the air blowing from high pressure to low, like you would have expected, because of the Coriolis force, it moves along the isobars, not across them. First of all, I need a formula for the pressure gradient force, and that’s given by the pressure gradient times the volume of the object. About 50 miles between these different things. And I know what the direction is going to be too, because it’s going to be parallel to the isobars, with the high pressure on the right. But in meteorology, it has somewhat broader and less dangerous meaning. But now, we want to take a somewhat broader view of this, so I’m going to introduce–OK, this is a big jump, but I think we’re ready to do this. There’s high pressure down here, low pressure up there, you might expect the wind to be blowing from high to low, but no, it blows along the isobars instead."
462,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-14,Large scale air motion in the atmosphere occurring sufficiently above the surface is in geostrophic balance. Areas of high and low pressure anomalies in the atmosphere are surrounded by rotating flow caused by the balance between the pressure gradient and Coriolis forces. The direction of rotation around these pressure anomalies reverses between the northern and southern hemispheres due to the reversal in sign of the Coriolis force across the equator. This can be seen in the reverse direction of the spiraling of clouds in satellite images of hurricanes in the northern and southern hemispheres. Convective storms are also discussed.,"Well, we’re getting into weather, and so I’m going to be paying a bit more attention to what’s going on around us. But the data from which it is all derived are these little clusters. I showed you these little bullet points about geostrophic force balance. And of course, things have changed a bit between now and then. These values are sea-level pressure, so wherever the pressure was measured, it was reduced to a common altitude, sea level, and then the contours were laid on it. And when you’re analyzing your pilot balloon data in the lab–in lab number two, you might find some hint of that, some rotation of the wind in the boundary layer due to that breaking of the geostrophic law due to friction. Well, we’re going to be talking about mid-latitude cyclones probably next time, and this is an example where in addition to sketching in the isobars, they’ve also drawn in their interpretation of where the cold fronts and the warm fronts are on this particular day. And one of their jobs is to pump heat northward to balance the heat budget of the high latitudes and low latitudes, which I spoke about last time. And that process is called geostrophic adjustment. The Coriolis force is a deflecting force. No matter what direction you start that parcel, it’ll loop around in such a way that it’ll eventually end up in geostrophic balance. No, on the Coriolis– So this one is the pressure gradient force. And in this simple case, the pressure gradient force will always be towards the north, because the pressure decreases towards the north. And before he allowed us to go in the store, he wanted to prove to us that his store was the one that was really right on the Equator, and all those others we could see up and down the road were fake. He then went right under the sign–and that’s the picture you see there–and I noticed that his protocol was a little bit different. Remember, this kind of cloud occurs underneath a thunderstorm anvil. Now, they may be dangerous, but I don’t want to define it that way. Typically, they are short-lived, however. But you can’t define climate without understanding storms either. So holding them side by side is only a temporary thing. But first I want to start talking about the severe thunderstorms. So watch for that, because if you’re aware, you can tell the outflows coming from each of these storms as it progresses through the afternoon or the evening. So it’s going to move by the direction of the winds in the middle of the troposphere. Could be in some other direction if the regional winds are from a different direction. Because the updraft speeds are so large and there’s a lot of supercooled water above the zero degrees Celsius line, you can develop riming, which will then grow and grow and grow, and that hailstone can be suspended for maybe 15 or 20 minutes, even as it grows, because of the very strong updraft speed. But if you want to dig in or read about this, there’s a lot going on in research meteorology today to try to understand that question. And the way to prevent that, of course, is to open the windows so that pressure can equalize more rapidly."
463,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-15,"There are three main types of convective storms: airmass thunderstorms, severe thunderstorms and hurricanes. These storms are all driven by the release of latent heat into the atmosphere during condensation of water vapor. Severe thunderstorms include both squall line thunderstorms and tornados. They acquire energy from water vapor in the atmosphere over land and therefore typically require warm air temperatures and high humidity. Hurricanes gain energy from water vapor evaporated from the ocean surface. This requires warm ocean temperatures, and is the reason hurricanes weaken over land. Hurricanes are cyclonic and therefore also require a non-zero Coriolis force to form and maintain their structure. For this reason they cannot form over the equator and cannot cross the equator.","Well, I’m talking about storms, but someone asked me a question the other day about why the Coriolis force is opposite in the two hemispheres. So in a sense, while the globe spins eastward, the sense of rotation is opposite in the two hemispheres. And that is one way to understand why the Coriolis force is opposite in the two hemispheres. And so when you condense water, you’re then providing extra heat to the air, which makes it warmer, more buoyant. Strong winds near the tropopause, weak winds near the surface of the Earth, that tends to bend the storm over and change its structure into one in which the inflow is at a different location than the outflow caused by that evaporative cooling. Whereas this other thing here is the debris funnel. This is thunderstorm frequency across the United States, number of thunderstorms per year. So it really is kind of an East Coast phenomenon. So you’ve got zero to 24 and then 24 to 48. But if you notice, the plot just repeats as well. This is where a lot of thunderstorms form. In this case, my student discovered that it’s a disturbance generated over the Rockies that moves eastward and gives that progressive timing to the thunderstorms. I think they’re reference lines for some other figure in the paper that’s not shown here. Greenburg’s up here at the top of the screen. So you’re north of the county line, and the tornado, from your vantage point, is to the east of US 183, correct?Jay, a very large tornado. And it has been on the ground for probably 25 minutes, maybe even longer. And you’ve been watching this for quite a little while. He’s got the radar, and he’s looking at the reflectivity, which is telling you where the rain is falling. So we’re going to continue, and I think that’s–yeah, so that’s all we have on severe thunderstorms. So this is a cyclone in the same sense that I defined cyclone for you the other day. I’ve published on this, but I don’t have time to go through it. So these are the global hurricane tracks. In the eastern tropical North Pacific, you have a very high density of hurricanes. Remember, these are not occurring simultaneously. It’s like a thunderstorm anvil, except it’s kind of axisymmetric. Clear of clouds means sinking air, thermodynamically. Underneath this, you can’t see it, but the winds are strong in the cyclonic direction. So hurricane damage, of course, wind impact on buildings and vegetation."
464,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-16,"Mid-latitude frontal cyclones gain energy from temperature gradients rather than latent heat release as is the case with convective storms. They form in the belt of westerly winds and therefore generally move west to east in both the northern and southern hemispheres. A mid-latitude frontal cyclone develops from a kink in the polar front, and eventually warm and cold fronts develop around a low pressure center to form the storm. An example of this type of storm is a nor’easter, which commonly occurs in New England and is named for the northeasterly winds that precede the storm’s arrival. Weather forecasting is also discussed.","We’re finishing up a section on storms here, and we’ve talked about convective storms. It ends up being a counterclockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere, just like a hurricane. But the dynamics and the details are really quite different, even though they end up with a circulation around a low pressure center, just like a hurricane. And you’ve got the light snow here, heavy snow back in the cold air. A cold front, indicated by the filled triangles, is when the cold air is advancing. So we know, because that’s defined as a cold front, we know that it’s moving in this direction. This one, the warm air is here, the cold air there. So this plays a big role in the general circulation as well. And already you can see the characteristics. The cold air begins to advance, so we can label that as a cold front. And where it hits the ground is where it’s marked on this map. Here–cirrus, cirrostratus, altostratus, nimbostratus. And then, at different places it’ll be doing different things. Yeah, a stationary front is a definite cold-warm contrast, but it’s not moving. They don’t happen with great periodicity. I think every field likes to put names on things. One answer is that they’re traveling northeast. But remember, this is a traditional term. And the winds are going to be traveling right around like that, paralleling the isobars. Other questions on this?So, a lot of famous storms. The blizzard of 1978–the one I mentioned, here in New Haven–here’s a satellite image of it. And then, have you heard of    This book by Sebastian Junger became quite a best seller describing a storm that hit the Grand Banks and sank a fisher boat, the Andrea Gail. You’ve got the cold front, the warm front, the occluded front, the cyclone, strong winds, and so on, producing big waves and sunk that little–So you can read about that in Junger’s book. And if you’re sailing on a clipper ship 150 years ago, out of England, trying to reach somewhere–First of all, remember that the way you would do that–the winds down here are westerlies, just as they are in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes. And you’d come this way and then come back around. So that’s basically the way the forecast system works. And of course, people are trying to compute out still further in time. So what about your New Haven weekend?It’s not my job to give you an indication of the forecast. And generally the whole thing is creeping eastward."
465,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-17,"There are several factors that impact climate on Earth. Different areas on Earth have different climates depending on factors such as their latitude and surrounding terrain. Maps of annual average precipitation illustrate these variations in climate. Continentality also affects climate based on the ability to change temperatures on land versus in the oceans and also the imbalance of land mass between the northern and southern hemispheres. Seasonality is a dominant factor in climate. It is controlled by the amount of solar insolation received at the Earth’s surface, which varies in time due to the tilt of the Earth’s rotation axis.","We’re starting a new subject and I wanted to just remind you what we’ve done, so you see how this fits into the larger picture. Now we’re moving into some other sections that are a little more descriptive. So the definition of climate is not quite cut and dried, but I would say that for the most part, you need those 24 numbers in order to describe the climate of any particular place on the Earth. So just to remind you about the general circulation, you’ve got the symmetry about the equator, with a Hadley cell rising near the equator sending air poleward in both hemispheres, descending near the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, and then the trade winds under the influence of the Coriolis force–these winds don’t move directly back towards the equator. So it’s not just latitude control, as this diagram would have you think, but it also depends where you are because of the mountains, the continents, and the ocean currents. So when you look at an annual precip map–this is for land only. You do see the latitudinal control from the general circulation. They have to climb over the mountains there. By the time you get west of–into Colorado–and then eastward of that you’re gradually starting to pick up your precipitation again. So this is a nice example of orographic precipitation. Look at the contrast between the eastern and western part of the state. In the north, you’re getting very low precipitation, because as I mentioned, the air that gets to those very high polar latitudes is cold. And the cooling has probably already removed most of its water vapor. So a very strong example of orographic precipitation. So you can’t just heat or cool the top few centimeters. Alaska has a very small annual range near the ocean. In the northern hemisphere, they’re going clockwise. How do the seasons work in different parts of the world?So just five bullet points concerning seasons. That is our reference plane, and relative to that plane, the tilt is measured, the tilt of the Earth spinning on its axis. That orientation stays fixed as it goes around. And the north pole will have sunlight 24 hours a day. And they were asked, what makes the seasons. Now I will try to describe that in various ways. So that cosine effect is another important way to understand how the seasons work. It drops very rapidly as you go later in the year, and at a certain point it drops altogether. And that’s because the amount of radiation is almost the same between the pole and the equator. In the southern hemisphere, the ITCZ shifts southwards, and you have weak frontal storms in the southern hemisphere, because there’s very little difference between the solar insolation here and there."
466,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-18,The seasonal cycle on Earth causes shifts in the bands of precipitation in the northern and southern hemispheres. The polar front shifts between high and mid-latitudes which causes a latitudinal shift in the occurrence of frontal cyclones. The Intertropical Convergence Zone also shifts across the equator bringing bands of precipitation to different tropical regions throughout the year. Regional climates on Earth have been classified based on temperature and precipitation values. Areas affected by seasonal shifts in the ITCZ and polar front are included in this classification scheme. Several examples of seasonality are discussed as well as seasonal weather and climate events.,"I wanted to start out just by reminding you, we’ve already talked about how the tilt of the Earth drives the seasons. And so we sat there in their living room for a few hours. He’d been playing soccer with his friends down the street. Any questions on that?So we’re going to pick up on this seasonal theme. So six months later–December, January, February–the Sun is hitting the Southern Hemisphere more, so all the belts and zones–which, remember, are driven by the Sun, differential heating by the Sun, so it’s not surprising that they can shift when the source of the heating shifts–they all shift southwards. In the Indian Ocean, however, you have an exaggerated shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. This is Southern Hemisphere, so this would be a summertime rainfall maxima. And this is all cloud-free and not getting any precipitation at that time. Weak, of course, because the pole and the Equator are getting about the same amount of sunlight. So that is a mark of this kind of a phenomenon, where it’s getting its rain from frontal cyclones that have moved equatorward in the cool season. There’s the temperature in red, and it’s in the cool season of the year. There are some things in weird directions. For example, the arrows here pointing towards the east, October 1. But once in his life, he traveled down to Egypt. Why does the Nile behave the opposite to other rivers? The source of the Nile, we now know, is up in the Horn of Africa, over in this region, and that has a summertime precipitation. The arid climates’ precipitation annual total, less than 10 PTH. In the springtime, you tend to get these severe thunderstorms that occur in that part of the world, because you get the right jet stream aloft and the moist air coming in from the Gulf of Mexico. The reason why the winter is so dry is because in the wintertime, those storms coming from the Pacific lose their rain in the Rockies. Well, you see here, everywhere you look, old places where that river used to be. Now, as you first glance at that, you may say, well, they look a lot alike. There’s quite a bit down here in eastern Pennsylvania. A little bit in Connecticut up around Springfield in Massachusetts. And some places in Connecticut you find some agriculture. During the summertime, most of the rain that falls evaporates, and much less flows down the river to the sea. In November, next month, it looks so different."
467,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-19,"Plate tectonics and ocean bathymetry are discussed. Bathymetry is the study of ocean depth, which is affected in some regions by plate tectonics and mantle dynamics. Mid-ocean ridges are formed at plate boundaries where mantle material is rising to the ocean crust and solidifying as it cools to form new ocean crust material. Seamounts are volcanoes that have formed from molten mantle material pushing up through the ocean crust, but these volcanoes lie below sea level. These features are measured using acoustic depth profiling. Ocean water properties, such as temperature and salinity, as well as the methods used to measure them are also discussed.","We are starting a brand new subject today. We’re just going to touch on it briefly, because this isn’t a course in geology, but I need to do it because you can’t understand the bathymetry of the oceans without understanding a bit about plate tectonics. I’m not going to spend too much time on it. Maybe it’s a subduction zone, maybe it’s a new–new plate material being formed, but that’s the way we try to understand the structure of the earth these days is to understand where are these plates, and how do their edges deform as the plates move around. Whereas most of the others, not the Nazca plate, but the Australian plate, has ocean crust plus continental crust. Or the way this coast kind of could fit in against here. And then as time progressed it split up, first with a seaway that came through this way, and then eventually you begin to get the Atlantic ocean opening up, and today you have something like this. Now if there were twice as much liquid water available on the planet, that distinction would be less important because the water level would be here, and it would cover both the ocean crust and the continental crust. The amount of water we have on the planet probably did come out of the interior of the planet over geologic time, but it’s just an accident that it happens to be deep enough to cover the ocean crust but not the continental crust. It would have some average height, and then less above, and less below. So this is a cartoon just showing some of the features. On occasion you find them with flat tops, which means that at one point they reached the ocean surface and were leveled by wave action. You see then geologically, a continental shelf is really part of the continent. And you see something very similar here, where cold waters being peeled off and come up here to keep the southern tropical Atlantic a bit cool as well. Otherwise it’s pretty warm in the tropics, except where you’re getting these cool currents. So this is not a picture that can then be transferred down into the ocean very deep at all. So the basic story behind this narrow range of salinity, is that the ocean is, at least for salt, relatively well mixed. Remember when you evaporate seawater, you leave the salt behind, and so the salinity is going to be increased. The old way to do this, and I’ll talk about the new ways too, the old way for about 50 years, the predominant way for sounding the ocean, for getting temperature and salinity profiles with depth, was the Nansen bottle. And then down here the cable comes through there, and you lock it with a turn buckle. And of course, the pressure is enormous at the bottom of the ocean, you can do a quick hydrostatic calculation to understand you can get hundreds of atmospheres of pressure down there. However that of course would not give you a water sample, so if you want to do any kind of water chemistry a CTD would not be sufficient. The CTD is a great advance on that, but it doesn’t give you the water sample. And then every, I don’t know, 500 meters or so, you might close one of the valves on these bottles and you get a water sample from that depth as well. So if you were to go out on an oceanographic cruise today, you’d be largely using the CTD and the rosette to do vertical profiling of temperature and salinity."
468,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-1,"This course studies the atmosphere and the ocean as parts of Earth’s climate system. The climate is studied in both quantitative and qualitative ways through use of the textbook, lectures, labs and problem sets. Today’s lecture includes an examination of Hurricane Irene that hit Connecticut a few days ago on August 28. For this, we use several website sources of local weather information: satellite, radar, tide gauges. The atmosphere is gravitationally attracted to the Earth and is composed of gases that are invisible to the human eye. We are able to detect the presence of the atmosphere through our perceptions of the presence of air and changes in pressure.","I’m Professor Ron Smith from the Department of Geology and Geophysics. And everybody that takes the lab takes this course. Why does Central Africa have a different climate than Connecticut, which is different from Southern California, which is different from, well, any place? Now I’ve already mentioned this but the way you’re going to be studying this course, there are about five to six different things you need to be looking at for sources of information: the book, my lectures, which are more quantitative, the problem sets, which are quantitative. So for example, when you walk to class every morning, and for some of you, it’s a good walk, instead of just turning on your iPod or zoning out, start to look up and around, and try to figure out what’s going on that day. Now I want to tell you something about this because you’re all online several times a day probably. And of course, you don’t have to do it that way. But you don’t have to be satisfied with that. And what you see here is that the sea water level rose quite a bit above what was predicted from the normal tides. It’s too small for you read from the back, so I’ll try to walk through it. This is in knots, which is a traditional unit of wind speed. And the cyclone is like this, winds going around in that direction. And you see this nice heavy rain shield out here. And the best way to do that is with the Upton radar because that will tell you–New Haven’s right there. Another great one, of course, is the satellites. So it stays over the same point on the equator. And it’s taking a picture about every ten minutes. Now, also notice these clouds are quite different than the ones up here. The radar shows that these were not precipitating, but these were. So my interests today are primarily in what I call regional climates. So that’s my definition of an atmosphere. And then the final step of this experiment is I’m just going to open a door. Now, I misled you in another way too, the way I’ve drawn that. Whereas the depth of the atmosphere–it’s a little bit hard to define the depth of the atmosphere because it has a gradual top. So we’re going to put that into a context next time. I remember when I was in the navy years ago, first part of flight training school, they wanted to show us what it was like to have a sudden decompression. And then all of a sudden, they opened the valve. And a cloud formed in our chamber just like that. And that happens, by the way, extremely fast, like in a fraction of a second. Then when you suddenly come up, that gas bubbles out of solution, like taking a can of Coke and shaking it basically. So the atmosphere has a great protective role to play in allowing us to exist on this planet."
469,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-20,"Stability in the ocean is based on the density of the water. Density must increase with depth in order for the ocean to be stable. Density is a function of both temperature and salinity, with cold salty water having a higher density than warm fresh water. Temperature and salinity in the ocean can be affected by the atmosphere. Heat can be added to or removed from the ocean, and precipitation and evaporation change the salinity of the ocean. Surface winds also act as a forcing mechanism on the ocean by creating a wind stress forcing which pushes surface waters.","So now we are into this new section of the course, oceanography. And that’s why there are these vast areas of the ocean that are at about the same depth below sea level, these abyssal planes. One is that the ocean density depends not just on temperature, but on salinity too. So we’ll have to take into account both of those quantities. That affect is very, very small in the oceans. So because of these two differences, the idea of what determines stability in the atmosphere and the ocean are significantly different. So once again, the ocean was found to be stable. These balloons of data are superimposed on a diagram that has lines of constant density on it. So you would read this as 1,028.5 kilograms per cubic meter. She’s usually most interested in understanding the salinity field because the salinity field hacking down here, as you can see, is more in control of the density field in the colder regions of the ocean. It flows Northward along the bottom of the ocean, and we find it in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. And that, of course, has to do with atmospheric controls, which I’m just about to get to. These two things will change the salinity of the surface, and therefore, the density. Whereas in the blue, and you notice it coincides with the ITCZ, for example, where you have heavy precipitation, precipitation exceeds evaporation. So the sign of this quantity of negative shows up as blue. So here I’ve repeated those three ways in which the atmosphere forces the ocean. The mass per unit area, if you think of a piece of the ocean, a little cylinder of area A, its total mass is going to be its volume times the density of the water. So then let me just take that and plug it into this formula. Let’s say we have sunlight hitting the surface of the ocean with that kind of intensity. When it evaporates it leaves all the salt behind, so you can say that I’m subtracting fresh water. With that geometric interpretation, I can write the ratio in my formula M over M as being capital D over capital D plus little d. In other words, I’m just adding water, and that’s going to change the mass ratio before and after. That allows me to rewrite this formula finally to–can you see it if I do it here?So I’m going to take this formula, divide through by the S1 and use little added formula. Let’s do an extreme example to be sure this formula’s correct. So that would affect this top 100 meters. If I had made it more dense, it might find itself so dense that it would then fall to the bottom of the ocean."
470,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-21,"The atmosphere forces the ocean in three ways: addition and removal of heat, precipitation and evaporation, and wind stress. The former two processes influence the density of sea water. Gravity acts on these density differences to cause large-scale thermohaline currents Wind driven ocean currents are forced by the wind stress acting on the ocean surface which indirectly causes geostrophic currents.","I’m going to go over the exam first thing here. OK so problem one, I show you a top view of a Focault pendulum. And then when it’s swinging back and this force acts on it, it’s going to deflect it a little bit like that. Explain how cool winds and a gust wind are created by a thunderstorm. So on a map view, north, south, east, west, the question states that the pressure is greater towards the west because it’s high pressure over here relative to low pressure over there. And if we can assume that the air is in geostrophic balance, the Coriolis force must be equal and opposite to that. So that the Coriolis force is to the right of the wind motion. You could state that as a northerly wind if you wanted, but the direction will be towards the south. And the Sun is illuminating the cloud, but is also seeing radiation that’s been scattered–I don’t have to draw another beam there. For the cloud itself, the particles are much larger. Why are hurricanes not found over the sea near the equator? And you want to know when beads of water would form on the outside. Basically the ocean is driven by the atmosphere above it in these three ways. But if you average that out, the net of all that motion is directly to the right of the wind stress. So if you had a wind, say, from the southwest to the northeast, giving you wind stress in that direction–that’s the black arrow–and you gave it a few hours to come into this new state of balance called the Ekman force balance, that force would be balanced by the Coriolis force, and if that’s going to be the Coriolis force, then the Ekman transport must be in that direction. Now, this is not identical with the geostrophic balance. The old sea captains would make notes of that in their log. If you add a layer of fresh water to the ocean of thickness little d, and then you mix that in to some layer of depth D, there’s how the salinity will change. The temperature and salinity will in turn change the density of the seawater. So it’s not super cooled water because the salt actually depresses the sea level by a degree or two. So let me look at the salinity field here. And these motions are driven by these slow thermohaline-driven currents. So they can communicate and close this circulation by running the currents down through the southern Ocean. That would be called a thermohaline circulation. So that’s what we’re going to be looking for. So the winds over the ocean, for example, in the Atlantic Ocean, the winds in the tropical regions are from east to west. The Ekman flux will be towards the north. We’ll talk about how these currents get moving."
471,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-22,"Ocean currents are generally divided into two categories: thermohaline currents and wind driven currents. Both types of currents are forced remotely rather than locally. Wind driven currents are initially forced by the wind stress causing water to pile up in certain locations. This produces a pressure gradient, which is then balanced by the Coriolis force and geostrophic currents develop. The gyre circulations found in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are wind driven currents. There is a connection between the physics of these currents and the biological productivity in the ocean. For example, productivity is greatest in areas of equatorial and coastal upwelling as nutrient rich deep water is brought to the sunlit surface.","We are right in the middle of a section on oceanography. Wind driven is driven by the wind stresses at the surface of the ocean. Now, the problem with this nice, clean categorization is that there are some ocean currents that seem to be driven by a mix of the two things. So at that point, it seems to be more of a thermohaline current. They do, however, extend, in some cases, right down to the bottom of the ocean. As opposed to wind driven currents, which are usually in the upper kilometer, so the upper fifth or so, of the ocean column. But what explains this blob of salty water is actually that outflow from the Mediterranean Sea. Some of the Gulf Stream, however, breaks off and becomes the North Atlantic Drift, which eventually goes into the Arctic Ocean. And the Labrador Current, in a sense, goes a little bit opposite to the North Atlantic Gyre, as well. And notice that this would be the region of the trade winds. You’ve got that chain of events, the Ekman layer, the piling up of the water, and then the geostrophic currents. OK, it does weaken as you go out, as I’ll show you in a minute. However, you can still see remnants of it further across the ocean. So when you’re approaching that, you can often see it at quite some distance, because you see cumulus clouds are building up over the Gulf Stream Questions?Now, what about this Gulf of Mexico thing, that’s rather interesting. It changes from week to week, and it goes through a cycle. But I will say that they–there are certain parallels. It pretty much goes all the way around Antarctica. And then, as part of that, or consistent with that, is a current that runs kind of across the basin, from one side to the other, called the Transpolar Drift. And as I’ll be showing you, there are vast parts of the ocean that are devoid of any primary productivity. You start with single-celled life that are plants. Where you’ve got nutrients, you don’t have the light. So in a way, it’s detecting those phytoplankton directly, because they have chlorophyll in their bodies. So the purple areas are biological deserts. Well, that’s because that warm water lens doesn’t extend to high latitudes. That water must then be replaced by upwelling. Well, if you look at, for example, where the Amazon River comes in, where the Mississippi comes in, where some of the other major rivers come in, you see little red regions. By the time the have lounged up and down the promenade…”OK. They didn’t know it was because of a shift in the Ekman layer, but we know that now, that you have a zone there of high productivity. Next, on Wednesday, I’m going to be talking about El Nino, which you can read about in the book."
472,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-23,"The El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is the primary mode of variability in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. It is composed of two extreme states, El Niño and La Niña. The oscillation between these states can be seen in measurements of sea surface temperature (SST), sea level pressure, thermocline depth, and easterly trade wind strength. Changes in SST and pressure lead to shifting of convective activity across the equatorial Pacific. Changes in the strength of the easterly trade winds lead to changes in the depth of the thermocline, which affect coastal upwelling offshore of South America. If upwelling is reduced, primary productivity is reduced. The effect of ENSO on convection and coastal upwelling makes it an important factor for both agriculture and fishing industries.","Well we’re going to talk about El Niño today. So El Niño is a naturally occurring oscillation in the Pacific Ocean between two rather distinct states. Let me go through these two diagrams to kind of get it started. If you say a warm pool to an oceanographer or to an atmospheric scientist, they know that you’re referring, or they suspect you’re referring to the Western Pacific because there we get the warmest ocean temperatures anywhere on the globe, at least during this phase of the El Niño, La Niña cycle. In the Eastern Tropical Pacific you have generally higher air pressure. I’m going to start out with a lot of attention paid to this region. So a year ago there was La Niña, and near the end of the presentation I’ll bring that up to date, we’ll see what state the Tropical Pacific has today. So during La Niña, you have generally a steeply inclined thermocline, deeper in the Western Pacific with lots of warm water then. During El Niño, and indeed, these are anomalies I believe, rather than absolute temperatures. So you just subtract the normal–I think some of the plots you’re working with in lab this week, some of that data was given to you in terms of anomaly, rather than the actual temperature. But you can log in, you can just go to their website at anytime day or night and get current data for what the ocean is doing in this part of the world. And then below that is the SOI, the Southern Oscillation Index, which is defined as the pressure difference, it’s Tahiti minus Darwin. One is a sea surface temperature, one is an atmospheric pressure. So there’s the warm pool, and the temperature is given here so there’s actually temperatures higher than 28 degrees Celsius in the warm pool. So it never was really an El Niño I would say. So at each time you can see what the strength of the trade winds were across the Pacific Ocean. Here is the temperature anomaly in degrees Celsius for a few days ago. And there is warmer than usual ocean water beneath the surface, but not much of an anomaly at the surface in the Western Tropical Pacific. You come out of that thing about 12 months after you went into it. Yeah, so it may be–I put the emphasis on the Eastern part, maybe I shouldn’t have done that. And that would probably correspond to this. This is the 850 hectoPascal level, which is about a kilometer and a half above the ocean surface. In one case you freeze seawater, the other case you just compact snow. Remember, the latent heat of condensation was many times that number. That the solid is actually less dense then the liquid. Typical density for fresh water is about 1,000. So this is less dense than both of those, and would float either in fresh water or in seawater."
473,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-24,"Five types of ice in the climate system are discussed. Sea ice forms when ocean water reaches its freezing temperature of about -2°C. Sea ice is currently found in the Arctic Ocean and around Antarctica. Ice sheets form on land and are composed of compacted snow that has accumulated over time. Ice sheets spread over a land surface and can reach the ocean. If the ice continuity is maintained when the ice sheet reaches the ocean, the ice will float on the water and this is referred to as an ice shelf. Icebergs are large chunks of glaciers that break off into the ocean. They can become grounded in shallow water, but generally are moved by the wind and ocean currents. Mountain glaciers form on mountains and are typically found at high latitudes, but also occur near the equator at sufficiently high elevation.","As you know, because we just got this subject started last time, I’m going to talk today about ice in the climate system. So we’ll be going through those subjects today. That would be the minimum in the sea ice. But if you mechanically stack it up, which happens in some parts, you can get it to be about the height of this room, three or four meters high. So the way we monitor sea ice in the Southern Hemisphere typically is by the maximum sea ice that you grow. But there’s even a more obvious answer than that. It is true the polar bears walking around. It’s hard to do that if you’re just walking around on the ice with some kind of way of drilling through. And then near the end you get a negative anomaly. Questions on that?So the Southern Hemisphere, again September. And in the last–well, at least in 2007, and in this year, there’s actually a northern sea route along the north coast of Russia that you could use also to get back and forth between the two oceans. And there’s two things you have to know to understand this. It may be only a meter per day or even a meter per week. But nevertheless, they balance this annual accumulation of snow on the high parts of the ice sheet. There may be a kilometer or more of ice beneath you. And you don’t have any sense of that slow creeping motion, at least not here where it’s smooth. Some would say, well, it doesn’t really mean anything, because that ice has already left the continent. But it can be argued one way or the other. And at some point, it does float out over water. We’re going to right on to icebergs then. So we say that icebergs are formed from calving. That’ll happen suddenly, without any warning. And it happens kind of in a dramatic fashion, as you saw there. So that is a solid derivation of why it is that most of the iceberg is below sea level there. If the channel with the fjord is still choked with ice, does it make any difference whether the calving is here or the calving is–I would think it would make a difference. And some of it is accomplished by just sliding the ice along the bottom. The water will get to the sea, but not the ice itself. And if you trace them back, each one of them originates at a point like this. And that will at least give you the speed of the ice at the top of the glacier. And then if you see that river, even miles away, it’ll have that characteristic milky appearance."
474,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-25,"Ice on earth is sensitive to climate change and ice plays a role in climate change processes. Recent trends in the Greenland ice sheet provide an important example. Over the past two decades the extent of surface melt water on the ice sheet has increased. In addition, satellites have detected a decrease in the overall mass of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Paleoclimate is also discussed in this lecture, with a focus on climate over the last 5 million years. The mid-Pliocene was a particularly warm period from 3.3-3 million years before present. The Pleistocene was a more recent cold period ending with the Last Glacial Maximum about 14,000 years before present. In comparison, the Holocene (12,000 years ago to present) has been a relatively warm stable climatic period. Geomorphology is used to determine the extent of continental ice in the past.","I put the word—the number seven billion there because according to what I read in the newspaper, this was the weekend where the world’s population just increased past seven billion. So it’s a subtle indication, maybe not so subtle, that things are changing when you can get a nor’easter coming while the leaves are still on the trees. So more of a sloppy snow than anything else. And some, of course, don’t get down that far. We’ve spent some time talking about those. And what’s shown–so you can fly a satellite over, look down, and by the way light reflects off the ice sheet, you could determine whether or not the snow is wet–whether it’s got melt water mixed in with the snow. So you know within a millimeter or so the distance between those two satellites as they move. The other for Northwest Greenland up here. Or if you have a mountain glacier, a small mountain glacier with sliding gravitationally, that would be a glacier as well. The Pliocene vegetation–now, there’s no legend on this diagram, but the author wanted to make the point that the normal forests that we have here at mid-latitudes, at that time extended all the way up into the Canadian archipelago up into Alaska. Here is a diagram showing human evolution. On average it was much colder than the present day. So some would argue when I say that the Holocene climate was constant. In a way this is the most fun because we can do it ourselves. But this is where the snout of that glacier was. So the river, instead of being a depression in this case as we’re used to seeing, because there was a river up inside a glacier, actually leaves an elevated tongue marking where that river was. Usually underneath the ice there are chunks of rock embedded in the ice. So it didn’t come from there, it was carried in by somewhere else. So that’s a little bit of what you can look for as you drive around to convince yourselves that there was big ice on the landscape not too long ago. So I want to spend a few slides just describing what the Earth was like during this Last Glacial Maximum. Roughly 20,000 to 14,000 years before present. However, there are also large ice sheets in Scandinavia and Northern Russia as well. Down in our part of the country, it was from north to south. One of the reasons they put a different name on the Cordilleran ice sheet is because you see some eastern movement here, which conflicts with what the Laurentide ice sheet movement has been. Then retreated slightly and built up another terminal moraine. One of the best ways to do this is by looking at the stable isotopes of water. This means they evaporate more slowly and they condense more readily."
475,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-26,"Isotopes are used to measure past climate properties. Deuterium and oxygen 18 are the most commonly used climate proxies. Lighter isotopes evaporate more readily from the ocean, so water vapor in the atmosphere is isotopically lighter than ocean water. This vapor gets lighter still as it is transported to higher latitudes while losing mass by precipitation. These processes leave an isotopic signal of temperature and continental ice volume in ice cores and deep sea sediment cores.","Well, today I’m going to finish up a two-lecture description of paleoclimatology and the ice ages, and then starting on Friday, I’ll go into the subject of global warming. We talked about the last glacial maximum. Because of eight protons, it has eight positive charges. It’ll have eight electrons going around it. Or you could replace the oxygen 16 by 18 and one of the hydrogens by deuterium, but again, that is so rare that I’m not interested in it. So if there’s questions here, let me go back over this. And so that delta value turns out to be zero if it is ocean water you are sampling. And the vapor is even lighter than that vapor. Why are evapotranspiration and the vapor—the second vapor–different numbers? It has nothing to do it all with how the atmosphere works. Source changes or changes in that progressive fractionation in the atmosphere. Here they’ve written it as delta 2H. Remember 2H is what we’re calling deuterium. For example, for delta D, the delta values are much larger. But if this were much colder, you would remove a much larger fraction, maybe three quarters of the water vapor, that would fractionate more strongly, and you’d get lighter isotopes falling on the ice sheet. At the top of the ice core, you had about 280 parts per million by volume, which is about the value we think is the pre-industrial carbon dioxide value for the Earth’s atmosphere. Carbon dioxide concentration and temperature are very similar. Most of the time, when you see such rock patterns, you’re looking at some kind of evidence of ancient climate change. These changes probably are telling us something about changes in the ancient climate of the Earth. So the way we do that is to do deep ocean drilling. We expect that sample of oxygen is going to be slightly heavier isotopically than the ocean water, because when the organism makes its shell, it slightly prefers the heavier isotope. The first papers on this thought it was this. And that’s the signal we hope to see in the deep sea sediment cores. You don’t have to lower the ocean very much in order to expand it out a bit—expand the continents out, because there’s some shallow submerged land today. And the point I want to make here is that the gap between Asia and North America was actually bridged at that time because of a lowered sea level. And I think that’s all I have to talk about today."
476,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-27,"The issue of global warming is discussed. Recent climate change over the last half of the 20 century is thought to be driven largely by greenhouse gas emissions, with carbon dioxide playing a large role. The carbon cycle describes the reservoirs of carbon (atmosphere, terrestrial biomass and ocean) and the exchanges that occur between these reservoirs. Inputs of carbon to the atmosphere include burning of fossil fuels and respiration from biomass. Vegetation also removes carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, and a similar uptake of carbon from the atmosphere occurs in the ocean through biological processes. Residence time for carbon in the atmosphere can be computed and is estimated to be a few hundred years. Atmospheric carbon dioxide has been measured directly since the 1950s, and longer records exist over geologic time from ice core data.","OK, so we are starting this new subject, which is a really important one. The idea that just 14,000 years ago, we had a thick layer of ice covering over much of what is today open, useful land. Now, these each have their own characteristics, but on a scientific front, they all were true revolutions. But that is another significant input of CO, is the making of cement from natural calcium carbonate that was precipitated in the oceans by either living or non-living processes. From the soil, the tree is getting water and it’s getting nutrients, like nitrogens and phosphorus, but almost all of the carbon to build a tree trunk is coming from the atmosphere. And we were flying an aircraft around the island. One of the sensors we had on the airplane was a carbon dioxide sensor so we could measure how much carbon dioxide was in the atmosphere upstream of the island, over the island, and downstream of the island. You can measure this in lots of other ways. So I want to emphasize that the biosphere is a very active player in this carbon cycle. But I would say, for example, in most of these New England forests, most of the ancient tree material is going back into the atmosphere. If you want to know what the mass of the carbon dioxide is, be sure to include the mass of the two oxygens that are on the carbon dioxide. The difference, however, is rather small. You’ve seen it before, but that’s a central part of our argument. There’s the cement production, about 6.5. So residence time is for CO.On the month by month, on the seasonal basis, I’ll take that 760 gigatons and divide it–here I’m just using the atmospheric number. I get even a shorter time if I use, if I put the ocean numbers in there as well. And then on top of that, you’ve got a trend, which you can see from the smoothed line here. Here is carbon dioxide concentration in parts per million by volume. We can go back even further in geologic time. But maybe this is even a more powerful argument, because that carbon we’re putting it has a certain isotopic signature. So instead I have said, it is the highest it’s been in several million years. It’s probably safe to say there’s never been a time in Earth’s history where the CO is increasing as rapidly as it is today, where the rate has been as large. This, by the way, is the period when the Vikings colonized Greenland. The black curve is an average from a number of different proxy data sets. And then there’s some wiggles near the end that we’ll talk about in just a minute."
477,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-28,"The current Holocene epoch is considered to be a time period of relatively stable climate compared to earlier geological periods. Still, some significant changes in temperature and sea level did occur. These climatic fluctuations include the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, and more recently global warming. Temperature data for the 20 century shows a strong warming from about 1970 to the present day, typically associated with anthropogenic forcing including greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions. Volcanic eruptions also caused slight variations in the climate during the 20 century (e.g. Pinatubo in 1991). Aerosols released during a volcanic eruption are quickly distributed around the globe and act to increase the atmospheric albedo and block solar radiation. Therefore volcanic eruption signatures in climate data appear as short term decreases in temperature. General circulation models have been used to simulate the climate of the 20 century using both natural and anthropogenic climate forcings. These models indicate that anthropogenic forcings are likely responsible for the most recent rise in temperature.","Well, we are now in the middle of a section on global warming. And we spent Friday looking at how carbon dioxide levels have changed in the atmosphere. I want to talk briefly today about the Year Without a Summer. It was abandoned, of course, when we got into the Little Ice Age. And that was recorded in many different ways, not only in art, but in many of the economic and other records of the time. Not only because of this event, but that’s when new lands are becoming open to settlement in the Midwest, in the Ohio Valley, for example, where the soils were better than in New England. People doubt that it had much of an influence in the southern hemisphere because by the time those volcanic materials in the stratosphere made their way into the southern hemisphere their density was pretty small. His daily hand written temperature records throughout that event are there, and if you’re a historian interested in that kind of thing, you might want to go look those up. And of course, the evidence has to do with where people were living. And now very often you’ll find in the global warming skeptic literature the point made–and it’s a good one, but I’ll address it–that the carbon dioxide rise has been much smoother than that. I’ll address that just a minute, but we do want to come up with some explanation for this kind of irregularity in the growth–in the increase in temperature during the 20th century. There’s extra information to be gained by looking at the continents and the oceans separately. And the word global in the phrase global warming is a little problematic I think, too–I mentioned it here–because I think it tends to overstate the uniformity of the warming. So many GCMs are in this business of trying to model climate and how it changes with these different inputs. So the model continues to capture the drops connected with volcanic input, because that’s included in what they call natural forcing. But it shows basically a flat and even cooling climate after 1940, and missing entirely this increase that was caused–well, the decrease here caused by the sulfates, and then the increase caused by the eventual dominance of the CO.So I don’t like models as a way to prove things, but they are—they do give us a clue that these inputs are important, and some of these inputs are anthropogenic. And it could be either long wave forcing or short wave forcing. And here’s how–we’ll be coming back and talk about this diagram again. The rate here is about three centimeters per decade. Because it’s a greenhouse gas, it can radiate. And they’ve got–the year is plotted on the x-axis. Global warming of about 0.8 degrees Celsius. Most of the mountain glaciers are in retreat. Stratospheric cooling, and the deciduous growing season is longer. And this cartoon tends to get that across."
478,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-29,"Several greenhouse gas emissions scenarios have been developed by the IPCC to determine possible affects on atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and related climate warming. The largest estimates show a carbon dioxide concentration of about 800ppmv by the year 2100. Lower estimates rise to 450ppmv by the year 2100. The amount of projected warming associated with these emissions scenarios range from about 2-4°C. Several possible disadvantages and advantages of such a warming are discussed, as well as possible methods to reduce global warming.","OK, so the first question was one of the most difficult ones on the exam, I believe. Now for that you needed this diagram on the next page. I just subtracted that from the 35 to get the new salinity. And because that is light isotopes, because of the evaporation process, that’s going to make the oceans heavy. Questions on that?In recent centuries we have a perihelion in January. Explain how the climate would be different if due to procession– All right, so let me put on the board this side review of the plane of the ecliptic. Anyway in the arctic, sea ice is rapidly decreasing. In the southern ocean it’s approximately constant by the measure I’ve just described. Do you guys know what the average is on this? Now again, the primary reference here is the IPCC reports. And that’s what we’re going to talk about today. But from the articles I’ve read recently, it looks like we’re a bit closer to the higher projections than we are to the lower ones, if you look what’s happened over the last five years. So here is up to the present day, this is actual data, and here’s the constant composition commitment curve that you saw beginning to peel off in the previous one. So that’s a warming of about–again this is based on this reference, not pre-industrial–but that’s a warming of about 3 degrees Celsius from the current day. And in fact by the time we are removing fossil fuels at a high rate for the next 100 years, we will have depleted a fairly significant fraction of the fossil fuel. I don’t have the diagram here, but they’re loaded in the previous presentations. That’ll give you a sense of well, OK, this is higher than any of that, but as an absolute change it is comparable to what we had going in and out of the ice ages. So this kind of scenario is one of the reasons why there is a lot of research on the Pliocene, because they too had this kind of warmth in the northern high latitudes. And it could be the order of several meters, which would have a big impact on coastal development. That is, if you look at the planet Venus with its unusually warm climate–surface temperature for Venus is 460 in Celsius, 735 in Kelvin–it has the solar system’s strongest greenhouse effect, has a rather high albedo, it reflects a lot of sunlight. And so crops will grow generally more quickly. Reduce human populations, reduce per capita use of energy. A tree typically only lives 60 or 100 years and then it will die and that carbon dioxide will be returned."
479,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-2,"There are other ways in which we can perceive the existence of the atmosphere, predominantly through our perceptions of pressure. Not all planets have atmospheres, and the existence of an atmosphere depends on the ability of gas molecules to remain trapped close to a planet by its gravitational force. The molecular velocity of each gas molecule depends upon its molecular weight, and must exceed the escape velocity of the planet to leave the atmosphere.","We were talking last time about–well, we asked questions like, how do we know there’s an atmosphere? And it turns out that the key physics, the key process that determines this is whether molecules at the top of the atmosphere can escape the planet’s gravitational field. Little g is the surface gravity of the planet. And if I’ve got a molecule at the top that happens to be heading upwards, if it has a velocity less than this number (11,180 m/s), it’s going to go up for a while and then stop and then gravity’s going to bring it back into the atmosphere. Now, I think you know how to go back and forth between temperature units. Let’s say that the temperature–here’s my example. So this is a ranked list, my ranked list, of where I would expect to find atmospheres in the solar system. And right behind it comes Saturn for similar reasons. And let me continue the list a little bit longer. From observations, we think that these planets have atmospheres and these do not. Because remember, what I didn’t bring into here was the molecular weight of the gases. Mars may be OK but it’s a little cold for us. So this is the diagram I already really have on the blackboard. And the Great Red Spot, which I don’t think is shown there, is a giant vortex like a hurricane, but 1,000 times the size, sitting in Jupiter’s atmosphere, winds swirling around it. Whereas, the Jovian planets–that is, the planets that are like Jupiter in some way–are much larger, much lower density. Mars has a CO2 atmosphere but not much of it. A rugged surface, pockmarked with meteorite collision craters. Now, neither of these pictures of Venus is taken in visible light. You occasionally, I believe, see a cloud. We’ve had landers there, and from a number of other clues, we know that there’s a thin CO2 atmosphere on Mars. I’ll show you a list of some of these other important molecules in just a minute. The planets were all formed more or less from the same type of material, and so if you include everything all the way from the surface–top of the atmosphere to the center of the planet, there’s a remarkable similarity between the compositions of the different planets. They’re probably down in the interior parts of the planet. I won’t spend any more–some of these are important air pollutants in the earth’s atmosphere. We’re going to be–in a day or so, we’re going to be talking about the vertical temperature structure on Earth. Think about that profile, and in a day or two, I’m going to be asking you to speculate about why it is that the Earth’s atmosphere has this peculiar structure."
480,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-30,"Climate sensitivity is defined as either the temperature change resulting from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration or the temperature change resulting from a 1W/m2 increase in radiative forcing. There are several different climate sensitivities that take into account different feedbacks in the climate system. The simplest climate sensitivity is black body sensitivity, which does not account for any feedbacks but gives the temperature change resulting just from a change in radiative forcing. The calculated climate sensitivity based only on the Stefan-Boltzmann Law is lower than the climate sensitivity calculated using both temperature data over the last 100 years and ice age data over the last ~200,000 years, indicating that feedbacks have played a role in climate sensitivity. World population is also discussed, with population trends outlined for various countries as well as trends associated with developing areas versus developed areas. The issue of sustainable population is introduced.","Yeah, so this is a long list of things that one might do to reduce global warming. They would have to be very fine particles or they would just fall out. The theory of positive feedback–I’m going to be talking more about that in just a minute–the idea that there are these processes on earth that will tend to amplify climate change. The other one is, how much would the earth warm if you increased the radiation hitting the surface of the earth by one watt per square meter?Now these two things can be related, roughly, because a CO doubling–when you add CO to the atmosphere you increase the absorption and the re-emission of longwave radiation. Now the reason I like it, the reason I want to stick it in here, is that it’s being used more and more as a compact way to compare different models. Several in Europe, the Russians have one. And the reason why, as we will see–the reason why it’s fairly small is we have not included any of these positive feedbacks. Now this is a calculation you can do for yourself. It shows how much the radiation reaching the surface of the earth has changed and for what reason. And you get a value that’s about what CO would have been by itself. That doesn’t mean that CO is alone in importance. Well, here we have a temperature signature on the bottom and a CO signature on the top. But that would be slightly larger than 5 degrees if you went from minimum to maximum. So let’s look at the fertility rate for the United States and Canada since 1940. Maybe that movement caused this drop, or maybe it was just changes in background cultural or economic conditions. And now it’s come up a little bit for the United States to just about the replacement rate. So that’s the total fractional growth rate. And that would be that percent, or that fractional growth rate for population in China. That is what is meant by an exponential increase. So that might be an accurate representation. And there are very densely populated areas of California and so on. So just scanning this list and realizing that many of those have a relationship to population density would, I think, partly confirm Jared Diamond’s idea that living space is an important part of the success of a culture. So I think it could be argued that this might be a more efficient way to live. The first thing that happens is the death rate drops. We’ve seen this happen in country after country. So this is an important concept of how you go from one type of population situation to the other. A country that has a stable population usually has a population pyramid like this."
481,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-31,"There are two ozone problems in the atmosphere. Tropospheric ozone in the form of photochemical smog is sometimes dangerously high whereas stratospheric ozone concentration is sometimes dangerously low. Photochemical smog is created through chemical reactions between UV radiation from the run and nitrogen oxides that are emitted from automobiles. High concentrations of tropospheric ozone are dangerous because of the damage ozone can cause to a person’s airway if it is inhaled. The EPA has specified limits of ozone concentration but several counties in the USA exceed these limits. The primary air pollutants from which ozone is created have a peak concentration twice a day typically, which is associated with rush hour times during the day.","There’s two subjects left in the course now. So if you go on the EPA website, they’ve got a list of all the different air pollutants that they are concerned about, and this is roughly their list. I’ve combined a couple of things, but this is roughly their list. So that’s another side of that general success story. So a few things you have to know about ozone, it’s formula is O. It’s just like the oxygen that you’re breathing in. So as it vibrates, it can absorb and emit long-wave radiation. And so you see a little elevated ozone in the first kilometer or so of the atmosphere, and that’s the subject of one of the discussions today. Volatile means it likes to go into the gaseous state. And in that way, it’s almost synonymous with volatile organic compounds. And these have changed from time to time, but I believe these are the current values. Ozone is created in the atmosphere from other chemical emissions. So this is purely a concentration standard. There used to be one here in Connecticut. So that’s a part per million by volume, so that is a ratio of the number of molecules. The mixing ratio that I gave you on the last slide was 0.12 parts per million by volume, which can be written this way. So you still have the ratio of molecular weights. Indoor should be OK, because usually, ozone concentrations inside a building are not a problem. But we still have the carbon monoxide, but now, we’re getting ozone, PAN, which I’ll define in a minute, and that haze that you see when you look at the pictures of these polluted areas. So the two things kind of cancel to give you more similar behavior between winter and summer when it comes NO.And now we’ll do ozone, which is really the thing we’re most concerned about. What this diagram shows you is that you’ve got two different control strategies. But that, too, has dropped over time because of pollution controls on the primary pollutants."
482,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-32,"Stratospheric ozone is important as protection from harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. Ozone in the stratosphere blocks almost all UVC radiation, which is extremely energetic and harmful. Ozone within the ozone layer is destroyed through chemical reactions involving chlorine atoms and the ozone molecules. The main anthropogenic source of chlorine in the atmosphere is chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Emissions of CFCs began to increase after 1960 and continued to increase until the 1990s. The 1987 Montreal Protocol banned the emission of CFCs as of 1994, and currently CFC emissions are nearly zero.","We’re going to finish up the ozone thing by doing the stratospheric ozone. But it was long, like a four page article or something. And these are the new terminology you should be aware of. So we’ll talk about the ozone layer and then the ozone hole. And CFCs was the common chemical to do that. But now they’ve been replaced largely by HCFCs, the hydrochlorofluorocarbons. So it can be reused over and over again to make the same chemical cycle go forward. First of all, I showed this diagram last time as we discussed this part of the ozone issue, but now we’re going to talk about the ozone layer. And as it says here, contains 90% of the atmospheric ozone. So this has a very different vertical structure than the total pressure. So first of all, because it’s going to be a mixing ratio you need to know how much air is up there as well, not just how much ozone, but how much air. So I put everything where I said I would and I get a value of about 6,000 Pascals for the air pressure up here. Had to find out how much air was there and then from the proper ratio get it in the proper units. So if we were up there, that would be really tough for us to breathe that in. But the ozone concentration is quite large as well. And of course, you have to refresh the cabin air. So you’re going to have to compress it with some kind of a pump before you can put it into the cabin so people can breathe it. And that’s going to be a big compression. Let’s just think about this for a minute. So I’m going to assume that the, for this calculation, that the cabin altitude, what’s called the cabin altitude, is going to be kept at 2 kilometers. That’s a difference in 15 kilometers, so essentially you’re going to get 150 degrees Celsius warming when you compress that air about ready to put it into the cabin. Why would you want to fly at that high of an altitude?It turns out it has mostly to do with the efficiency of the engines. The reason they fly quite high, 35,000 feet, 37,000 feet is because the engines are most efficient at that altitude. But for historic reasons they didn’t do it that way. And that will tell you how much ozone there is in the column. And then you measure how thick that layer would be composed just of ozone and you measure that in thousandth of a centimeter. And I’ll be showing you this kind of data. Typical values for the earth’s atmosphere run from 100 to 500 Dobson units depending on where you are around the world. In the green you’re getting values maybe 325, maybe in some areas even 350 or 360. The reason why–part of the reason why there is that difference is because of a broad circulation that takes place in the stratosphere calls call the Brewer-Dobson circulation, which I won’t talk about, but this artist has reminded us that there is this broad slow circulation in the stratosphere. So why do we have ozone in the stratosphere? We know we have a lot of O in our atmosphere, it’s the second most common molecule. But then you’ve got some free oxygen atoms floating around. I’m curious if there is some sort of feedback mechanism or if the two slow reactions are interconnected in some way. And that will give a natural equilibrium eventually. And then you get this rapid recycling between oxygen atoms and ozone. And then occasionally, you’ll go back just to the O again. And the control of how much you have is primarily these processes, not this. This is just a rapid recycling of the two types of odd oxygen. UVA are the wavelengths closest to the visible, closest to the blue, defined as going from 400 to 315 nanometers. So UVA would cause tanning of your skin, but probably wouldn’t give you skin cancer, UVB might. This is altitude and Dobson units per kilometer to get where the ozone layer is. So about 1/2 or 2/3 of the UVB is absorbed by the ozone. And almost all, thankfully, of the UVC coming from the sun is absorbed by the ozone layer. So it’s a very good protective shield for us. It involves a catalytic reaction primarily using chlorine atoms. So you have a chlorine atom reacting with an ozone molecule. And you’ve got your Cl back ready to do it again. Questions on that?So up here in the inset is the emission. This is an example, CFC 11, one of the chlorofluorocarbons. So you see there was a rapid rise in it as it was being used in refrigeration. And when you put it into a refrigerator, it may be contained for a few years, but eventually it leaks out or someone tosses away the refrigerator and it gets a leak and it goes to the atmosphere. Thank goodness we’ve stopped putting it in, but it’s not going to decrease to 0 just because we’ve stopped putting it in. But then there’s this ozone hole that I’ll spend the rest of time talking about. And here’s what it looked like a couple of days ago. You can go to this website, which I’m just about to do. It first appeared in about 1978, apparently it wasn’t happening before then. The discovery of the depletion mechanism by Molina and Crutzen was a rather remarkable scientific discovery. I’ll give you hints of how that went in just a minute. What you do is set a threshold for ozone concentration. And the ozone hole was nonexistent before ‘79. But now it has reached about 25 million square kilometers, you saw a picture of it. So give me just a moment here to bring up this website. Yeah, let’s do an animation for this season. This is Antarctica sitting there waiting. You get this large area that forms with about half the ozone it would otherwise have. Ozone depletion is about 50 percent in that region compared to remember only 4% globally. The minimum ozone dropped to a minimum now it’s increasing now that we’re into November. And I guess what is the link to human activity? And then there’s the added impact of humans and somehow they have all come together to form this curious phenomena of the ozone hole. In the few minutes I have left I want to just try to explain some of that. And this is 65 South to 90 South, so this is the south polar region. These are at different altitudes, I believe, having trouble reading those. So of all the places in the world’s stratosphere, the Southern Hemisphere polar stratosphere, that is over Antarctica, has a winter time temperature colder than any other place on the planet. These are ice clouds that form up in the stratosphere. And they require an extraordinarily cold temperature in order to form, temperatures colder than minus 70 degrees Celsius, some would say even colder than that. Notice when it forms it’s storing HNO, nitric acid. So what you’ve done, you had your chlorine locked up in HCl and in this compound, there’s chlorines in both. When the light returns, remember, that minimum of temperature occurred in perpetual darkness. So you can get the ice forming, you can get the Cl all ready to go, but it’s in the diatomic form. And then go back a few slides to that catalytic reaction and it starts to destroy ozone. That’s why it occurs where it does and when it does because of that necessary condition for cold. So this is the storage form of the chlorine during most of the year in the stratosphere. Is there normally chlorine in the atmosphere besides the HCl? There were no CFCs in the atmosphere before that. There probably was a little bit of chlorine, but only a very small amount. Certain forms of substances have been added to the banned list, others have been allowed. It may have some other problems, it may be a greenhouse gas. But it doesn’t have the problem of putting permanently chlorine into the atmosphere the way that the CFCs do. Now one of the reasons why this treaty was signed, because as you’d expect the refrigerant industry vigorously opposed this, was at about the time it was signed, Dupont which was this large chemical company and the world’s largest producer of CFCs, discovered a replacement for it. So in the end, they dropped their opposition and many countries of the world got together and signed this international treaty. And that is because it’s believed there’s more mixing between the high and low latitudes."
483,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-33,"The various types of resources currently used for energy production are discussed. Energy is primarily used for heating, transportation, and generating electricity. Coal is burned largely to produce electricity and is a major contributor to air pollution with coal power plants emitting carbon dioxides and nitrous oxides. Another major resource used for energy is oil. It is projected that each country either has reached or will reach a peak oil use, after which oil use will decrease. Natural gas is now being obtained from shale using the extraction technique of fracting which is a recent discovery. Nuclear power gained popularity worldwide through the 1970s, however very few new power plants have been built in the last three decades following the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl episodes. Hydroelectric power is generated by forcing water flowing from high terrain through a turbine to produce electricity. There are many hydroelectric dams operating globally.","Well, we’re going to finish up the course by talking about energy. Hydroelectric comes from rain falling on high ground, so it has potential energy. The differential heating from the sun, as you know, can create the winds. But we can also dig up that uranium and use it in a nuclear power plant. It varies by a factor of two or three across the country however, so that’s not a fixed value. These are the ones that I put on the cartoon over there. And then when you burn it, you put the CO back. And I’ll run through some of it, but I won’t go through every detail. And that gives them a very high per capita use of electricity. This is coming from air that you’re using to oxidize the coal. Long trains full with boxcars with coal transport the coal from the mines to the power plant. Kilograms of carbon dioxide per gigaJoule of electrical energy produced. So North America has peaked and is going to be flat according to these projections. But this second technology is not developed yet. And so that’s just what we know about from the newspapers, right? The United States doesn’t have much left. So when you look at the timeline, this is similar to the ones I’ve shown you for coal and oil, except it’s for natural gas and just for the US. But at least the energy is there from the rain falling on high ground. And as I mentioned before, it can be either a dammed up lake, or there are these new run-of-the-river designs, where you don’t have to dam, you just take the water. You don’t have any way to store and use it during dry periods. Well, in Canada, for reasons we’ve already touched on, the maximum demand is in winter because of electrical heating. So the maximum natural river flow is in the spring and early summer from snow melt. In other words, they sell a lot of energy to us down here in New England, because a lot of our maximum demand is in summer for air conditioning. But on the scale of things, those are relatively small. Yeah, so let me just wrap up with this then. I pulled off this data from the DOE a few years ago, comparing three states–Connecticut, Ohio, and Oregon. So here, within the same country, within the US of A, because of the way these states are located in different provinces, you’ve got three completely different dominant electrical energy sources–hydroelectric, coal, and nuclear."
484,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-34,"Renewable energy sources are discussed. These include wind energy, solar energy, biomass energy and geothermal energy. Energy from wind is acquired through the use of large wind turbines. These turbines ideally need to be located in areas where there is strong wind and low atmospheric turbulence. Solar power is collected using both photovoltaic solar cells and concentrated solar power. Energy from biomass can be produced in two ways: burning biomass to generate electricity or fermentation to produce fuel ethanol. Geothermal energy is produced by pumping water below the earth’s surface into areas of hot rocks which heats the water and creates steam. This steam is then run through a turbine to produce power.","So last time we talked about the more conventional energy sources and the way they relate human activity to the environment. And in each case I’ve put for electricity or fuel. There weren’t enough questions last time. I’m going to derive for you something called the wind power density, how much kinetic energy is in the wind. Capacity factor is the actual energy you get from your wind turbine system divided by the maximum you could get if the wind blew strongly all the time. It has to do with the fact that the ocean is smoother, so the winds blow much stronger over the ocean than they do over continents. But they do have a local influence on the wind. So this is to remind you that first of all in the boundary layer, this thing we’ve been talking about throughout the course, the atmospheric boundary layer, the first few hundred meters of the atmosphere that feels the effect of the surface of the earth, there is wind shear. Although some people think they’re beautiful, others don’t. The units are in megawatts, it’s a power unit, so the average power. But this is the installed, so this is the capacity not the actual generation. And these are some of the proposals of where they might be putting several hundred wind turbines offshore. And the politics of that are complicated and the economics too. This is an artist’s, I think, figment, it’s not a true picture. That comes out to be 1/2 rho U cubed A (KE Flux=½ρUA). And that turns out to be in this case 600 watts per square meter. But the newer ones are going to be more like this example I’ve given you here. And if you put a turbine right there it’s not going to have the same winds that the first turbine had. So let’s take this example I’ve done here where the blade length was 50 meters. So it’s a thousand—it’s a kilometer each way. The things you have to consider to understand solar power are the solar constant, I’ve just put it on the board, the cloudiness, how much comes through and reaches the surface of the earth where your solar power system is located, and then the seasons, the latitude, and this all important solar zenith angle. And the last thing I’ll do, this is perfect timing, geothermal energy. Basically you have some hot rocks down below. You put water down into it, it gets heated, comes back up, you put it through a heat exchanger, you generate steam. So this is in units of milliwatts per square meter, heat conducting out of the earth, pretty small numbers. We didn’t worry too much about the heat being generated internal to the earth changing climate because these numbers are so small, they’re milliwatts. A good example of that would be a gas turbine, for example, run off natural gas or run off hydrogen."
485,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-35,"The material covered throughout the course is reviewed. Properties of air and water are discussed. Hydrostatic balance is discussed as related to the atmosphere, ocean and solid earth. Geostrophic balance is a force balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force, and applies to winds in the atmosphere as well as currents in the ocean. Several examples of equilibrium states are reviewed. Heat and mass are transported by fluid motion in the earth system through winds, ocean currents and rivers. Mixing, dilution and concentration is discussed as related to ocean and atmosphere pollutants as well as salinity in the ocean. Finally, symmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres is discussed, focusing on differences in land mass, Coriolis force and the seasons.","Well, we’ve learned about the atmosphere and the ocean, and how they work. And then logic, interpretation, and explanation. But that’s really important because this stuff is not meant to have sharp boundaries around it. And I’ve found that only deepening as I’ve studied it quantitatively. But we never see air in anything other than the gaseous state, so all we need are those three little things that I mentioned for air. Gas, liquid, and solid, that is to say, ice. We need to know the heat capacity of water. It’s not much of a difference, but it makes some difference. It explains why clouds form, for example. It’s the idea that when you go up–the way we derived it in an incremental form–is that if you go up in the atmosphere a height, delta z, move up from there to there, the pressure will decrease–keep the minus sign to remind me of that–at a rate that depends on the acceleration of gravity and the density of the fluid. But just remember, the density can be all over the place. And very often in the atmosphere and the ocean, after a few hours, you end up in a state of geostrophic balance, where the pressure gradient force balances that coriolis force. It says that the air or the water moves along the isobars rather than across. And so if I make a plot here of the outflow rate, versus the depth of water in the tank, it’s going to look something like this. So there is some curve like this, where, again, rate would be on this axis. Again, I’m not claiming that the earth’s ozone layer is in steady state, but that’s one possibility that we’d want to look at. If the density increased as you went down, that would be stable. In the atmosphere or the ocean it’s not confined in a pipe. The mass flow rate would be rho U a(mass flow rate=ρUA). And the northern hemisphere has its summer. Now, are there any other aspects of symmetry?"
486,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-3,"The Perfect Gas Law relates temperature, pressure, and density of gases in the atmosphere. It can be used to demonstrate why warm air rises, cool air sinks, and helium balloons float in the air. Buoyancy forces act in fluids (both water and air) when fluid is displaced by a parcel of a fluid with a different density. A combination of buoyancy force and the relationship given in the Ideal Gas Law govern the motion of parcels of gas in the atmosphere.","Last time, we talked about how planets retain their atmospheres. Now, there are some other fundamentals that involve electric field strength, magnetic field strength. That is the pressure unit called the Pascal. That’s the temperature, of course, in Kelvins. So the pressure you get depends only on the number of molecules that you have, not on the mass of those molecules. What we’ve done here is to–I think you can see it if you compare the two–basically we’ve said that the air density, the mass density is going to be–it’s going to be the number of moles per unit volume times the molecular weight. If you follow the math through, you can see that we’ve defined the specific gas constant as being the universal gas constant divided by the molecular weight. The average molecular weight for air is 29. So that’s the specific gas constant for air, which is the gas we have most abundantly, of course, in our atmosphere. For pressure, you should express it in Pascals. It seems like a trivial thing, but I’d like to prove that to you. The ball is less dense than the water, but I’m looking for a more detailed mechanism. The same amount of force as the weight of the displaced water? Because only in a gravity field will there be that increase in pressure as you go down. But it’s the weight, not the mass, so this has to be multiplied by little g, the acceleration of gravity. And my goal is to find out the buoyancy force acting on that parcel. The first assumption is we’re going to assume that the pressure in the parcel is equal to the pressure of the environment. When you mix two gasses together, what relationship do they have to each other?I can tell you pretty clearly what’s going to happen. Even if the masses are different, because they’re bouncing into each other frequently, thousands of times per second, the temperature of the A and B molecules will quickly come to the same value. Usually, we don’t need to know that, but occasionally, that’s the way we keep track of how much of these other gases you have. They’re found in varying proportions depending where you are. That varies only up and down by about 5%, plus or minus 5%. Wouldn’t the water temperature, the numbers there, 10 varies to 10 ? So these are variable ones, and these are constant proportions. But now I’m interested in how those numbers change with height. It is a measure of how fast the pressure and density decrease as you go up. So that also is about a quarter of what you started with."
487,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-4,"Pressure and density decrease exponentially with altitude in the atmosphere. This leads to buoyancy effects in the atmosphere when parcels of air are heated or cooled, or raised or lowered in the atmosphere. Temperature varies in a more complicated way with altitude in the atmosphere, with several inversions which occur at the boundaries of the various layers of the atmosphere. Solar radiation interacts differently with the gases that compose each layer of the atmosphere which affects which wavelengths of radiation are able to reach the surface of the Earth.","Now you may remember the other day when I derived how planets retain their atmospheres, I made a list of what planets and moons we expect to have atmospheres and which ones don’t. So that would just be this curve continuing up quite a bit further. A smaller value for scale height means pressure and density decrease more rapidly as you go up. For Earth, what temperature are you using? Now, while density and pressure have a pretty featureless, smooth decrease with altitude, temperature is very different. Right down at the surface of the Earth, there’s a bit of a diurnal–we use the word “diurnal” to indicate a day-to-night fluctuation. Tropos” comes from a Greek word meaning “turning.” In this case, it implies that that layer of the atmosphere is turning over quite a lot. And here the air does not turn over very much. Way out here, you have x-rays as part of that spectrum. Questions on this?So, to understand this, we need to understand the nature of the radiation coming from the sun. We’ll be coming back to this when we talk about the Earth’s energy budget, which we’ll do in just about a week. So that gives you some sense of vertical scale on this tropopause business, right? On Mount Everest, it’s going to be a near thing. You’ve heard the pilot come on, ladies and gentlemen, thanks for flying United Airlines. And so on this scale, that would be about that depth below. So let’s imagine that this is the surface of the Earth. There is evaporation providing water to the atmosphere, and our system is the atmosphere itself, and we’d like to understand something about the residence time of water vapor in the Earth’s atmosphere. And that is approximately 1 meter per year. Now let me do the same argument for water in the ocean. So that’s backwards from what we had before. For one thing, we could put an enclosure over a forest or over a farmer’s field and measure how fast oxygen is being released by the green plants. So I’m actually losing oxygen from the atmosphere every time I breathe. And notice where that comes into the calculation."
488,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-5,Several experiments are performed using a water tank with an input flow of water and an output flow. These experiments demonstrate the concepts of equilibrium and steady-state in system analysis and are analogous to various Earth systems; lakes and rivers and the overall heat budget of the planet. The greenhouse effect in the atmosphere is a mechanism for increasing the heat input from the sun in the overall heat budget of the Earth system.,"We’re going to be talking about a simple example of systems analysis. For example, the heat budget of the Earth, which we’ll be speaking about next week, you can store heat in the Earth’s solid parts and the atmosphere. I’ll explain why that’s important in just a moment. The input is this little rubber hose right here. Now, we have to do a little bit of calculation to protect against disaster here. We’re going to use—we’re going to assume a steady state, in which case Qin will equal Qout. We’re not going to want to put more water in there than that value. We’ll do a measurement, Patrick, on the new flow rate here. And we will square that and see what we get for our prediction for the water depth. In this case, the width does not influence the equilibrium states, but it does influence the rate at which you approach an equilibrium state. So let’s do a quick test to see if maybe the flow rate changed. Maybe it’s a low dam, maybe it’s just rocks in the stream, but the outflow is going to be controlled by the depth of the water, typically, in a lake. Now, the rain, which forms in clouds and falls to the Earth, probably the rain rate is going to be proportional roughly to how much water vapor you have. Then the temperature of the Earth is going to determine, though, how much radiates to space. Every time I change this input valve setting, we go through a transient stage and then approach to a new steady state. So you calculate the 66.53 for the maximum flow rate, is there a way to do that for the minimum—when it will bottom out? It’s the valve constant, 11.9, times the square root of six. The Earth will have to be hotter to maintain that balance. But that’s because I’ve gone slow on changing the inputs."
489,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-6,"A simple model of the overall Earth’s heat budget is derived. The Earth is assumed to be in equilibrium with the input of solar radiation balanced by the output of infrared radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface. Using this model, the Earth’s surface temperature is calculated to be cooler than in reality due to the lack of an atmosphere and the greenhouse effect in the model.","So last time, upstairs, we did this systems experiment where we had a tank of water. We talked about things like steady state balance, transient response to changes in the input and the output. Later on we’ll be dealing with the pole to equator temperature gradients. But for now, the Earth will have a single temperature today. If you have an object like anything in this room, or the Sun, or any object at all, and you plot the emitted radiation as a function of wavelengths–I’ll use the Greek letter lambda (λ) to represent wavelength. And this would be for a high temperature. When you make the temperature greater, of course, you’re increasing the amount of radiation that’s coming out at every wavelength. So the color, if you like, the color of the radiation changes as the temperature of the object changes. For the Sun, the surface of the Sun is approximately 6,000 Kelvin. And that is going to lie right about there, roughly in the middle of the visible range of the spectrum. That is somewhere–this is kind of a log scale I’ve got here. It’s 15 degrees Celsius–it’s like the temperature in this room. Maybe we’re a few degrees warmer than that, but this is a typical Earth-type temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law that says that the total power goes like the fourth power of the temperature. Then as I gradually increase the temperature, you can begin to see it there. That’s a different process than reflection. Anyway, that little gadget is a perfect illustration of the physical process I’m talking about. The radiation that’s missing there is going to be the radiation that hits the Earth. That shadow is just related to the projected area of this sphere, which is πr, the area of a circle. And because that heat then doesn’t really enter the Earth, doesn’t really add energy to the Earth, we’re going to drop that off. It’s not great, but it’s not a huge problem, the assumption of uniform temperature. So this prediction with the assumptions I made indicates the earth would be in a permanently frozen state. Now what do you think is the reason for the error? And then you get to the radio waves and it comes way down. The point is that most of the Sun’s radiation falls in a part of the spectrum for which the Earth’s atmosphere is transparent. The point is that these are at two different wavelengths. The albedo for these planets are 0.71, 0.33, and 0.17. We see that represented by that high albedo number there."
490,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-7,"The hydrostatic law describes the weight of a fluid overlying a given area, or the pressure at a particular point. It can be used to calculate the approximate atmospheric mass over a particular area, or to calculate the change in pressure over a given change in altitude. A calculation of the pressure difference from the ground to the twelfth floor of Klein Biology Tower is found to agree well with measurements taken at both locations. The hydrostatic law also applies to pressure changes with depth in the ocean.","So last time, we derived a formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet. And then we tried to consider how that system might come into a steady-state balance. So if I started the Earth at some temperature but I was–let’s say I started it at zero temperature, zero Kelvin. And from these considerations, we came up with that formula predicting the planet’s temperature, and we found that it was a little bit low. Today I want to do another one called hydrostatic balance. I drove up there as a historical gesture to Pascal. So of course, the atmosphere doesn’t have a definite top, but we’ll go up 10, 20 scale heights, and so we’re above virtually all the atmosphere. Think of it as a cylinder going up to space. And that’s about 10 metric tons, 10 tons per square meter. I just have to know the area of a sphere. I’ve put in 1,013, 9.81, like I did there. It ends with an m instead of a v.Well then, if you want to know the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, you’ve got the total amount here, just multiply that number times that number. And you want to know how the pressure is different at the bottom than the top. I usually use z in this course for altitude. So now there are three forces acting on this thing. Now, this is 12 floors, and I’m assuming that there’s about four meters from floor to floor. I know you did this in class also, but the mercury lies in here and up to there. If you play tennis at one of these inflatable tennis courts–you know what I’m talking about, they blow these things up?–you walk into that building, you have to kind of pull the door–high pressure inside, so you kind of have to push to get in there. But for the most part, you can measure the pressure inside a building, and it’s the same as it is outside. But it increases slowly, because rho is smaller. We’ll talk about this later on in the course."
491,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-8,"This lecture describes how pollutants mix in the atmosphere. Three cases are considered: confined mixing, unconfined mixing, and unconfined mixing with wind. In a confined volume, the concentration of pollutant in the air depends on the volume and the mass of the air present in the volume. Unconfined mixing is also known as diffusion, in which the pollutant disperses through the air from the source over time. When wind is considered, the pollutant disperses from the source in the direction of the wind. The change in temperature with height in the atmosphere is also discussed.","Well, today we’re going to talk about mixing and dilution. And I could be thinking about either small particles or gases added to the atmosphere. The mass of the air into which the pollutant has mixed is just the product of the air density and that volume. And that’s going to have units of kilograms. Or you could leave it as kilograms per kilogram, just to remind you what it is. And we’re going to define something called the dispersion coefficient, which will help us decide how fast that added material will diffuse or will disperse into the atmosphere. So the longer you wait, the larger that hemisphere will be, and of course, the more dilute will be the pollutant because you’ve put a fixed amount of pollutant in, unless you’re continuing to add it. So I’ve written here the formula for the air mass. Obviously, for longer times, that’s going to continue to grow and this concentration is going to get less and less and less. If I had a top-view of that same situation–here’s the top-view–there’s the power plant, there’s the source, the wind is from left to right. And if I was to slice this here or here and look at it along the direction of the wind, at any particular distance downstream, x, it would look like half a circle. So this is the key step, I’m going to equate the rate at which pollutant’s being added to the rate at which it’s being carried away by the wind. So the width of the plume will change with the wind speed, but not the concentration within the plume. So think a bit about how that would work. So if you live south of it, far enough away– That’s true. It is getting wider, fast at first, and then slower. I think I gave you a problem in which the source was quoted as a number of particles per second. For example, in an inversion–remember how I defined an inversion? An inversion was a layer where the temperature increases with height. And I’ve done that here in my little example. If I take an air parcel from this elevation and lift it, it’s going to cool. There is a new temperature of its environment. It’s a lapse rate where the temperature increases with height. This is a very stable environment where the parcel gets colder as you go up, the environment gets warmer. Now the situation that I didn’t do, and you can fill in your notes, do one last case where now–tilt this curve over so it’s flatter than the reference curves."
492,geology-and-geophysics,gg-140,lecture-9,"The lapse rate describes the rate at which air cools with altitude. Atmospheric stability depends on the lapse rate. When an air parcel is lifted or lowered, it can continue to rise or descend based on the temperature of the surrounding air at the new altitude, which indicates an unstable atmosphere. Inversions can occur in the atmosphere, meaning the air near the ground will be cooler than air aloft. This type of temperature profile can cause air to be trapped near the Earth’s surface in a boundary layer, which can also lead to pollutants being trapped near the ground.","Well, we were talking about mixing in the atmosphere. One was adding a material to a confined valley. It turns out that the temperature profile in the earth’s atmosphere plays a very important role in how material mixes into the atmosphere. And that arises because under certain circumstances, a parcel of polluted air will be able to rise and spread into a large volume aloft. So this is the diagram that I had on the board a little bit differently. But it’s good to call it the dry adiabatic lapse rate because inside a cloud, that takes on a different slope. So this is one when you’re outside a cloud, there’s no water vapor condensing. On Tuesday, maybe the temperature decreases aloft like that. You will have noticed that very often, wind decreases to calm at night. And then when we get to the evening again, the sunlight stops. So almost certainly, that parcel is going to find itself colder than its new environment. So inversions go together with air pollution episodes. I want to give you three examples of rather famous gas releases that kind of illustrate some of the physical principles I’m discussing today. In this case, the warm radioactive gases released from that plant did lift upwards into the atmosphere and then the wind carried it to great distances. And eventually, it will come to the same temperature as the environment. Eventually, gravitational settling will make that stuff fall back on to the ocean’s surface. And we’ll continue this subject next time as well. If they read the same, you know there’s no evaporation from the wet bulb, which means the humidity is 100%.If they read differently, that means the air is somewhat dry is able to evaporate water from the wetted wick. Any questions on these measures of water vapor?I’m kind of assuming that you know this already from a high school physics or chemistry class. So this is probably a little bit of a review here. But usually it’s used when we condense it to liquid. Freezing point for fresh water is zero degrees Celsius. If you have air that a sub-saturated, but you remove heat, you’re going to drop the temperature. You’re going to bring the amount of partial pressure water vapor together with the saturation partial pressure. What’s happening there is you have cold air moving across the ocean’s surface. So the ocean is evaporating its moisture into the atmosphere. And you start to form these little tufts of cloud or fog. So you’re burning hydrocarbons in the aircraft engine."
493,history,hist-116,lecture-10,"This lecture focuses on the best-selling pamphlet of the American Revolution: Thomas Paine’s , discussing Paine’s life and the events that led him to write his pamphlet. Published in January of 1776, it condemned monarchy as a bad form of government, and urged the colonies to declare independence and establish their own form of republican government. Its incendiary language and simple format made it popular throughout the colonies, helping to radicalize many Americans and pushing them to seriously consider the idea of declaring independence from Britain.","Today we are going to be discussing certainly one of the biggest bestsellers in early American history, and that’s Thomas Paine’s pamphlet Before I plunge in to I am going to answer the question that was asked from this section of the room on Tuesday, about how do you vote on voting — the little brain teaser of the Continental Congress. It’s one of the sad ironies of history that this person who — all through this lecture I’m going to be talking about the great influence of his pamphlet, had this great influence throughout the Revolution — and he actually died pretty much poor and not very much liked by Americans of all political stripes, more having to do with his politics later in his life than what he was doing during the Revolution, but he was not a happy camper in the years of his death. He disinterred the body; he went on a boat; he and dead-body Paine went sailing back to England. So, body of Paine sitting on his farm in England. I’ll talk a little bit about this today, but he wasn’t this sort of well-known and established writer. By doing that, the King basically gave some credence to the views of the more radical members of the Continental Congress, and radicals got even more credence on August 23, 1775, when the King issued a proclamation that declared the colonies to be in rebellion, and then made plans to send 20,000 British troops to the colonies, including Prussian mercenaries. So certainly things weren’t really feeling really optimistic at this moment in which things seemed to be dramatically shifting, and this is the setting in which Paine wrote In his mind, the time was right for some kind of a drastic change for the better in the American colonies and, as we’ll see, instead of just tinkering with the English constitution Paine basically turns his back on it, rejects King George III, rejects Parliament, and ultimately rejects even the idea of monarchy. He was someone who loved to assert his own importance. I think he was an excise man in England for a little while. In his spare time he liked to go to public lectures in London, and that’s where he met men like Benjamin Franklin. So Paine liked to hang out in this one local bookstore. And that is that when they seemed to strike at issues of American liberty, even indirectly, even seemingly through metaphor — as in one essay that talked about British domination of India but everybody assumed India must really be the North American colonies — whenever he was referencing any of that sort of thing, sales jumped. And it demonstrated the stupidity and utter uselessness not only of the English monarchy but just of monarchies generally. First, the Crown was the last remaining emotional and political link that was really tying the colonies to the mother country. And then third, I think equally important, rhetorically Paine had a really good writer’s sense of pacing, and he knew that if he opened this pamphlet with this really dramatic challenge to all of the prevailing assumptions about government, and if he turned all of these assumptions on their head, he would pull readers in to his pamphlet and in to his argument immediately and hold them there for the center of his argument, which was the second section of the pamphlet, and that is really the part that focuses on independence. He depicted government as a kind of necessary evil that was prone to create bureaucracies and privilege. And, as he put it — I’ll quote it again, but I think maybe it was the first lecture that I quoted this as my sort of random inspirational sentences from random guy from the eighteenth century. isn’t about exploring difficult constitutional questions. Okay, not in Jefferson does not sound like Thomas Paine. So this is what Adams  first had to say about Plato’s: “While wading through the whimsies, the puerilities, and unintelligible jargon of this work, I laid it down often to ask myself how it could have been that the world should have so long consented to give reputation to such nonsense as this.” Nothing else is now talked of, and I know not what can be done by Great Britain to prevent it. He said that regardless of whatever form he took in the afterlife, he would always know he had written Okay, but did cause independence? partly timing-wise, came out at just the moment where it was going to strike and have the broadest impact."
494,history,hist-116,lecture-11,"In this lecture, Professor Freeman discusses the Declaration of Independence and sets the document in its historical context. The Declaration was not the main focus of the Second Continental Congress, which was largely concerned with organizing the defensive war effort. The Congress had sent King George III the Olive Branch Petition in a last attempt at reconciliation in August 1775, but the King ignored the petition and declared the colonies to be in rebellion. Throughout the colonies, local communities began debating the issue of independence on their own, often at the instruction of their colonial legislatures, and these local declarations of independence contributed to the formal declaration of independence by the Continental Congress in July 1776. Professor Freeman concludes the lecture by describing the decision to have Thomas Jefferson draft the Declaration.","But now I will actually talk about the Declaration of Independence. Now as I suggested in last Thursday’s lecture, the Declaration of Independence came roughly six months after the publication of in 1776, but it was by no means the only or even the most important thing that the Congress had to do at that time, sort of not what we would expect given that it’s this iconic document. And before anything really major could be done, delegations either needed to confer on their own or, more often, I suppose, confer with people back home in their colony to determine what it was that their colony wanted them to do. Unfortunately, the petition reached the King at the same time as news of Bunker Hill, okay, one of those unfortunate strikes of fate. So August of 1775, George III declares the colonies in rebellion. One of the most important things about it is that because it swayed large groups of people — it wasn’t just a highfalutin’ political pamphlet written for the elite, but it really, as I mentioned already, was for the masses — that it enabled the Continental Congress to consider independence and ultimately to move toward independence as representatives of the popular will. And as she states in her book, these local declarations of independence get us as close as we can to the voice of the colonial public on the eve of independence. There was a logic to what went on in Rhode Island. They of course mentioned the Prohibitory Act, which declared the colonists out of British protection. They mentioned German mercenaries hired by George III to fight the colonists. On June 7, 1776, Virginia took a major step forward by making a resolution that it sent to its delegates in Philadelphia via Richard Henry Lee — he was one of the delegates — and the resolution from Virginia said that the delegates should promote independence because the colonies, quote, “are, and of right, ought to be, free and independent States.” Lack of agreement and the importance of the decision led Congress to postpone the decision until the first week of July so that individual colonies could decide on a course of action. Though a silent member in Congress, he was so prompt, frank, explicit, and decisive upon committees and in conversation, not even Samuel Adams was more so, that he soon seized upon my heart; and upon this occasion I gave him my vote, and did all in my power to procure the votes of others. Reason second — I am obnoxious,  poor John Adams. Regardless of the precise details as to whether there was or wasn’t a subcommittee, Jefferson did draft the Declaration. But also, ultimately Jefferson’s declaration as far as slavery is concerned had some tortured logic in it, because it first attacks the King for creating slavery, for transporting slaves to America, and then attacks him for offering them freedom if they fight for the British. Now, I think generally we and also often scholars tend to really focus on the preamble of the Declaration, but in fact at the time, it was the specific charges against the King that were considered to be the real meat of the document. Sometimes Congress made some of Jefferson’s charges more extreme, as when they added to Jefferson’s statement about foreign mercenaries words that described it — the act of sending them to the colonies — as, quote, “scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages.”"
495,history,hist-116,lecture-12,"Professor Freeman concludes the discussion of the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration was widely circulated and read aloud throughout the colonies. Professor Freeman argues that by 1775-1776, British and American citizens were operating under different assumptions about how the conflict between them could be resolved. The American colonists began to organize themselves for defensive measures against an aggressive British state. Meanwhile, the British assumed that the rebels were a minority group, and if they could suppress this radical minority through an impressive display of force, the rest of the colonists would submit to their governance again. Spring of 1775 saw the beginnings of military conflict between the British army and colonial militias, with fighting at Lexington, Concord, and Breed’s Hill. As a result, the colonists began to seriously consider the need for independence, and the Continental Congress began the process of organizing a war.","So today we are going to take the plunge  If you think about it, we didn’t quite get there yesterday so I do want us to declare independence for just a few minutes. Never write anything that a public body will edit because you will be very sad and all of your words will be sliced away. On July 2, 1776, Congress votes for independence. So first they’re thinking: possibly a European audience. The Congress sent it out to any number of places. particularly given that the Continental Congress, as we’ll discuss next week, didn’t have any absolute power to really enforce much of what it did, making it, as we’ll see, even more difficult for them to sort of organize and carry out a war effort?So basically, today and Tuesday I’m going to be talking about the process of opening a war and organizing a war, basically in the process showing something about the mindset on both sides. So what we’re talking about here is civil war. These soldiers have been there long enough that there’s just been mingling of soldiers and people, and so here the troops are marching and this person’s father is sort of going in to the crowd to see: If there’s someone here I know, I could ask him what’s happening; where — why are they coming here; what are their plans. “ At this point the British commander said that he would get over the bridge if he had to stay there until autumn. I will not be defeated,” to which the colonial captain basically replies and said, ‘Yeah, well, I think you already have been defeated because you’re here, and the weapons are there, and I don’t see you moving.’ So this to me is the most amazing part of the story. What we — we’re going to see here is one attempt to extend one more offer that maybe — maybe — at this last second will stave things off. And what we’ll see is what they’re underestimating. So what the British are underestimating here is that actually there is some unity; there is a sense of united cause because of an outside threat. Americans later claimed that what they said was, “You damn rebels, lay down your arms” — so Americans always hear the — if there is a slur the Americans hear it — at which point a gun was fired, and it’s unclear who fired the gun. There were a few American shots in return. And they actually met more militiamen on the way, and when they marched on them these people actually fled, which is in a sense what they were really expecting. It’s a temporary retreat on the parts of the colonists because, as a British officer later reported, as they left Concord after they’d destroyed these ammunitions, quote,“We were fired on from Houses and behind Trees, and before we had gone a half mile we were fired on from all sides, but mostly from the Rear, where People had hid themselves in houses till we had passed, and then fired; the Country was an amazing strong one, full of Hills, Woods, stone Walls… which the Rebels did not fail to take advantage of… . Where that came from I can’t tell you, but they’re out there sort of declaring their political cause. The Americans lost roughly four hundred men. They had actually sent more conservative delegates to the First Continental Congress. They hanged Lord North in effigy; they seized arms belonging to the city and distributed them to citizens; and ultimately the British marched out of New York City and retreated to a ship in the harbor with the colonists grabbing at their baggage and their ammunition as they left."
496,history,hist-116,lecture-13,"In this lecture, Professor Freeman discusses four difficulties that the Continental Congress faced in organizing the colonial war effort: regionalism, localism, the supply shortage that the Continental Army faced in providing for its troops, and the Continental Congress’s inexperience in organizing an army. The lecture concludes with a discussion of a Connecticut newspaper from July 1776.","So today, as you can see on the syllabus, the lecture is titled “Organizing a War” — and on this past Thursday, I talked about the opening phases of what basically — as I described it — is a civil war. Now the effort really began in earnest in May of 1775 when the Second Continental Congress was first sitting just after Lexington and Concord, because it was in May of 1775 that the Continental Congress took direction of colonial military resistance to the British by creating the Continental Army. And what Adams wrote was:“When 50 or 60 Men have a Constitution to form for a great Empire, at the same Time that they have a country of 1500 Miles extent to fortify, Millions to arm and train, a Naval Power to begin, an extensive Commerce to regulate, numerous Tribes of Indians to negotiate with, a standing Army of Twenty seven Thousand Men to raise pay, victual, and officer, I shall really pity those 50 or 60 men. I’m going to be looking at how the Continental Congress created and supplied the Continental Army, because in a lot of ways, when you look at all of the complications and controversies surrounding the creation of the Continental Army, you get a great case study of many of the problems that were at the heart of any effort at unity between the colonies and then the states. He was someone who seemed like he ought to be a military leader. He’s not campaigning, but he’s definitely putting the idea out there like: ‘I’m a military guy and you’re looking for one right now, and here I am in my uniform waiting  for you to notice me.’ He says he stood up to nominate Washington. If he went into a lady’s private chamber, apparently, he had six dogs — , that actually says something. State legislatures wanted to stay in control of their own militias. Hamilton, frustrated at headquarters, just seeing what he saw as this sort of amazing, potentially deadly inefficiency of the Continental Congress, really early in the war, he is already coming forward and saying, ‘We need a stronger centralized power; we need a stronger centralized power,’ even before anyone is really thinking about what kind of government comes later. So basically centralized coordination, scary thing for the states — not good news for organizing a continental army; neither was the complete lack of a precedent for what the Congress was doing in organizing this war — if you think about Great Britain, think about all of the sophisticated administrative machinery that they would have had there for conducting a war, and then think about the American states that have really nothing in place. Of the roughly sixty-five congressmen that were in attendance in 1775 and 1776, only five had served with the British during the French and Indian War; only one of these five had real experience in supplies and that experience dated back to 1759; none really had experience with medical matters in a time of war; only two had any medical training and they were not on the medical committee, so bureaucracy even at an early point. They sold sometimes their clothes and ammunition if they needed cash. When they were beating a hasty retreat, they tended to just throw anything that was heavy and getting in their way on the ground as they ran. He was given the task of training the American troops. He actually was much better in French and German, and so according to people at the time, when he was training the troops, he cursed in three different languages at the same time,  English, French and German, and I guess he cursed a lot. I think he was probably a little surprised by what the troops could not do. Supposedly, Steuben and others who were trying to train the troops discovered among other things that it was very hard to teach the people to march because they didn’t always consistently know left foot and right foot. Now von Steuben is one of the people who looked at the Continental soldiers and commented on what he took to be a particularly American attitude. It also created problems with terms of enlistment. Now this may sound logical by eighteenth-century terms — this kind of logic — but it often presented a problem, because sometimes there really wasn’t all that much separating socially — as far as rank is concerned — officers from non-officers. So dueling was a way for these young officers to sort of prove that they deserved to be elite. So basically I — I’m — I’ve handed this to you just so that you could get a sense of what a typical newspaper would have looked like — what you would have seen if you were in Hartford, Connecticut, on July 8, 1776."
497,history,hist-116,lecture-14,"In this lecture, Professor Freeman discusses Benedict Arnold as a case study of the ways in which ideas about regionalism, social rank, and gender–and the realities of the Continental Congress and the Continental Army–played out in this period. Like many Americans during this period, Benedict Arnold thought that he could improve his social rank and reputation in the military, but he was unable to advance due to the Continental Congress’s policy on military promotions. Frustrated and facing mounting personal debts, he decided to aid the British in exchange for a reward. Arnold and his wife Peggy developed a plan for Arnold to smuggle American military plans to the British with the help of a young British soldier named John André. However, André was captured while smuggling Arnold’s papers and the plot quickly unraveled. In the end, Arnold fled; his wife played upon conventional stereotypes of women to avoid punishment; and André was executed but idealized in the process.","We’ve gotten past the midterm, which is excellent. And then finally, at the very end of the lecture I mentioned that many people who would end up being strong nationalists in the 1780s and in the 1790s — people who were going to end up being at the forefront of the movement to strengthen the Articles of Confederation — many of these people gained their political beliefs and the need for some kind of a stronger centralized national government from their experiences during the Revolution, from their experiences with what often felt like what Alexander Hamilton called an imbecilic centralized government. Happily for you, it’s a lecture that will probably require you to take less notes than you typically take in lecture for this course, because what I’m going to do is kind of use a case study to look up close at just a handful of people and a series of events as a way of exploring some of the ideas that we’ve been talking about generally — ideas about the Congress, ideas about the army, and how they actually played out in a few individual lives. He was also a captain in the local New Haven militia and so he was really active drilling at the opening of the war. So this is someone who clearly is eager to fight. So, afraid of this, Congress debated and ultimately decided that officers should be appointed not just according to seniority, but almost more important, on the basis of balancing out the numbers of officers from different states. As one congressman wrote at the time, Arnold’s promotion was blocked because it raised, quote, “a question of monarchical or republican principles at a most crucial time.” So the honor of Parliament is involved in that issue, here the honor of the Continental Congress. They feel like that’s at issue and they can’t just back down because Arnold is being really persistent about what he wants. It was a grand social scene when the British were there. And this man, whose name was Joseph Stansbury, later described Arnold’s invitation. André thought that trade was a little bit disreputable so he decided that the army was a better way for him to advance himself, exercise his ambition, and achieve fame and glory, again not that unlike Arnold. Women were basically a nonentity in public life, they didn’t exist as public figures, so, as André explained in a note to the Arnolds, “The Lady  might write to me… This will come by a flag of truce, every messenger remaining ignorant of what they are charged with.” So 30,000 pounds sterling is a lot of money. Right?Peggy Arnold when informed in Philadelphia that Arnold had been promised a better command than West Point apparently burst into hysterics and then after regaining herself said she was sobbing because of the danger that this put her husband in. So that’s the excuse she comes up with, and we’re going to see her deploy this really successfully in just a few minutes at the sort of penultimate moment of crisis in this whole controversy. And here we get yet another example of how important it was for young men to gain status in the army — and actually young men of all kinds to gain status in the army — and how useful the army could be for promoting your own status and reputation, even for people who already had some social status — because in this case André’s commander in chief and friend, General Clinton, said the mission was too dangerous for his favorite right-hand man. He’s — Actually, he’s wearing plain clothes and he has papers from Arnold, so he’s thinking: ‘well, there’s not actually anything to link me with the British at this moment. What that meant was that he clearly was a gentleman who powdered his hair. Boy, Washington’s going to have fun when he arrives at West Point. They were actually eating breakfast with Benedict Arnold when letters began to arrive at headquarters. But interestingly, while he was in captivity, André became much more than a British spy to the American officers who were holding him prisoner, because during his captivity Washington and his aides spent a lot of time with him and came to consider him as the very model of what a gentleman and an officer should be. He was someone who was seduced by all that the British had to offer."
498,history,hist-116,lecture-15,"To show how Americans experienced the war and made difficult choices, Professor Freeman offers a spur-of-the-moment lecture on New Haven during the Revolution, discussing how Yale College students and New Haven townspeople gradually became caught up in the war. Warfare finally came to New Haven in July 1779 when the British army invaded the town. Professor Freeman draws on first-hand accounts to provide a narrative of the invasion of New Haven.","Now I want to turn to the lecture, and I’m going to start the lecture with my true confession of the day. I talked, I know, a little bit about mob actions and we’ve seen some in action. But basically I just came up with something that to me felt more interesting, more immediate, that’s going to show some of the same things I would have been talking about in my big, broad, general way with my leadership and citizenship lecture, but instead I’m actually going to base it on real people in a real place, sort of really showing you as the Revolution’s unfolding what happens to people in this place and how do events and ideas affect them. So really, in a main and a sort of major way what we’re going to be looking at is their story today, the story of average people in New Haven. Students are kind of above average because they would have been from more elevated families. Now, in the 1660s  we’re seeing these sort of public demonstrations — New Haven, Yale campus protesting policies — but not anything that dramatic happening. So they wanted official recognition from the Connecticut State Assembly. Things became more dramatic on April 21, 1775, when news of the Battle of Lexington arrived in New Haven. In New Haven, a Yale student wrote in his diary: “Today tidings of the Battle of Lexington, which is the first engagement with the British troops, arrived at New Haven. So the fighting stopped and eventually — I don’t know when — the Loyalist withdrew from Yale — so, you can’t blame him at this point. We have students ostracizing that one lone Loyalist student. Not long after this, Yale students organized their own military company and actually began training, and not long after that the New Haven town meeting voted, and here’s what they declared: Quote, “That the Governor be desired to permit one hundred stands of arms to be lodged in the library for the use of a company in Yale College … That should a company in college be formed and accoutred, they draw half a pound of powder to each man.” I cannot tell you why those particular places seemed like logical places, but you and your class were sent to a random place to continue your studies. In case this is actually true, they’re going to need some real soldiers, but he writes in his diary: “Would not believe the enemy intended landing.” That can’t be real; can’t be really happening. And in later years, he said he so enjoyed himself reading Blackstone during that period that he decided to become a lawyer right there and then. College was of course broken up and the students, with many of the inhabitants, prepared to flee on the morrow into the neighboring country. In common with others of the students, I was one of the number, and I well remember the surprise we felt the next morning (July 5) as we were marching over West Bridge towards the enemy, to see Dr. Daggett,” who is the former President of Yale, Naphtali Daggett, who is now a professor of divinity, so he’s a Yale professor,“how surprised we were the next morning, to see Dr. Daggett riding furiously by us on his old black mare with his long fowling piece in his hand ready for action. This was the last little skirmish and then the British entered. The student is kind of surprised he’s actually heading out with a gun, but again — the student knows tehat Daggett was thinking through what his actions were going to be, and then he watches him take action, like the Loyalists who left New Haven with the British; again a really dramatic action."
499,history,hist-116,lecture-16,"This lecture focuses on George Washington and the combined qualities that made him a key figure in Revolutionary America, arguing that the most crucial reason for his success as a national leader was that he proved repeatedly that he could be trusted with power - a vital quality in a nation fearful of the collapse of republican governance at the hands of a tyrant.","On to the topic of today’s lecture, and today’s lecture is: the importance of George Washington. He is a person and all that that entails. Now as I’m sure you’ve gathered by this time in the course, John Adams is a little jealous of other people who appear to be getting the glory, credit, and fame that he thinks he deserves, and not surprisingly he’s a little irked at Washington’s incredible sort of renown and status and fame and how beloved he is, as it developed between the Revolution and the 1790s. They’re really fascinating and really interesting and this is one of them. There was actually some truth to what he’s saying. So horse — being a good horseman was very valued and Washington — some called him “the finest horseman in the country” — so he was impressive as — I think I — Did I mention — I did mention last time at Mount Vernon when I saw him on that horse and said, “My, he’s impressive on the horse,” and then basically repeated what I’d read a thousand times in everyone else’s letters. He doesn’t necessarily always look ambitious, but he was ambitious. So Washington also, like many people in this era, is the right person with the right talents at the right time, but he has very specific talents that are really well suited to this moment in time. Now, I will say that any gentleman of the period would have been expected to display self-command or self-control as a sign of his superior character, and the ultimate example of that of course is dueling. A great example of it — It happens a number of times through the Revolution and I actually went off looking to see if I could find a very specific example — couldn’t find one that I had enough specific information on to offer, so I’m going to offer this other one, only because I have a quote associated with it, and it’s a story that always makes me happy. He had to be someone who could maintain his dignity and maintain his position, not just to command an army, but also to command the respect of the enemy. So clearly he’s an imposing figure and he had to be, but there’s an important point to make here, and that is, Washington combined that imposing demeanor with something that was equally if not more important for him to display as a leader in the new nation, and as particularly a military leader in the new nation, and that is that he had a modest demeanor. He was imposing, but he did not look like someone who was grasping for power. That kind of an army — It — Certainly, it has to be disciplined, but it can’t seem like this polished, professional fighting force because that moves off into the territory of: wait a minute. I beg they will accept my most cordial thanks for this distinguished testimony of their approbation. He wanted this position of being Commander-in-Chief of the Army. You heard him say that if some bad thing happens to my reputation — his reputation — He does truly fear that maybe he isn’t up to the task. He declared, when he accepted the mighty trust, that he would lay before us an exact account of his expenses, and not accept a shilling for pay. ”Or, as another Congressman put it, “Let our Youth look up to this man as a pattern to form themselves by; who unites the bravery of the soldier with the most consummate modesty and virtue.” It is not what people thought would happen at the end of the war. He will be the greatest man in the world. It’s not that he’s sort of pretending to be modest because he wants power. When they finally let go of the King, it makes sense, given everything that I’ve just said, that Washington is the logical person who fills that vacuum of the sort of symbolic leader who’s going to represent America, who’s going to be the sort of core symbolic leader of America. It was a really difficult balance, I think, for anyone to maintain and in many ways it’s why he really is the right man with the right skills in the right place at the right time."
500,history,hist-116,lecture-17,"In this lecture, Professor Freeman explains the logic behind American and British military strategy during the early phases of the Revolution. First, she discusses the logistic disadvantages of the British during the war: the difficulties shipping men and supplies from more than three thousand miles away; the vast expanse of countryside with no one central target to attack; difficulties in recruiting British soldiers to fight in America; and the fact that the British faced a citizen army comprised of highly motivated soldiers who didn’t act in predictable ways. In addition, the British consistently underestimated the revolutionaries in America, and overestimated Loyalist support. Professor Freeman also discusses the four main phases of the Revolutionary War, differentiated by shifts in British strategy. During the earliest phase of the war, the British thought that a show of military force would quickly lead to reconciliation with the colonists. During the second phase, the British resolved to seize a major city - New York - in the hope that isolating New England from the rest of the colonies would end hostilities. By 1777, the war had entered its third phase, and the British set their sights on seizing Philadelphia and defeating George Washington. This phase ended with the Battle of Saratoga in late 1777.","So on Tuesday, I talked about George Washington and some of the reasons why he proved so invaluable during and after the Revolution, and among other things I talked about the ways in which he proved time and again that he could be trusted with power. Well, today and on Tuesday we’re going to be looking at Washington in power, commanding the Continental Army, as we sketch out the chain of events on the battlefield that ultimately resulted in American military victory. As you will see — and I’ll come to that in a few minutes — I have basically divided the fighting of the Revolution into four phases — and I’ll explain in just a little bit why four phases, and what that means, and why they make sense, and then I’ll sort of proceed through them as we unfold what’s happening during the actual fighting of the war. That has a huge impact for a whole bunch of reasons, as I’ll talk about next week. And obviously, in the end, this is not a strategy that worked in the American states. The third bad assumption at the outset of the war is that the British Navy would accomplish most of the damage and largely win the war, because Britain did have this colossal, impressive navy. So as we’re about to see, all of these bad assumptions joined with all of those logistical things that I mentioned at the outset of the lecture, all of these together are not helping the British as the war unfolds, and they all play a role in the outcome of the war. And the British movements, the British troop movements, called forth an outpouring of American enthusiasm and enlistments and alarm, which was further bolstered by America’s victories — or I guess you could call them sort of semi-victories. Now, I have discussed a little bit the Battle of Bunker Hill, and you might remember that that’s the battle in which the British held the ground at the end of the day but at the cost of so many men — almost half of the men that were fighting there that day — that their victory didn’t really seem to be much of a victory at all — which is why you can sort of call it a semi-victory on both sides. We lost Ticonderoga and there’s a cannon looking down on us. So they stage this attack on Quebec to free it. This ends up being known as the Staten Island Peace Conference, and somehow this — I have no issue with Staten Island, but I just don’t expect that — all those words to go together, the “Staten Island Peace Conference,”  which is held September 11, 1776.At the conference, Howe tells the American commissioners — Benjamin Franklin, John Adams (making a little appearance), and South Carolinian Edward Rutledge, all of them there from the Continental Congress — that he would hate to be forced to destroy his brothers, the Americans. So the British descended on New York with an armada bearing 32,000 troops. It did not also necessarily strike fear into the hearts of the British at first. He retreats across New Jersey, retreats across the Delaware, goes into Pennsylvania. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. In less than three months, the British had captured New York City; they had captured part of New Jersey; food supplies and pay in the American army were at an all-time low; and, almost worst of all, enlistments of soldiers in the Continental Army ended at the end of the year. He uses the only thing that’s available to him at this moment — and that is his personal influence. Just — For me, for your commander, just give me six more weeks and then you can go. Largely, it consisted of the British attempting to subdue the middle colonies, once again proceeding under the assumption that if they get the right city it will cause things to end. which does not really make the Continental Army feel like they have much faith in them to protect them. There’s actually a really amusing letter. So here we have a battle where supplies are a major problem."
501,history,hist-116,lecture-18,"Today’s lecture concludes Professor Freeman’s discussion of the four phases of the Revolutionary War. America’s victory at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777 marked the end of the third phase of the war, and led to a turning point in the conflict: France’s decision to recognize American independence and enter into an alliance with the fledging nation. Although the British made one final attempt at reconciliation in 1778 with the Conciliatory Propositions, they were rejected by the Continental Congress. The fourth and final phase of the war lasted from 1779 to 1781, as the British Army focused its attention on the American South. The British seized Charleston and South Carolina, and defeated the Continental Army in a series of battles. But with the help of the French fleet, Washington was able to defeat Cornwallis’s army at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. Peace negotiations to end the Revolutionary War began in Paris in June of 1782.","So a quick review of what we covered on Thursday in the first of these two lectures in which I’m going to be talking about the war. And hopefully, as you hopefully remember, we began by talking about the British and the logic of their actions during the war. I think it’s really easy to look back on any historical event — but I think it’s particularly true for the American Revolution that leads to the American founding — it’s easy to look back and blame the loser for making dumb mistakes, but there were really logical reasons for what the British did during this campaign. Clinton and his men did not come to the rescue. And here are just one or two sentences from his testimony before Parliament. This was done and they bowed and spoke to each other. Not only did the French bring credibility to the American cause, but of course they also brought military supplies, and most important of all, as we’re going to see a little later in the lecture, they brought the French navy. But as a nation, the French were particularly eager to help the Americans because they assumed that after the war they might be able to take over much of the lucrative trade with America that the British had controlled before. We are now officially allied with America. I mentioned back when we talked about organizing a war, the Continental Congress was not very strong, couldn’t demand things from the states, could just ask, so supplies — organizing supplies was a problem. The army didn’t dissolve or mutiny at this point, which actually says something, but the experience of Valley Forge suggested to some of the men at Washington’s headquarters that there were problems with the weakness of the Continental Congress. And I’m going to come back to this lesson in future lectures when we begin to talk about the Articles of Confederation and the lead-up to the Constitutional Convention, because the experience of the Revolution taught some people, or led some people to believe that they had learned, some hard lessons about what wasn’t present — as what — during the war, as far as the government was concerned, and led them to believe something stronger needed to be there. I don’t know what they brought, but they brought refreshments. This did not please George Washington at all. But just then, August 30, 1781, a French fleet under French Admiral de Grasse arrived at the Virginia coast with troops and, as we’re about to see, this ends up being a really crucial turning point for what’s happening in Virginia and then ultimately for the war as a whole. People described, during the formal surrender on October 19, the slow passage of the British troops past the eyes of the American troops who were lined up in two columns that stretched for half a mile. Witnesses said that the British looked, quote, “unsoldierly,” and I think what that means is, according to another witness, “they were very much in liquor.” We are not to be surprised that the pride of the British officers is humbled on this occasion, as they have always entertained an exalted opinion of their own military prowess, and affected to view the Americans as a contemptible, undisciplined rabble. I was like: oh, cool, letters between the French and the British during Yorktown. It’s not until June of 1782 that negotiations began in Paris. They agreed to evacuate all royal troops from American soil. John Adams, thinking of New England, got American fishing rights off of the Grand Banks of Canada; Canada appears again."
502,history,hist-116,lecture-19,"In this lecture, Professor Freeman discusses the experiences of African Americans, women, and Native Americans during the Revolution, framing her discussion within a larger historical debate over whether or not the Revolution was “radical.” Freeman ultimately concludes that while white American males improved their position in society as a result of the Revolution, women, African Americans, and Native Americans did not benefit in the same ways.","I now actually want to move on to the topic of the real lecture today, and I’ve titled the lecture “War and Society.” So today we’re going to be talking about society; what kind of society was America going to have in this experimental, brand new nation? Look at what they were doing over there in France. Now certainly the period of conflict, of actual fighting during the Revolution, really stirred things up in the realm of slavery in a number of ways. So specifically, on November 7, 1775, the colonial governor of Virginia who, as I just mentioned, was loyal to the Crown — his name was Lord Dunmore — he passed a proclamation calling on slaves who belonged to rebellious planters, and stating that any of these slaves who were willing to bear arms in the service of the Crown should flee their masters and come to the British encampment at Norfolk and fight for the British. So you have white Loyalists being given grants of hundreds of acres of land; you have black Loyalists being given sometimes as little as one acre of land, sometimes as much as fifty acres of land, nowhere near sort of parity, nothing equal going on here. Now of course, slaves did not just serve in the British Army, or only ally themselves with the British. So we’ve seen in a variety of ways here that the war shook up the system of slavery in several ways. Boycotting British goods is an act of — It’s a political act ,and women are often the people who are purchasing goods — that the need to spin and weave homespun cloth, because British manufactured goods are being boycotted — again, that’s a really political act. So some of the daily actions of women became politicized during the Revolution. Believe it or not,  for a little window of time in New Jersey, women had the vote during this time period, in direct consequence of the principles of the Revolution. There was a lot of attention being paid to female education. You see it in public discussions at the time. So we’ve seen some ways in which the Revolution affected women. So even as the Revolution is going on, Americans are acknowledging that they’re — they feel threatened by Native Americans, they understand that there’s a link somehow between British and Native Americans, and they’re waging attacks there as well as everywhere else. Now this wasn’t true for all Native Americans, nor did all of them assume that their only option was war. But I have a senior essay writer who is writing his essay on the fact that there’s a little, tiny window — we’re talking about a lot of little, tiny windows — a little, tiny window at the beginning of the new government under the Constitution, and there was a brief period in which the national government thought well, maybe we can actually have sincere diplomacy with the Native Americans; we can sort of treat them like a foreign nation and do something that will maybe waylay problems. It’s not a window that lasts very long, and when that window is over, there is more nasty warfare, but that’s what this senior essay is about, that little window that this essay argues is often not recognized because people look to sort of Jackson wiping out Native Americans, and they just transpose that back across time, and they don’t really acknowledge that this little bit of diplomacy here was serious. And I think taking the long view of American history, I think that’s a more realistic way to think about how things change over time, than to assume that everything always gets better. I think these three populations show that really dramatically."
503,history,hist-116,lecture-1,"Professor Freeman offers an introduction to the course, summarizing the readings and discussing the course’s main goals. She also offers five tips for studying the Revolution: 1) Avoid thinking about the Revolution as a story about facts and dates; 2) Remember that words we take for granted today, like “democracy,” had very different meanings; 3) Think of the “Founders” as real people rather than mythic historic figures; 4) Remember that the “Founders” aren’t the only people who count in the Revolution; 5) Remember the importance of historical contingency: that anything could have happened during the Revolution.","Now, I’m looking out at all of these faces and I’m assuming that many of you have probably arrived here with some preconceived notions about the American Revolution. The last name is C-a-p-p-o-n if you’re interested. Well, in part, they are expressing part of what this class is going to be exploring. So this scattered group of independent colonists gradually came together to form one united nation, not the goal but the outcome. You can actually also assume why a lot of people might not even have liked it as an idea, and you can even see why after the Constitution goes into effect and the government is getting under way, even then people were really just not sure this thing was going to work. And it’s amazing when you look at letters from the 1790s you’ll see these little throwaway comments like “If this government lasts more than five years, here’s what I think we should do.” Aaah, the story of the American Revolution; I love the story of the American Revolution. So that’s — Tip number one is don’t get lost in the dreaded Revolutionary War fact bubble, which I have to say it makes me think of the first time that I taught this course. Every once in a while as a professor you say something and then you think with horror about how it’s going to look in your notes. Our real disease is democracy, Alexander Hamilton. Now admittedly, Hamilton might not be the shining example of the point I’m trying to make here because he’s not exactly Mr. Democracy so you wouldn’t really expect him to be clapping his hands for it. We’re talking about the most basic things about America — right? — How did rebelling against their own country make sense?And that’s something I think we also tend to forget about the Revolution. When I was preparing this lecture, casting around, trying to figure out what will I put in the lecture, I don’t know how I came across it but I discovered the Battle of New Haven. That’s the entire founding I think in our minds sort of. He’s even self-deprecating sometimes, which — Nobody wants to be self-deprecating on paper when they know that they’re going to be a Founder, but John Adams sometimes is, and I’m going to offer one little, tiny dumb example, the first thing that popped in to my mind when I thought, ‘well, what am I going to say to show John Adams’ sense of humor?’So this is actually from that same series of letters in their old age when they’re writing back and forth to each other. Partly I’m curious about this and partly I want to mention something. We assume that the colonists were right and that the British were wrong. Of course we need to declare independence. They actually are dramatic; they’re feeling that this is a dramatic kind of a moment, and I don’t think you get that sense, I don’t think you get that idea unless you remind yourself about contingency, about the fact that there are no predetermined outcomes and that anything can happen."
504,history,hist-116,lecture-20,"This lecture discusses the ongoing political experimentation involved in creating new constitutions for the new American states. Having declared independence from Great Britain, Americans had to determine what kind of government best suited their individual states as well as the nation at large; to many, this was the “whole object” of their revolutionary turmoil. Different people had different ideas about what kind of republican government would work best for their state. Should there be a unicameral or a bicameral legislature? How should political representation be organized and effected? How far should the principle of popular sovereignty be taken?","So today I’ve titled the lecture for today “Confederation,” but in a sense I’m going to be talking about something larger than that, and by the end of the lecture I’ll be talking about the Articles of Confederation. I’ll talk a little bit more about them on Thursday. And we dealt with one of them on Thursday and that was the question of what would happen to American society, and I looked at that in a very specific way but I was touching on that broader question, which is: okay, so we’ve had a Revolution; what does that do? That was the period in which government was doing all of those things. People didn’t know what was going to happen. But I want to start with state constitutions — and the fact is, although to us we think “constitution” is sort of the big, looming thing that’s important in that period, to people at the time, certainly in the middle of the Revolution, it was really in the drafting of state constitutions that they really thought the future of the American people was going to be decided. ’So as early as the beginning of 1776, states began considering what they should do about the unsettled state of governance in their own colonies. And just as the conservatives in Congress argued, certainly to John Adams and many others, that resolution was what really was the instrument of American independence. That’s amazing and I have some ideas about that. So Adams — so many people asked him, that he wrote up what he called a sketch of what a new constitution might look like. And he gave the sketch out to a few people. ‘ Obviously, America did not have Lords and Commons in quite the same way, but the idea remained. And one example of this is from 1790 — so one year of government — and the Senate wrote some kind of a bill, and they included I suppose names of people who had drafted the bill, and before the names of the people they put “the honorable,” like “the honorable messieurs,” and they sent this to the House. One dramatic way in which you could really see the sovereignty of the people being emphasized in these new state constitutions is through the way in which they curbed executive power. Imagine how many laws would actually pass if this is the case. We sort of don’t think of what that phrase means, but it was meant really literally. Now if, as the founding generation assumed, absolute power corrupts absolutely, then the Articles of Confederation was a very virtuous form of government because under the Articles, the Confederation Congress had almost no power to enforce its will at all. It could fix standards for weights and measures. It could borrow money although it couldn’t really tax. Those are the restrictions on the states. The states basically all turn their back on each other and say, ‘Well, that was nice. So that’s actually — And we’re going to see that particularly in the 1780s and then the 1790s."
505,history,hist-116,lecture-21,"In this lecture, Professor Freeman discusses the Articles of Confederation. Although they seem hopelessly weak in the long view of history, the Articles made perfect sense as a first stab at a national government by a people who deeply distrusted centralized power - a direct product of their recent experience of the British monarchy. Among the many issues that complicated the drafting of the Articles, three central issues included: how war debts to European nations would be divided among the states; whether western territories should be sold by the national government to pay for those debts; and how large and small states would compromise on representation. When a series of events - like Shays’ Rebellion - highlighted the weaknesses of the Articles, some Americans felt ready to consider a stronger national government.","Today’s lecture basically is titled “A Union Without Power.” In a way, you could say that that entire lecture was about the states, even though it was about — really talking about a way to unify them. And as an introduction to that, I want to talk for just a few minutes about some of the actual debates in Congress about the Articles themselves — some of the things that gave people in Congress pause when the Articles were being written — because, as you’ll see, this reveals a lot about the mindset of the time regarding centralized power and state power. So just a few minutes about the debate over the Articles. So this is just a random comment, but it’s from Edward Rutledge of South Carolina, and it’s a private letter that he wrote to a friend — and he was actually on the Congressional committee that was given the task of writing — coming up with something that would be ultimately the Articles of Confederation. These three things all helped to slow down and complicate debate over the Articles, so that even though they start talking about the Articles in 1776, there’s a reason why it takes all the way until November of 1777 for Congress to decide that they’re done with them. Because all we’re going to see in this lecture is one after another after another instance of this government not working so well. Now even before some of the problems of the 1780s began to unfold, there were already people who felt that the Continental Congress had been frustratingly inadequate — and we heard about some of these a couple of weeks back — and not surprisingly, people who had been angry about the Continental Congress are now irritated with the Confederation Congress too. And obviously I’m just naming a few random instances here. There are many other people who felt this way. And you can hear the impact of these kinds of developments in a letter that Washington wrote to a friend, and this is as early as 1784:“The disinclination of the individual States to yield competent powers to Congress for the Foederal Government, their unreasonable jealousy of that body & of one another — & the disposition which seems to pervade each, of being all-wise & all-powerful within itself, will, if there is not a change in the system, be our downfal  as a nation. — “This is as clear to me as the A, B, C; & I think we have opposed Great Britain, & have arrived at the present state of peace & independency, to very little purpose, if we cannot conquer our own prejudices. Centralized issues that affected other states very often seemed to people to be of secondary importance to concerns in their own state. And this persisted throughout the entire 1780s, this weird limbo for the people of Vermont, nobody really quite deciding what was going on. Then we are now the independent state of Franklin. We’re not — You’re not getting the land.’ ’End of controversy, you would think, but of course no. So many of the wealthiest merchants in Massachusetts, and some of these lawyers, raised their own money and created their own private army to suppress the rebellion of several thousand men. He went to the independent republic of Vermont. One of them ends up becoming known as the Newburgh Conspiracy because it takes place in Newburgh, New York. George Washington, a little George Washington moment. This is really the theme of the nationalists who took the lead in moving the nation towards the Constitutional Convention. That was news to me, and the fact that this particular one guy who — student who estimates how many troops were there — Stiles calls him “a young gentleman of solidity and good information” — he’s the guy who I guess did counting and estimating. Not everybody thinks that this is the sign of a horrible, horrendous crisis but, boy, the people who really felt that the Articles was a problematic government were very loud, and over time they become very united in thinking that there’s a serious problem about the center of government in the new nation."
506,history,hist-116,lecture-22,"In this lecture, Professor Freeman discusses how the new nation moved towards creating a stronger, more centralized national government than the Articles of Confederation. Complications of commerce between individual states - a factor that wasn’t regulated by the Articles - led to a series of interstate gatherings, like the Mount Vernon Conference of March 1785. Some strong nationalists saw these meetings as an ideal opportunity to push towards revising the Articles of Confederation. Professor Freeman ends with a discussion of James Madison’s preparations for the Federal Convention, and the importance of his notes in understanding the process by which delegates drafted a new Constitution.","We’re moving towards the Constitution; it’s kind of amazing, kind of weird. Now just a quick review before we plunge down the road. Now these men saw a host of problems with the Articles of Confederation. And for years and years and years these people kept calling for some kind of a national convention to reform the government. They didn’t leap into a new stronger government. Commerce is going to make or break individual states and make or break the new nation. So it doesn’t seem necessarily like a really big deal. Unfortunately, Virginia Governor Patrick Henry somehow or other managed to fumble something, so he basically didn’t tell the four Virginia delegates when the meeting was happening and where the meeting was happening. It took place on March 25, 1785, and continued for three days. That led into a decision to maybe meet regularly and talk about this more broadly. Both men certainly would have done their best to usher the agreement through the Virginia legislature. So ultimately there is a decision to hold a meeting about American trade, a meeting that supposedly is going to include all of the states. It’s opening things up so that it’s going to get more centralized. Even Maryland, the host state, did not send delegates to the Annapolis Convention — okay; that’s a real snub — out of fear that it transcended the power of the Confederation Congress. But I want to have a little moment for him here, because, as you’re going to see throughout the rest of this lecture and also on Thursday, he does a number of really interesting things and ultimately some really important things in 1786 and 1787, all of them in one way or another bound up with strengthening the government. So he’s reading through book after book after book. So eight states are like: ‘yeah, okay, we could get behind a conference to reconsider the government.’ So scholarly project number two: He decides that now — just like before he was looking for virtues and vices of confederacies over time — now he’s going to look at vices in the American confederacy, and he actually titles this document “Vices of the Political System of the U. States,” or the United States. So he’s making a list of all these vices and some of them, again, ultimately end up being talked about in the essays that he contributes to the .So Madison basically has this long-term study project in preparation for what comes to be known as the Constitutional Convention. And again, this was like his project of the Constitutional Convention. Okay, which I thought was a rule, but like, ‘ha, ha, sure, armed guard, okay, high security’ — but lo and behold, when I wanted to get some of George Mason’s notes to put in the exhibit, there was a guy with a gun walking next to me. I will talk about the plan and the Constitution on Thursday."
507,history,hist-116,lecture-23,"Professor Freeman discusses the debate over the Constitution at the Federal Convention of 1787 - a convention that by no means had an inevitable outcome. Indeed, even attending the Convention at all was a subject of debate in the individual states; many people feared that the Convention would produce a pseudo-monarchical form of government that would abandon the true significance of the Revolution. Ostensibly called to revise the Articles of Confederation, the meeting ultimately produced an entirely new form of government, in part, thanks to the influence of James Madison’s “Virginia Plan” of government. Professor Freeman focuses on three subjects of debate among the many that occupied the Convention: the debates over representation, slavery, and the nature of the executive branch.","Before we begin, I have to make a true confession to you, my class, because you’re my class, and I have been confessing things all semester but this is — I basically set myself up for this failure and then realized — at the end of the class someone came up to me and asked me a question, and then I realized — Gaa! So basically, what we saw on Tuesday was how the Americans were basically backing their way into what would become the Constitutional Convention. And what I’m talking about here, what I will be talking about over the course of this lecture, it’s a similar process of debate in which people throughout the country were really trying to figure something out. Now I think in the same way that we have all these “of courses” — of course we know what’s going to happen, it’s the Constitution — I think it’s also easy for us to walk down the “of course” trail when we think about nationalists like James Madison or Alexander Hamilton. In some way or another, some people feared that strengthening the national government was a kind of counterattack against everything that the Revolution had meant. And the fourth representative, named Abraham Granger, was particularly straightforward. He actually thought that this Convention was a bad idea, and he stated specifically, the reason why he didn’t like the whole idea of a Convention was probably it would end up creating a monarchy, and then we’d be right back to where we were before. They all argued, as you would expect them to argue, that the well-being of the Union and the well-being of the state of Connecticut really, really required a stronger central government. So clearly, so serious that one state is just not there. A good number of them had experience serving in either the Continental Congresses or the Confederation Congress. They’re not entirely sure what’s going to happen. Again he’s another man in this period that — an American who had an international reputation. The first would be a bicameral legislature. The lower house would be elected by the people. The legislature would have the power to nullify any state law contrary to the Constitution, and representation — as I mentioned — in the lower house is based on population. Now that’s a pretty major thing to decide. So for example, the Confederation decided that the executive would be one man after debating this for a while — and I’ll talk a little bit more about this toward the end of the lecture — but they ultimately decided that one man should be the executive, and clearly, in a world where you’re scared of centralized power and thinking about kings, that’s a big decision. Now the question is: why did he stand up and give that speech? And I always feel — I don’t which of these is true or not true. This is not a battle that stops once this decision is made. And ultimately a committee came up with a solution, which is known either as the Great Compromise or the Connecticut Compromise, and the reason why it’s the Connecticut Compromise is because it was proposed by Connecticut delegate Roger Sherman. If a state wanted to have their legislature pick electors, they could. But in the interest of time: on September 16, 1787, the Constitution was agreed upon."
508,history,hist-116,lecture-24,"Professor Freeman discusses the national debate over the proposed Constitution, arguing that in many ways, when Americans debated its ratification, they were debating the consequences and meaning of the Revolution. Some feared that a stronger, more centralized government would trample on the rights and liberties that had been won through warfare, pushing the new nation back into tyranny, monarchy, or aristocracy. The Federalist essays represented one particularly ambitious attempt to quash Anti-Federalist criticism of the Constitution. In the end, the Anti-Federalists did have one significant victory, securing a Bill of Rights to be added after the new Constitution had been ratified by the states.","On Thursday, I gave the world’s most condensed lecture about the Constitution, and I mentioned three controversies that represented long-standing concerns in Revolutionary America: the question of representation, the problem of slavery, and then the question of a national executive — so that really boils down to the problem of investing power in one man. I did not have time to discuss one last issue, which I do want to talk about here before I go into the real topic of today’s lecture. that the living should be controlling things; the dead hand of the past should not have weight in the present. Madison’s a tactful guy, and he’s tactful in his response, but when you look beneath the surface of Madison’s reply, I always feel like what you see there is this sustained howl of disbelief, like: ‘What!? So that’s certainly one compromise that Madison is not willing to sign on to, but of course the compromises don’t end with the closing of the Federal Convention. So all of this is sort of looming out there. If the Constitution made it to the states for ratification, if the states agreed to consider it, then they had to worry about the actual debate over whether this Constitution was a just, trustworthy division of power. I don’t know what they’re doing, but Yale students, debate amongst yourselves. States are the characteristics and the soul of a confederation. For one thing, like everyone else, they are concerned with the placement of power. I guess in their mind maybe it hadn’t been won yet because it depends on what happens with this government. You could sort of draw a line and understand where these fears come from. Patrick Henry, who is always useful for wonderful quotes, in the Virginia Convention says that by giving so much power to a new national government, quote, “the tyranny of Philadelphia  may be like the tyranny of George III.” You can’t draw a more direct link than that. Federal — federal — states are still important — the subtext of the calming component of the essaysA federal government would energize the government without prostrating the states or trampling on the American people; that’s the compromise of federalism. But the problem is, some Federalists did have problems with this idea of a bill of rights. Here Ezra Stiles helps us out one more time because he put in his diary every time he heard that a state had ratified the Constitution. Now that’s kind of interesting, actually. That’s kind of a radical thing for him to ask the students to debate. the President … ought to be visited with an independt Power of Commandg the American Army?”If you’re curious about what other things Stiles has people debating in addition to random constitutional issues, I just have a little sampling here to give you a sense of what it would have been like to be a senior at Yale College in 1788 and 1789. Given that this was a national debate, what does it show us about the state of the nation at the time? Americans also could generally agree that this was an experiment in government; that it was something unique; that they were experimenting in the possibility of having people sit down and deliberately create a just government grounded on the rights and will of the populace."
509,history,hist-116,lecture-25,"Professor Freeman discusses when we can consider a revolution to have ended, arguing that a revolution is finally complete when a new political regime gains general acceptance throughout society - and that, for this reason, it is the American citizenry who truly decided the fate and trajectory of the American Revolution. Yet, in deciding the meaning of the Revolution, the evolving popular memory of its meaning counts as well. Founders like Thomas Jefferson and John Adams frequently told younger Americans not to revere the Revolution and its leaders as demigods, insisting that future generations were just as capable, if not more so, of continuing and improving America’s experiment in government. Professor Freeman concludes the lecture by suggesting that the ultimate lesson of the American Revolution is that America’s experiment in government was supposed to be an ongoing process; that the Revolution taught Americans that their political opinions and actions mattered a great deal - and that they still do.","So this is my last true confession to you, my class, and it’s a true — I always give you true confessions. So I’m trying for symmetry — course symmetry. Some of them were none too pleased about what they saw as this sort of widespread social instability. So in essence, these people are seeing that there might be a big change happening, they don’t know what the change is going to be, and anything seems possible, and all of those things obviously would represent going back on what the Revolution had just gone forth for. Maclay says, “The whole world is a shell, and we tread on hollow ground every step.” Now this change of principles wasn’t easy, and actually I think it was the whole intensity of the experience of that 1800 election that led Jefferson to experience and describe his election as a revolution that was fought and won. And I’ll mention here only because it’s been a continuing theme in our course: we’ve seen lots of crying guys over the semester. Now that’s really interesting, because here you see Hughes — He’s defending his fellow Bostonians literally and physically, and he’s clearly — I suppose in insisting that he has a right to hold on to that cane — defending his rights too. But what you see is that he’s taken action almost instinctively. So clearly, his sense of involvement in unfolding events is growing, particularly given that he next took part in the Boston Tea Party. For one thing, his recollections offer a great example of the ways in which the Revolution inspired average Americans to become politically active. So in essence, he helps us see how the Revolution could politicize someone. And eventually, the American people would not show that kind of fear and trembling before a member of the supposed elite, so basically, eventually the American public would find their voice. Now, he’s talking about the elite, but you could expand this to include the American citizenry as well, because in a variety of ways the Revolution shook things up, and in doing so it expanded people’s horizons. And all this to answer letters into which neither interest nor inclination on my part enters; and often from persons whose names I have never before heard.” And then at one point in this letter  I just thought — that’s so weirdly modern. Strangers made pilgrimages to Monticello. So, I think it wasn’t fun being a Founder basically. And he said, “I could not see their hearts, … but, as far as I could penetrate the intricate foldings of their Souls, I then believed, and have not since altered my Opinion, that there were several who signed with regret, and several others, with many doubts and much lukewarmness.” We didn’t always entirely believe what we were doing. They’re not from the Adams I was just referring to a few minutes ago, which is the I-don’t-get-any-respect John Adams, and he’s there too. It’s so hard when you teach courses on the Founding period because everything you say has weird resonance in the present — as I’m kind of saying here — and I don’t want to have weird resonance in the present ."
510,history,hist-116,lecture-2,"Professor Freeman discusses what it meant to be a British colonist in America in the eighteenth century. She explains how American colonists had deep bonds of tradition and culture with Great Britain. She argues that, as British colonists with a strong sense of their British liberties, settlers in America valued their liberties above all else. She also explains that many Americans had a sense of inferiority when they compared their colonial lifestyles to the sophistication of Europe. Professor Freeman discusses the social order in America during the eighteenth century, and suggests that the lack of an entrenched aristocracy made social rank more fluid in America than in Europe. She ends the lecture by suggesting that the great importance that American colonists placed on British liberties and their link with Britain helped pave the way for the Revolution.","Today we’re going to be talking about being a British colonist, which means we’re going to be discussing how you would feel if you were part of the British Empire in the mid-eighteenth century, living in the North American colonies shortly before the onset of the Revolution. Basically, you would really consider yourself lucky to belong to a powerful nation that granted its citizens, you believed, more liberty than any nation on earth. It was the most important possession of a civilized people, and of course the British people, colonists and all, felt that they were at the peak of the civilized world. I suppose it’s related to what I said on Tuesday. Now of course the British agreed generally with this assessment of colonial society. I just think there’s — these guys have a real vim and vigor for finding the little zippy, stingy, nasty statement. West Indian planters were so focused on money, money crops, they actually didn’t even bother to grow their own food. Lo and behold, he gets there and he finds that actually in Virginia there’s a kind of an inner core of men, self-made men, who had been there for awhile, or their families had been there for awhile, and basically they controlled most of the land, they controlled most of the government offices, they had most of the power, and thus they could exclude Bacon and others from getting what they wanted. That’s possible too, but still it actually was a serious insult. And he says in his diary, no matter where he went, he was called Colonel, which amazed him because he said not only had he never had any military service but — and I don’t know what this means; I don’t know enough about him to know — but he kept saying over and over again, ‘I really don’t look like a military person, nothing about me,’ so I’m imagining this sort of sloppy, scary guy who’s wandering around in the back country of South Carolina and people are saying, ‘Colonel,’ , — wow — and people usually loved that. He wrote about it in his diary because he liked it so much; this made him a happy guy. So the person of the highest social rank is listed at the top of the class and the person of the lowest social rank is listed at the bottom of the class, and at commencement ceremonies or graduation ceremonies the highest in rank was the one who got to speak the longest and give the longest public address — and obviously because, as I’ve been saying, things are less entrenched, what this meant was lots of really petty, nasty squabbling at a lot of universities because everybody had a complaint. ‘ So while all Englishmen believed in the importance of political liberty and legislative representation and the rule of law and all of these things I’ve started to talk about, the colonies were full of people who either themselves had left England or were descended from people who had left England when that kind of belief was at an all-time high, so colonial governments embodied that spirit to a really extreme degree. Were they dependent on the mother country or were they just contributors to the greater empire? And some colonists would come to have a clear answer to those kinds of questions. So essentially some colonists would argue not only were they English, but they made personal sacrifices for England; they had tamed a wilderness for England, for the sake of the empire."
511,history,hist-116,lecture-3,Professor Freeman discusses the differences between society in the American colonies and society in Britain in the eighteenth century. She uses examples from colonists’ writings to show that the American colonies differed from British society in three distinct ways: the distinctive character of the people who migrated to the colonies; the distinctive conditions of life in British America; and the nature of British colonial administration.,"So Thursday, last — long ago, last week, we began to set the scene for this course by talking about the experience of being a British colonist, and as you remember we talked about the connection the colonists had with England both positive and negative; we talked about their sense of England — and particularly London — as being the sort of the center of the empire and almost the center of the universe; and we talked about the colonists’ simultaneous concerns about maybe not quite being as good as the people who were at that wonderful sophisticated center of the universe. And what I’m going to be talking about today is the ways in which the colonists and the colonies were different from people back in the mother country. And I’ll — Actually, I’ll add here one little brief point, and that is I’m — in a sense this is touching on something that I’m going to be focusing on in Thursday’s lecture — and that’s the idea that to many people — and you’ll hear it sort of underlying what he’s saying here — to many people, their individual colony really was what felt to them like their country, and people often referred to — Jefferson called Virginia “my country” well into the 1790s, if not beyond. And actually Pennsylvania, which is where I think he is at this point, was known at the time for being particularly diverse. So let’s start off first by looking at that first category of difference, the character of the people who migrated to the colonies — and, as you’ll see, in some ways a distinctive kind of person migrated to the colonies — or at least tended to — in ways that will make perfect sense. They were people who wanted something, maybe to better their condition, and they weren’t afraid to act on that desire, to reach for it. In the Old World, naturally enough, things were more tradition-bound. So I want to look for just a couple of minutes at how voting actually worked in the colonies, and it varies from colony to colony, so again I’m talking in a general kind of a way here. There were a lot of people mulling about. So obviously this is a very personal process in which certainly you could feel some pressure to vote a certain way. So more landholding, broader franchise and everything that that entails, more of a middling society, and now yet another colonial difference that I hinted about at the start of today’s lecture: the fact that several generations of colonists had lived and died in the colonies having never been to England. And as a matter of fact it spread to the colonies from England and from Ireland, but its impact on the colonies would be different when you combined it with some of the other things that were distinctive about colonial society and life as I’m talking about here. There is no other reason to be given why you have not gone to hell since you have sat here. As he describes it,“In 1739 arrived among us from Ireland  of that number, to observe the extraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers and how much they admired and respected him, notwithstanding his common abuse of them, by assuring them that they were naturally “half beasts and half devils. Another stroke of his oratory made me ashamed of that and determined me to give the silver; and he finished so admirably that I emptied my whole pocket into the dish, gold and all. First, the realities of living on a frontier, which not only fostered a sense of independence, but also a sense of community, partly in a defensive way because of fears about Indians and because of the difficulties of forging a homestead or creating a community. On a more positive side, colonists generally had healthier living conditions than in England. So we have the type of person who migrated; we just had a whole bunch of living conditions in the colonies. You can hear this sort of mixture of things in a comment by a British officer in the colonies during the French and Indian War. ’So we’ve looked at being a British colonist."
512,history,hist-116,lecture-4,Professor Freeman discusses colonial attempts to unite before the 1760s and the ways in which regional distrust and localism complicated matters. American colonists joined together in union three times before the 1760s. Two of these attempts were inspired by the necessity of self-defense; the third attempt was instigated by the British as a means of asserting British control over the colonies.,"So let’s actually begin today’s lecture, which is titled “Ever At Variance and Foolishly Jealous — Intercolonial Relations.” And the quote part of that title, “Ever At Variance and Foolishly Jealous,” actually comes from a colonist named Joseph Warren who was writing to a friend, probably 1766, I think — it doesn’t matter; it’s — actually the quote’s not highly significant for you — but the point of it is, he was writing to a friend and what he says to his friend is: until the passage of the Stamp Act the colonies had always been, quote, “ever at variance and foolishly jealous,” which is kind of going to be the point of today’s lecture. “ So we’ve looked at the links between colonists and the mother country, we’ve looked at aspects of colonial life and settlement that were kind of distinctly colonial American, and now we’re sort of laying the last plank in, of the British-American mindset at the time, and that’s: how the colonies were relating with each other. “The latter reside principally in the seaport towns, the former in the interior country. Now John Adams, with a little bit of a dose of Puritan guilt, felt that New Englanders were the best trained in the school of popular government but that they weren’t really skilled in personal relations. There were three different ways in which colonies were founded, and these differences could sometimes affect the structure of the colony and its relations with the mother country. So those are kind of basic structural institutional differences between these three kinds of colonies. The middle colonies were flooded by immigrants from Germany, from Ireland, from Scotland, to name just a few countries. And what he meant by that was: unlike a lot of other states or colonies actually, not yet states, colonies, it was organized around great landowners who owned vast expanses of land. And the Livingstons are the sort of largest and most noteworthy political clan in New York, and I can vouch to you as a historian of this time period that when you’re studying New York politics there are a million Livingstons and they’re all named Philip. I don’t expect someone to say that in 1799, “a good swift kick in the can.” He’s a Pennsylvanian and he says New Yorkers talk really fast, walk really fast, they do everything really fast in New York. They’re sort of really businesslike and abrupt. So, wherever you’re living is going to shape how you act — so the national office holders are going to act — if they’re in New York — kind of snooty, and then the American public’s going to look at these snooty people and they’re going to try to act like the snooty people, and thus all of America will become aristocratic and corrupt and that’s the end of the republican experiment in government. So we’ve got three ex-Presidents who are standing over the Virginia student body who are going to reprimand them for shooting off their guns. And supposedly — I always find this sort of touching. The response of Virginia to what they perceived to be the impingement of Britain upon their rights was second in intensity, as we’re going to see, only to what took place in Massachusetts and particularly in Boston. Even more unfortunate, Andros was not a very diplomatic politician and he really had no reason to be diplomatic. And there were a number of other highly unpopular things that he did. This did not end well for Washington and basically he ultimately had to surrender."
513,history,hist-116,lecture-5,"Professor Freeman concludes her discussion (from the previous lecture) of the three early instances in which the American colonies joined together to form a union. She then turns to a discussion of the Stamp Act crisis, and how American colonists found a shared bond through their dissatisfaction with the Stamp Act. Faced with massive national debts incurred by the recent war with France, Prime Minister George Grenville instituted several new taxes to generate revenue for Britain and its empire. The colonists saw these taxes as signaling a change in colonial policy, and thought their liberties and rights as British subjects were being abused. These feelings heightened with the Stamp Act of 1765. Finding a shared cause in their protestations against these new British acts, Americans set the foundation for future collaboration between the colonies.","So today I do want to finish discussing the good, old Albany Congress of 1754. I think I mentioned at the very end of the lecture that nine colonies were invited to the Albany Congress: Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. Now as I mentioned before — I think it’s one or two lectures ago — before this crisis, with the close of the French and Indian War, colonial love and respect for things English was at a real high because during that war the colonists had fought alongside English soldiers against England’s long-time enemy, the French, and had won. But once he began to focus on this problem, it became easy to see why smuggling was so widespread. So not surprisingly, what this meant in part was, some of the people left in charge were probably less than focused on their duties. So what we’re going to see again and again and again in one way or another is: the British assume that the colonists are going to do one particular thing or that they’re going to think in a particular way, and the colonists end up doing or thinking something different. I’m going to come back to that again in today’s lecture. But the colonists only saw that the English suddenly seemed to be putting teeth into the imperial system to really enforce rules and regulations. Third, they were alarmed at the implications of the Currency Act because the implications are, if you think about it, Grenville basically saying he can nullify an act passed by a colonial assembly. And then finally, fourth, colonists were also alarmed that these new duties and these new acts that are being enforced were largely intended to fund a standing army in the colonies, a standing army that Parliament saw as being protective, but you can also see how the colonists might have seen this as a threat. They don’t have a direct representative in Parliament, they’re upset, they’re trying to figure out what to do about it — but I think that little hole in the system was also revealing itself at this point. I look for opportunities to live my history but it doesn’t happen that often. I actually was doing research and I went down to the island of Nevis in the Caribbean, which is where Alexander Hamilton is from. I had to paste it in a book and I had to swear an oath of some kind. It was just — I couldn’t find the stamp man and it — I just had a Revolution flashback. We’re talking about fundamental rights being violated, people feeling that there’s something more than just, ‘I don’t like paying taxes’ — but it’s what that means, what this whole way of operating suggests and implies about fundamental rights about the position of the colonists within the empire. We have the threat of directly overriding colonial legislation and legislatures. Upon which the same member stood up again” and it says in parenthesis “(I think his name is Henry) and said that if he had affronted the Speaker of the House he was ready to ask pardon and he would show his loyalty to His Majesty King George the Third at the expense of the last drop of his blood, but what he had said must be attributed to the interest of his country’s dying liberty which he had at heart. And the heat of passion might have led him to say something more that he intended; but, again, if he said anything wrong he begged the speaker and the House’s pardon. So that’s the eyewitness account, which is not quite like the legend, but the fact is actually Henry did speak pretty boldly and he did talk about his country’s dying liberty, which says a lot about what we’re talking about right now, that — the colonial perception of lost English liberties."
514,history,hist-116,lecture-6,"Professor Freeman discusses the mounting tensions between the colonists and the British in the late 1760s and early 1770s. The Virginia Resolves were published and read throughout the colonies in 1765, and generated discussion about colonial rights and liberties. Colonies began working together to resolve their problems, and formed the Stamp Act Congress in 1765. Meanwhile, Boston was becoming more radicalized and mobs began acting out their frustration with British policies. Colonists began to believe that the British were conspiring to oppress their liberties, a belief that seemed to be confirmed when the British stationed troops in Boston. The mounting tension between the Bostonians and British troops culminated in the violence of the Boston Massacre in March 1770.","Tuesday we ended with the angry response in the colonies to the passage of the Stamp Act, 1765. However, they were published in Rhode Island. So in June of 1765, the Massachusetts assembly sends a circular letter to all of the colonial assemblies — and a circular letter is kind of what it sounds like, a letter intended to circulate — to all of the colonial assemblies inviting them to meet in a congress in New York in October of 1765, quote, “to consider of a general and united, dutiful, loyal and humble representation of their condition to His Majesty and the parliament and to implore relief.” So —So far we’ve largely been talking about speechifying, paper-pushing, resolves, declarations, newspaper announcements, but in Boston we’re now about to see some physical resistance. Now it’s important to note that mobs in early America weren’t sort of wild, violent, out-of-control, ‘oh, my gosh, it’s a riot’ kind of actions. They were usually focused on protecting the good of the community from things like unfairly high food prices or illegal business practices. So these radicals decide they’re going to take action. Everything I’ve talked about is leading up to it actually going into effect. To the colonists, because it mentioned legislation but not taxes, it seemed to suggest that maybe they had made their point, that Parliament is not going to assert taxation. Clearly, this is not the time to be a Prime Minister in England. So — Rocky time was not meant to be a pun. We cannot be free without being secure in our property. If you think about it, potentially, it’s a scary thing. However, the British Secretary of State, Lord Hillsborough, really saw this as organized resistance and refused to stand for it. So in 1768, privately consulting with the King, so kind of doing this off on the side, he instructed the Governor of Massachusetts to dissolve the Massachusetts assembly unless they took back the letter. There seems to be some kind of organized attack on colonial liberties, and I’m emphasizing plan and system and organized because next week that’s the direction we’re going to be going with the lectures. Meanwhile, Parliament, eventually, in 1770, repeals most of the Townshend Acts but does preserve the tax on tea, partly for revenue and partly to prove that they still have the right to tax the colonies. Again Adams is propagandizing so he’s always saying things with a sort of extra twist, but what he’s saying is, it was very clear that when the troops arrived they were treating us like lowly rebels and that they were sent here to subdue us. Now first off, it’s important to understand that the Boston Massacre wasn’t this little isolated moment of conflict between soldiers and citizens. Now from this point we have several accounts. But snowballs are — Everyone’s complaining about snowballs in these accounts you’ll see. He defended himself as well as he could, calling out for help. So Gage is trying to explain to royal authorities a shooting that never should have happened. So you can really see from these two accounts, and from the details contained within them, the animosity and the sense of alienation between the colonists and the soldiers on both sides, and you can also see really dramatically the fears on both sides that there’s some kind of a plot; there’s some kind of a plot of resistance or tyranny, depending on which side you’re on."
515,history,hist-116,lecture-7,"Professor Freeman continues her discussion of the Boston Massacre and how it represented a growing sense of alienation between the American colonists and the British authorities. The Americans and British both felt that the colonies were subordinate to Parliament in some way, but differed in their ideas of the exact nature of the imperial relationship. This period saw the formation of non-importation associations to discourage merchants from importing British goods, as well as committees of correspondence to coordinate resistance. One instance of such resistance occurred in December 1773, when Boston radicals who were frustrated with the Tea Act threw shipments of tea into Boston Harbor.","Last week we ended with the Boston Massacre in 1770, and I mentioned at the very end of the lecture the ways in which both onlookers in the British government and the colonists ended up wondering, each one, if the other one was somehow engaged in a plot. At the same time that he’s writing all these sort of propaganda newspaper accounts and trying to stir up animosity, he also was writing letters to people in England trying to persuade them and hopefully inspire them to persuade others that the people of Boston were rightfully defending their liberties and deserved to be defended by people in Parliament, not condemned and punished. And this is a really great example of why it’s always important — and I think it’s particularly important when studying anything in the founding era, but I think history generally — but when studying the Revolution or the founding era — but when studying the Revolution, it’s important not to jump on to the independence bandwagon too quickly and assume that a separation is inevitable, because the people that we’re studying did not assume that. They’re trying to figure out how to fix things. So between 1768 and 1770, as they begin to contemplate boycotting British goods yet again, people begin to form non-importation associations, okay? Everything is forty-seven, so when you go to Pomona, it’s like the magic of forty-seven constantly being talked about. Now in the South, the non-importation associations were more centered on the populace, not quite as centered on merchants, so southern non-importation associations were often very careful to have members sign on from throughout the community, so not just merchants but artisans and planters. They’re not competing with colonial assemblies. So some onlookers in Britain began to regret the Townshend Acts. So now we’re in 1770 and surprise, surprise, by this time we have a new Prime Minister. It means I get to say whatever I want and I get to tell random stories — but this actually does demonstrate the sort of ritual of tea drinking everywhere. So the whole tea ceremony was important in the colonies. Parliament thinks well, we are still maintaining our sovereignty so our point stands firm. But unfortunately about the same time, in June of 1772, there was a crisis in Rhode Island. That’s kind of a strong anti-British “we hate that you’re stopping smuggling” act. So by the end of November of 1772, the committee had produced an open letter to all of the towns in Massachusetts urging them, quote, not “to doze or sit supinely indifferent on the brink of destruction” — that Samuel Adams; he’s really a master at the strong words — and to create their own committees of correspondence. And you can kind of see this person’s fears. Okay, so somewhat paradoxically by reducing the duty on English tea, North helped fuel colonial fears that there was a plot in England against colonial rights — which inspired the colonists to imagine the worst immediately when a suspicious act was passed. So when ships loaded with tea began arriving in major colonial ports, obviously things become more heated. You have, Sir, no government, no governor, the whole are the proceedings of a tumultuous and riotous rabble, who ought, if they had the least prudence, to follow their mercantile employment, and not trouble themselves with politics and government, which they do not understand.” They’re not politicians, and look what they’re doing."
516,history,hist-116,lecture-8,"Professor Freeman lays out the logic of American resistance to British imperial policy during the 1770s. Prime Minister Lord North imposed the Intolerable Acts on Massachusetts to punish the radicals for the Boston Tea Party, and hoped that the act would divide the colonies. Instead, the colonies rallied around Massachusetts because they were worried that the Intolerable Acts set a new threatening precedent in the imperial relationship. In response to this seeming threat, the colonists formed the First Continental Congress in 1774 to determine a joint course of action. The meeting of the First Continental Congress is important for four reasons: it forced the colonists to clarify and define their grievances with Britain; it helped to form ties between the colonies; it served as a training ground for young colonial politicians; and in British eyes, it symbolized a step towards rebellion. The lecture concludes with a look at the importance of historical lessons for the colonists, and how these lessons helped form a “logic of resistance” against the new measures that Parliament was imposing upon the colonies.","Someone asked me at the end of class on Tuesday a very good question, and the question is: what exactly is a broadside? And we’ll see this again and again — that there is sort of a fundamental misunderstanding about when and what ends up seeming like a joint threat to the colonists so that they act together versus what doesn’t inspire them to act together. But equally if not more important, people in other colonies assumed if it could happen in Boston, it could happen anywhere. So in essence Lord North’s actions did the precise opposite of what they were meant to do, because they really ultimately brought the colonies closer together in a shared sense of crisis. And in Massachusetts, the land of propaganda, this became known as the Murder Act. But independence is not the natural choice. They’re thinking that they need to find a way to get the British imperial system to work in a way that they see as being right. Most of the delegates to that Congress already had some political experience in their separate colonies. None of them were absolute uncompromising radicals who wanted to rip everything apart. I will provide you the historian with the big, broad, wonderful quote about the Continental Congress. Isaac Newton, a second man of science who studied gravity and the laws of motion, and Newton’s work demonstrated that it was possible through reason and study to discover the laws of nature and of nature’s God. And in a way the ultimate example of this — I think I’ve mentioned it once before in here; I’m not sure — is James Madison preparing for the Constitutional Convention and he’s very much — he’s right in line with this kind of thinking. He probably wasn’t intending to signal some big threat to the American republic. No one actually ever absolutely knows why he said this and that says more about Hamilton than anything else. It’s hard to know, but at any rate it’s unclear what Hamilton’s logic is, but you can certainly understand Jefferson’s shocked response, and either way, both the comment and the response reveal the power of the classical heritage on this early American world. a new precedent that ultimately would be making some kind of inroad against liberty and property rights. As John Dickinson wrote in — I’ve mentioned before his really well-known pamphlet from 1768 called Dickinson wrote, “Nothing is wanted at home” — and by home he means Britain — “but a precedent, the force of which shall be established by the tacit submission of the colonies… . And eventually down the road, the colonists would come to see their social contract with the British government broken, a conclusion which would seem to then give them the right of community resistance, but as I’ve said before it’s important to recognize that the colonists at this point see their actions not as revolutionary but just the opposite. In early 1775, Edmund Burke gave one of his best known speeches in Parliament. Because they’re descendants of liberty-loving English citizens."
517,history,hist-116,lecture-9,"The lecture first concludes the discussion of the First Continental Congress, which met in 1774. Ultimately, although its delegates represented a range of opinions, the voices of the political radicals in the Congress were the loudest. In October 1774, the Continental Congress passed both the radical Suffolk Resolves and the Declaration and Resolves, which laid out the colonists’ grievances with Parliament. The Congress also sent a petition to the King which warned him that the British Parliament was stripping the American colonists of their rights as English citizens. Given such radical measures, by early 1775, many American colonists were choosing sides in the growing conflict, and many chose to be Loyalists. Professor Freeman concludes her lecture with a discussion of the varied reasons why different Loyalists chose to support the British Crown, and what kinds of people tended to be Loyalists in the American Revolution.","Today we’re talking about Loyalists, and in doing so we’re going to be talking about the range of responses to the building crisis in British America. Not everybody in the Congress agreed on the level of what needed to be done. You had a spectrum of opinions throughout society. Resolved, That in this general Time of resolving, we have as good a right to resolve as the most resolute.” The eternal joke of people splitting their pants. But they were not introduced by Massachusetts delegates. Clearly, those are really radical resolutions on a bunch of levels. He called it, I think, the Grand Council, and it would be elected by colonial assemblies. Now interestingly, the vote over Galloway’s plan of union was close but it was ultimately defeated, and I suppose looking back in the long view of time it probably wasn’t likely that the British government would have approved of the creation of a kind of second colonial parliament. And, as we’ll see, that’s unlikely particularly when you look later at how Parliament responded to these continental congresses, and in a sense you could say the Continental Congress was a sort of temporary version of a Grand Council. Could they actually even sit down and make a statement that everybody agreed on?And the difficulties that the delegates had in writing this draft really demonstrates once again how really difficult it was to define the precise terms of the colonies’ problem with the mother country, the precise terms for the proper relationship between the colonies and the mother country. And the Declaration and Resolves was drafted by a committee. But this time they decided to really form a network of local non-importation committees and towns throughout the colonies to actually enforce non-importation. They can respond and take several months to communicate back with us and we’ll see what happens, and if we haven’t been addressed we will have another continental congress in May of 1775.’Now as you can imagine, the adjournment of the First Continental Congress left relations between the colonies and the mother country in kind of a precarious state. The Congress and its activities also made it increasingly obvious that there were two sides forming on the question of the proper workings of the imperial system and how best to respond to the ongoing problem. Actually, a couple of — Actually, a good number of years ago, I had someone write a senior essay with me and he found a diary from roughly this period of a person whose family — he was from New England and I don’t remember where he was from — his family divided over what to do. After the war, Dr. Benjamin Rush — who, as you’ll hear in this little quote, was obviously supportive of colonial resistance — explained that to him there had been four different kinds of Torys during the Revolution. So it obviously varied region by region, depending on local circumstances. So in a way, you could say that many Loyalists were simply more afraid of the rebelling colonies than they were of the Crown. They weren’t sure what would happen if they did."
518,history,hist-119,lecture-10,"This lecture picks off where the previous one left off, with a discussion of the legacies of John Brown. The most important thing about John Brown’s raid, Professor Blight argues, was not the event itself, but the way Americans engaged with it after the fact. Next, Professor Blight discusses the election of 1860, a four-way battle won by the Republican candidate, Abraham Lincoln. In the wake of Lincoln’s election, the seven states of the deep South, led by South Carolina, seceded. The lecture closes with an analysis of some of the rationales underlying southern secession.","Faster than might seem appropriate, and faster than I wish, we’ve come to the secession crisis. I wish we had another week, two, three weeks, but we don’t. Europe was essentially a Christian civilization. There were escape plans in the newspapers. There are many other cases in our history of people who acted in a cause and used violence. But John Brown forces us to face the almost natural ambivalences about his acts. Why has John Brown been such a romantic hero in black culture, in poetry, in painting, in song? DuBois gave a speech about John Brown at Harpers Ferry in 1932. It is out of that human paradox that there comes any crucifixion. Now, the front running candidate of the Democratic Party by 1860 — and this man had been working for this for a decade and a half — was, of course, Stephen Douglas of Illinois; the same Stephen Douglas of Popular Sovereignty fame. And Douglas kept trying to dance around it, avoid it. The hope of saving the Union, just in a political sense, by 1860 was with the Democrats. And everybody knows that when a party does this, it almost guarantees it will lose, and they did. Southerners were really reading the Republican Party platform. And this Lincoln, after all he was born in Kentucky, he’s kind of a border state guy himself; Seward’s just a Yankee. And that’s exactly what happened in this case. And this is where your book, by Charles Dew, , comes right into play here — that wonderfully short and I think quite brilliant treatment of the secession commissioners — as South Carolina was the first state to send out secession commissioners to other states in the Deep South and basically say, “Please join us, we’re hanging out on this limb, it’s scary out here, and here are the reasons you should join us. One, is what we might simply call, what I’ve just argued, the preservation of a slave society, the preservation of a slave system, the preservation of a certain kind of racial control over a society that they now greatly feared would be threatened. It was really an argument between waiting till ‘64, or the argument used by Southern slaveholders now — people from south Georgia, and all over the Deep South — it was the theory of a shrinking south. And I really do believe this is one of the most compelling arguments they had about secession and it’s why they were able to muster enough folks to go with them in their revolution. Prices of slaves would continue to go down. The third is what I will call Southern nationalism. Members of a country, he said, cannot divorce."
519,history,hist-119,lecture-11,"Professor Blight begins this lecture with an attempt to answer the question “why did the South secede in 1861?” Blight offers five possible answers to this question: preservation of slavery, “the fear thesis,” southern nationalism, the “agrarian thesis,” and the “honor thesis.” After laying out the roots of secession, Blight focuses on the historical profession, suggesting some of the ways in which historians have attempted to explain the coming of the Civil War. Blight begins with James Ford Rhodes, a highly influential amateur historian in the late nineteenth century, and then introduces Charles and Mary Beard, whose economic interpretations of the Civil War had their heyday in the 1920s and 1930s.","Can I hear a “conflicting civilizations?” Can I hear “Goddamn Yankees?”Or Jefferson Davis may have captured the kind of toxin that was in the air, around southern secession, in late 1860 and into this “distracted, sad year,” as Whitman called it, of 1861. The South should, by the instinct of self-preservation, be united. Davis seemed to think a little bit was at stake, for the South, in 1861.However, after the war, Jefferson Davis wrote what is probably the longest, most turgid, belabored, 1200 page defense of a failed political revolution in the history of language. Never was there happier dependents of labor and capital on each other. Now I could go on and on with this particular, incredible passage. And I’d already talked about how the preservation of slavery, a slave society, a society ordered by slave labor and so forth, was a principle, if not the principle, purpose of this secession movement, at least in the Deep South, where it succeeded. As of March 1861, when Lincoln was to be inaugurated, the majority of the slave states are still in the Union, not out; only South Carolina over to Texas, the whatever-color-that-is of the Deep South, was the Confederate States of America. The four states that will join it — we’ll come to this on Thursday — do not secede, of course, until after Fort Sumter. John Brown had sort of made this equation, that had always been there in the southern mind in vague ways, explicit. And Ruffin sent one of those pikes to the governor of every southern state. It’s rooted in the shrinking south theory, it’s rooted in the desire to preserve a slave society — but it’s the idea that the South’s ultimate welfare would be better outside of the union than in, requiring a certain thinking about how to create a new nation. This is the vague theory that secession was to protect an agrarian, agricultural, planter civilization. When is he speaking from a vision of an independent southern national future, is never easy to know, but you can hear it in a James Jones, for example, a leading South Carolina secessionist in the South Carolina Secession Convention who got up at the end of the arguments and he said, well folks, quote, “If we fail we have saved our honor and lost nothing.” They will say the American Republic has been an experiment; it’s been a fascinating, wonderful, world historical experiment. It is a theory of the nature of federalism. But he grew up helplessly fascinated with this event that forged his life, his world. Slavery was a broad force, almost like climate, it was almost like bad weather, and no one is to blame for bad weather. Now, this put in place — and I’ll leave it there — a kind of nationalist, reconciliationist, quasi-scholarly, popular historical tradition through which most other interpretations of the Civil War causation would now have to pass or breathe or move."
520,history,hist-119,lecture-12,"After finishing with his survey of the manner in which historians have explained the coming of the Civil War, Professor Blight focuses on Fort Sumter. After months of political maneuvering, the Civil War began when Confederates fired on Fort Sumter, in the harbor outside Charleston, SC. The declaration of hostilities prompted four more states–Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Arkansas–to secede. Professor Blight closes the lecture with a brief discussion of some of the forces that motivated Americans–North and South–to go to war.","I suppose every war, the short ones and the long ones, the ones that get televised and the ones that don’t, the ones where we get to see the coffins and the ones where we don’t, have their romance and their reality. But then it’s the same Ambrose Bierce, one of the most — certainly I think, the unique American writer about the Civil War in so many ways — a kind of bitter, brutal realist who was wounded three times in the war, hit in the head with a shell shot from a cannon, should’ve died — crushed in part of his skull, which may explain Ambrose Bierce actually — but it’s Bierce who also wrote that lovely little line where he said, “the soil of peace is thickly sewn with the seeds of war.” Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war, rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war, rather than let it perish. Don Fehrenbacher may have captured that interpretation best in a line when he said, “The Civil War came and it was fought to bring” — how did he put it — “to bring great national progress at great national cost.” Now that’s an utterly horribly streamlined way of saying — you don’t find many historians anymore who argue from a needless war perspective, although what you do find is a kind of rollercoaster ride through American scholarship about the Civil War, sometimes deeply influenced by Vietnam and sometimes deeply influenced, even today — some have argued about Skip Stout’s book; if you know Professor Stout. He has a remarkable new book out about whether the American Civil War was a just war. It was put up in the early twentieth century. If Lincoln and the Republicans are going to make a stand against secession — and once he finally comes into office — by the way the day he entered office all that federal property had been taken by those seven states, it’s already done; he inherits this situation. And there’s much been said over the years about Lincoln over-estimating Union sentiment across the South. Now, there were hawks in his administration, there were hawks in the Republican Party who wanted him to act faster. On the 11 of April Major Anderson, in the fort, was given a chance to surrender by the authorities in Charleston. Now, the most important immediate result of the firing on Fort Sumter, of course, was the secession of the Upper South, part of the Upper South. He probably said something like it, somewhere, but I just couldn’t resist using it; I’ve used it for so many years. Note where it is, it’s right above Washington, D.C. Approximately 50,000 white men fought for the Union, in Maryland, in the Civil War. One of them fought in the 6 Maryland Infantry, a Union regiment. Our country and property is worth nothing if we don’t, nor will life be secure.” Now, another argument here, and again Phil Paludan has made this better than anyone I think, is he’s argued that southerners and northerners have sort of come to view the U.S. Constitution, this document we live under, in different ways; that northerners had come to see the Constitution as a kind of protector, much violated now by Kansas-Nebraska Act, Dred Scott decision, et cetera, whereas southerners had come to see that constitution more as a destroyer, as something to fear, that might, if the wrong people get hold of it, begin to attack or erode their society. Okay Mary, I get it — divorce papers — you hate us."
521,history,hist-119,lecture-13,"Professor Blight discusses the expectations, advantages, and disadvantages with which North and South entered the Civil War. Both sides, he argues, expected and desired a short, contained conflict. The northern advantages enumerated in this lecture include industrial capability, governmental stability, and a strong navy. Confederate advantages included geography and the ability to fight a defensive war. Professor Blight concludes the lecture with the Battle of Bull Run, the first major engagement of the war.","This week you’re reading , the short and in some ways extraordinary little novel, written by Louisa May Alcott, based upon her — Louisa May Alcott of fame, if you happen to have grown up on that book, daughter of Bronson Alcott, a famous and extremely eccentric New England reformer and utopian — but she went to war, as a young nurse — couldn’t stay away — and she kept her sketches about her experiences of a young woman confronting the horror of Civil War hospitals. I think what you can find in Alcott’s novel, among other things — it’s almost like a descriptive documentary novel; it’s almost like she summed up her diary — is the human encounter, particularly a woman’s, a young woman’s encounter with what war does to the human body, the human psyche, to human beings. At any rate, I was astonished at the reaction in Germany. Probably because Burns is a sentimental filmmaker, and there’s a great deal of sentiment in the structure, and in the music and in the mode of that film series. Over the next five — including Spring Break week — you’re in Jamaica, Spring Break week, you can access Ken Burns’ film, you can be humming the “Ashokan Farewell” in the shower with somebody in Jamaica. If you have any problem with this let us know immediately and we will help you. But in those two sections of Gienapp and Johnson, if you haven’t looked yet — and you should — you get, day by day in some cases, you get Lincoln’s orders and dispatches to his generals, his attempt to become the War President, including that first document in that section where Lincoln lays — right after the disaster at Bull Run — he lays out nine or ten very direct orders, all beginning with the word “let”: let there be this, let there be that, let there by this, let there by that. It’s also apocalyptic; some would say purple in its blood. There are many extraordinary witnesses to these breakups at West Point. The North had four times — oh I already said that, the bank deposits, forgive me. Of the 470 locomotives made in the United States by 1860, only nineteen of them had been made in the South. It did not have to create a government; it already had one, it had a functioning government. You could argue that the South had a great advantage of geography, if they used it well. When they chose to invade the North, as Lee will twice, two fateful invasions, the one resulting at Antietam in September of ‘62 and the other at Gettysburg in July of ‘63, he was giving up that advantage of the defensive position, forcing the larger armies of the North to come to them and attack on southern ground, on southern soil. If they could hold out long enough and force the North into a degree of war weariness, into some kind of economic trauma, they might just sue for peace. After all, the goal of the Confederacy was national independence. How many of you want your sons to die for the social order? They will also buy a lot from Great Britain, from the French to some extent, and much of that will get in through the blockade in the first two years. It would take time, patience and an ever-growing Navy. One man is alleged to have sold himself twenty times for the bounty that he got paid to get out. Generous bounties were paid if you enlisted, and in the end only about six percent of all the Union forces in the Civil War were draftees."
522,history,hist-119,lecture-14,"Professor Blight lectures on the military history of the early part of the war. Beginning with events in the West, Blight describes the Union victories at Fort Donelson and Fort Henry, introduces Union General Ulysses S. Grant, and narrates the horrific battle of Shiloh, fought in April of 1862. Moving back East, the lecture describes the Union General George McClellan’s abortive 1862 Peninsula campaign, which introduced the world to Confederate General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. The lecture concludes with Confederate General Robert E. Lee’s decision to take the battle to the North.","The person whose writing drew me into the Civil War — and I confess — was Bruce Catton. That is exactly what it had become by the summer of 1862.And here is Catton’s description; I can’t do it any better: “There was nobility in the idea that there ought to be a peace without victory. The peacemakers could not be heard until the terrible swift sword had been sheathed. But man, when he held a parade it was cool. And at one point he called Lincoln “a baboon.” Now, at first the war in the West was essentially fought with gunboats, little ironclad gunboats, and armies on the land. They flowed down to Nashville, one of them. The other flowed southward and then into Northern Georgia. These rivers would be invasion corridors, if you like, invasion paths for the Northern armies. And he’s describing Grant’s situation in Galena and how bored he was and depressed he was and so on. It was a way out of a leather store, and for some men it is much more than that, it is the fulfillment that the world will yield in no other manner. About one-third of it was under the command of a general named Don Carlos Buell, and he was in central Tennessee, Grant’s forces were sort of more western Tennessee, and both were slowly trying to move down toward southwestern Tennessee and maybe even into Mississippi to find this Confederate Army, in March and early April of ‘62.What happened was that Albert Sidney Johnston attempted a surprise attack, and it was one of the most successful surprise attacks by these large unwieldy armies that ever happened in this war. Grant’s troops were literally caught with their pants down. The first day at Shiloh was a complete Confederate victory. But this is where — I don’t want to make McClellan into just comic relief like Burns does; I think he overdoes it — but here it is important to understand that generals did have impact on this war. But McClellan was always overestimating his enemy. He was 27-years-old, he felt like a total failure in life. And if it were not for the regiment I see before me, each with his deadly end-field rifle on his shoulder, I could hardly imagine that there was a war anywhere in the land. I had the best view of the army in motion there that I ever had as they came down a long slope of low hills to the creek and then up the other side, and as we arrived at the top of the latter slope I turned and took a look back and could see the long line, looking like an enormous snake winding back for two and three miles, and bristling with bayonets, and at a short distance the Stars and Stripes and the flags of different states and the guidons, presenting a scene that occurs but once in a great while. Lee decides in the face of a kind of quiescent McClellan to leave only a small force in Richmond, and move north into Virginia and invade the north. And the reason Antietam is the first major turning point of this war is not just because of the decisive battle they fought on the Maryland side of the Potomac, but because it will be the occasion to allow Abraham Lincoln to do what he’d been planning to do through much of that summer, and Congress had been prodding him to do, which was to announce to the world that this was a war to free the slaves."
523,history,hist-119,lecture-15,"Professor Blight follows Robert E. Lee’s army north into Maryland during the summer of 1862, an invasion that culminated in the Battle of Antietam, fought in September of 1862. In the wake of Antietam, Abraham Lincoln issued his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, a document that changed the meaning of the war forever. Professor Blight suggests some of the ways in which Americans have attempted to come to grips with the enigmatic Lincoln, and argues that, in the end, it may be Lincoln’s capacity for change that was his most important characteristic. The lecture concludes with the story of John Washington, a Virginia slave whose concerted action suggests the central role American slaves played in securing their own freedom.","I’m going to talk today about turning points, and on Thursday about turning points, and beyond that, probably, about turning points. The second major turning point in the war, militarily, I’d argue, as most people do, was the Battle of Gettysburg in July of 1863 and the day after the three days’ battle at Gettysburg. A fourth major turning point in the war, politically, without any question I think, is the Election of 1864, the only time in modern history that a republic attempted to hold a general election in the midst of civil war and succeeded in doing it. I’ll put the outline back up if we need it. Lee believed, as did other Confederate leaders, that in Maryland, in particular, there was a great deal of Confederate sympathy and sentiment, and a lot of young Maryland men, the theory was, eager to join the Confederate forces if they could just get out of Maryland. What they will do in Maryland, however, is capture several hundred slaves and return them, or take them, to Virginia. But the orders were lost, and they were found by a private in an Indiana regiment whose name was B.W. Mitchell — the 27 Indiana Volunteers to be exact — who picked up this bundle of three cigars, with paper wrapped around it, and he read the orders, and at the bottom it said, “R. E. Lee.” McClellan now has at his command about 90,000 troops. Lee retreated out of the South Mountain pass, down into this little valley around Sharpsburg, Maryland, which is just above the Potomac River. Now, let’s discuss Lincoln for a moment, first. We twist him all inside out and make him say whatever we want him to say. It came out about ten years ago, it’s called “A Marble House Divided.” He also wrote it at a time when he was fed up with all of the national honoring and celebration of Robert E. Lee. He believed in compensation to slave owners as a way, a hope, of setting up some kind of gradual emancipation plan. I was once given an assignment in a junior seminar as an undergraduate. Now this was a Congress, remember, that is now dominated by the Republican Party. It didn’t say what their status would be, it didn’t define anybody. The District of Columbia in 1862 had 3,100 slaves. He secretly held meetings with a delegation of Delaware, and a delegation from Kentucky, trying to convince them to institute gradual emancipation plans over time with compensation to slave owners that would free slaves over a 35-year period. But read that entire letter, not just that quote, I’m going to leave that to you; read the entire letter, because he’s actually honest on both sides of the semicolon. Look for his semicolon, and judge both sides. And in that narrative he tells this remarkable story of the day of his escape. He takes all the black workers up on the roof of the hotel where they could see across the river and see what he called “the gleam of the Yankees’ bayonets.”"
524,history,hist-119,lecture-16,"This lecture focuses on the process of emancipation after the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. The Proclamation, Professor Blight suggests, had four immediate effects: it made the Union army an army of emancipation; it encouraged slaves to strike against slavery; it committed the US to a policy of emancipation in the eyes of Europe; and it allowed African Americans to enlist in the Union Army. In the end, ten percent of Union soldiers would be African American. A number of factors, Professor Blight suggests, combined to influence the timing of emancipation in particular areas of the South, including geography, the nature of the slave society, and the proximity of the Union army.","The first formally recognized or organized black regiment in the Civil War was known as the First South Carolina Volunteers. And Higginson had his headquarters in an old plantation house. He looked out of broken windows, at this abandoned plantation in the Sea Islands, through what he described as “the great avenues of great live oaks,” and he observed that quote, “All this is a universal southern panorama, but five minutes walk beyond the hovels and the live oaks will bring one to something so unsouthern that the whole southern coast at this moment trembles at the suggestion of such a thing, a camp of a regiment of freed slaves. He had lived part of his life in Washington, DC, part of his life in Virginia, North Carolina; he’d been around. What they cared about is that the United States Government had acted and said they were going to be free. It really depended on all those deaths at Gettysburg and at Vicksburg and so many other horrible places. But sometimes history is ahead of anyone’s basic human, individual motives, isn’t it?But in this Conkling letter, so called, it’s a public letter that — Lincoln mastered this presidential art of the public letter more than any previous president and it was his version of the news conference, which didn’t happen in those days. The most that can be said, if so much, is that the slaves are property. You say you will not fight to free Negroes. I thought that in your struggle for the Union, to whatever extent the Negroes should cease helping the enemy, to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance to you. A lot of people have argued that the war is won and lost in the West because of the great significance of the Mississippi Valley, which had become the great cotton kingdom of the world. They were asked to describe their physical conditions. But almost to a man, these superintendents of contraband camps when asked what were the motives, they simply fall back on the most basic of things. Slaves, hundreds upon hundreds of slaves, were put to work building fortifications of Richmond. Seventy-two hours later by train he found himself on a huge cotton operation near Pickensville, Alabama, which is right about there, right on the Mississippi border, a plantation with about eighty-five slaves. He was one passionate — half-crazy, one might say — no doubt traumatized — teenage slave who just couldn’t be controlled. He was sold for $1000 to old Chalmers in Richmond. And Chalmers now got fed up in early ‘63 of constantly trying to retrieve this kid, and he took him down to Mobile, Alabama and sold him at the slave jail in Mobile in the spring of 1863 for $2000. And this, by the way, became a policy throughout the Union Army. If you could’ve heard how quaint and innocent it all was."
525,history,hist-119,lecture-17,"Professor Blight begins his lecture with a description of the sea change in Civil War scholarship heralded by the Social History revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. Along with a focus on the experience of the common solider, women, and African Americans, a central component of this shift in scholarly emphasis was an increased interest in the effects of the war on the Union and Confederate home fronts. After suggesting some of the ways in which individual Americans experienced the war, Professor Blight moves to a discussion of the war’s effect on industry and economics, North and South. The lecture concludes with a description of the increased activism of the federal government during the war, an activism that found expression in finance, agriculture, taxation, building railroads, and, most importantly, in emancipation.","Today we’re going to take up a question that has been for the past, well, nearly 20 years, probably the most active — to many the most stimulating aspect of Civil War scholarship. It taught us how to study social groups in historical time. I don’t know if any of you remember the old song by that title but it’s worth thinking about. At any rate, you get a book like Drew Faust’s, which stands on the shoulders of other books like it, but a book that went and read thousands of Southern women’s letters and diaries to try to understand “how did this war affect Southern white women?” And she has many answers to that, including the somewhat bold argument at the end of that book that it was women, in part — an argument that has been tested by other scholars and even backed off from a bit by Drew herself — but she ends the book at least with a suggestion that the sheer weight of the burden of the war on Southern white women and the thousands upon thousands of letters in which they express that to their mates, their husbands, their brothers, their sons at the front, that it was, in part, Southern white women that made the South give up the war. You know, you never think that anything is or can happen to you. Every day a soldier is lost or wounded by enemy attacks. All of her men are dead and she sits wailing to the sky, on a stone, crying, “How can this be?” Tragedy can be raw, it can be pointless, it can be utterly unbearable, it can be a dead-end with no exit. But sometimes tragedy, throughout its literary history, and then therefore how we tend to use it, tragedy can also be affirmative. During the war, as utterly consumed as Americans became with death, they weren’t writing yet about heaven. All right, I’m going to leave you there for the moment. The Civil War, the Beards wrote, I quote, “was a social war, ending in the unquestioned establishment of a new power in the government, making vast changes in the arrangement of classes, in the accumulation and distribution of wealth, in the course of industrial development. During the war years, the war retarded economic growth in some sectors but in the long run, especially in northern cities and towns, and especially with the mass mobilization now stimulated by the Federal Government, the war expanded the economy like nothing ever had before, so fast. It can measure loss of civilian pursuits. How do you measure the dislocation and fear of widows? How do you measure what it meant to become free? Now, let me give you one other example, or maybe two. But Southern society went to war and paid an enormous price, of course. And this is not to condemn them, this was their challenge, this is the risk they took, this is what they risked was secession in 1861. And really, frankly to understand — and I’ll leave you here — to understand how Northerners, the Republican Party, Lincoln himself and at least the majority of those Union troops came to support emancipation, the freeing of black people, by federal authority, you need to see it in the context of all else that this Republican Party was doing through the Federal Government."
526,history,hist-119,lecture-18,"This lecture probes the reasons for confederate defeat and union victory. Professor Blight begins with an elucidation of the loss-of-will thesis, which suggests that it was a lack of conviction on the home front that assured confederate defeat, before offering another of other popular explanations for northern victory: industrial capacity, political leadership, military leadership, international diplomacy, a pre-existing political culture, and emancipation. Blight warns, however, that we cannot forget the battlefield, and, to this end, concludes his lecture with a discussion of the decisive Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in July of 1863.","I want to start with what many Americans therefore do with it. But go back with me now to this question of Union victory, Confederate defeat. We’re not going to end the war today, that’s next week, and we’re going to take the war today through 1863, and major military turning points where you can begin to make an argument, from this point forward. And I would argue one other thing; and it’s really a third reason you can put on this long list of why the North’s going to win this war. Fifth, much has always been made about the so called, in the end, superior military leadership of the North, in the end. Now, this was fashioned by historians really who cut their teeth on the Vietnam Era. And Beringer and Hattaway have also argued that, in part, the South, once it begins to lose the war in ‘63 and ‘64, that it was Southern Unionists that began to come to the fore, that there were large — and there were — large pockets of unionism, people who didn’t really support the Confederate war effort, in western Virginia and western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, upland Georgia, in those hills that Sherman’s Army begins to move through and discovers there’s some white folk around who want to support him. There was one minstrel troop known as — these were whites in blackface, keeping morale up. Lee wanted to move all of his troops into Central Pennsylvania. And I’ll come back to this question next week about Lee’s own psyche for war and what they said happened to his eyes when it was time for battle. Casualties were ghastly; 28,000 casualties in three days — that’s dead, wounded and missing — on the Confederate side. My guy, Charlie Brewster, whose letters I edited, was actually held in reserve. And he reads that letter and he quotes from it, to his own mother, and then he buries the guy and saved the letter. And this was his job for about three days in a rainstorm, burying Union and Confederate dead. Now, but strategically it’s hugely important. But finally Grant was able to put Vicksburg, in the spring of 1863, under siege, mostly from the east, and it was especially under complete lockdown siege from May 22 to the first week of July, in which time the civilian population of Vicksburg that was left, and a roughly 30,000 garrison of the Confederate Army, began to starve. And that is, by the way folks, the most densely populated slave region anywhere in the South, and it is the escape of slaves now, by the hundreds and then thousands, into Grant’s lines, that forced his hand in the creation of numerous contraband camps all over northern Mississippi and Tennessee and even down the Mississippi. Quote: “Events have succeeded one another with disastrous rapidity."
527,history,hist-119,lecture-19,"Professor Blight uses Herman Melville’s poem “On the Slain Collegians” to introduce the horrifying slaughter of 1864. The architect of the strategy that would eventually lead to Union victory, but at a staggering human cost, was Ulysses S. Grant, brought East to assume control of all Union armies in 1864. Professor Blight narrates the campaigns of 1864, including the Battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, and the siege of Petersburg. While Robert E. Lee battled Grant to a stalemate in Virginia, however, William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union forces took Atlanta before beginning their March to the Sea, destroying Confederate morale and fighting power from the inside. Professor Blight closes his lecture with a description of the first Memorial Day, celebrated by African Americans in Charleston, SC 1865.","It used to be said that in the old wars fought by the Irish clans that they had an agreement. Herman Melville wrote a whole bunch of poems during the Civil War. The anguish of maternal hearts must search for balm divine. Now, on the other side, in Robert E. Lee, the South had without a question — we’ve said this before and there’s so much been written on this you can’t count it all — the South had a great general in Lee, a daring general. Sounds like a title of a porn movie or something but —  But she did the book from Lee’s voluminous letters. Lifetime officer, son of Light Horse Harry Lee of the American Revolution fame. He had a brother that was an even greater scoundrel. Or, only through his devotion and his maneuverability of huge numbers of men across difficult landscapes did the Confederacy survive as long as it did through 1864 in his struggle against Grant’s Army, which outnumbered him at times two to one, in 1864 and 1865. Now, the Campaign of 1864, the pivotal — in so many ways, decisive, despite the fact that it becomes a horrible stalemate — the decisive campaign of the Civil War in everyone’s hopes in the North, a campaign once again that would only be one summer, was launched in April and May of ‘64. They essentially just bumped into one another because there were only two roads that went North, South or East or West through this area. And yet what happened was, of course, Grant never intended to stop no matter what happened. He had the obvious advantage of manpower. He didn’t realize that Lee’s army on each flank had a river, and those rivers were pretty high, it was May/June, and there was no way to flank him. They sat down with him, they convinced him they could do it, and they did it. And the lines in some areas here were never more than 150 to 200 yards apart. Not bad, it’s one of the best parts of that movie actually. It was then that Sherman, based on this strategy of conquest, destruction of resources and war upon people, made the decision, really quite quickly, to launch his march to the sea. His order was put in the starkest of total war terms. William Lloyd Garrison was there from the North, the great abolitionist who wept uncontrollably when he heard a small black children’s choir sing .And the very night of that ceremony, which was the 14 of April, they held a banquet of a sort in a building that had a roof on it, back in Charleston, and that was the very night, of course, that Lincoln was assassinated at Ford’s Theater in Washington. Everybody marched all the way around the racetrack; as many as could fit got into the gravesite. African-Americans invented Memorial Day, in Charleston, South Carolina. The old oval of that racetrack is still there today."
528,history,hist-119,lecture-1,"Professor Blight offers an introduction to the course. He summarizes some of the course readings, and discusses the organization of the course. Professor Blight offers some thoughts on the nature of history and the study of history, before moving into a discussion of the reasons for Americans’ enduring fascination with the Civil War. The reasons include: the human passion for epics, Americans’ fondness for redemption narratives, the Civil War as a moment of “racial reckoning,” the fascination with loss and lost causes, interest in military history, and the search for the origins of the modern United States.","I’m going to try to write a little bigger from now on, and it’s been already suggested I use capital letters and maybe practice my printing a little better. I’m still taking the plastic off this one. A lot of real people in that book, and much of it — like so many other of Doctorow’s great works, like , if you’ve read , or others — much of the language, the dialog, is verbatim out of historical sources. Whole portions of it come directly out of Sherman’s memoirs, and then there are characters invented around it. This is a course at the end of the day about the causes and consequences, as well as the course, of this event. It’s not usually the passage you hear from the “I Have A Dream” speech. One hundred years later the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. If you’ll forgive me, it only takes me about ten seconds. It’s only a few generations ago when there really weren’t any bookstores to go to. Some of us just love stories and don’t care about the analysis — “oh, stop giving me all that interpretation, just tell me the good story again.” There are many, many ways to think about that. I’m going to take you through seven or eight possible answers to that in just a moment, almost like a list. And the suffering might be northern Unionists. I also like this little passage, to just put into your craw, about any History course, about any interpretation. But that’s actually where the surrender was signed that ended the Civil. Why do people want to read about it, re-enact it, go play it, go visit it? In the language used by both sides in this war, of purgings and cleansings. Every year at Antietam, in rural Maryland, on the anniversary of the battle, 17 of September, they put out illuminati, or the illuminaria, excuse me — no, no, whoa, that’s a slip — illuminaria, or the little candle lamps, all over the battlefield. Loss in war is sometimes more interesting. But you can also find expressions all over the culture, especially from African-Americans and abolitionists and some slaveholders of a great dread about the direction of the country. Thou holdest not the venture of thyself alone, not the Western continent alone."
529,history,hist-119,lecture-20,"This lecture begins with a central, if often overlooked, turning point in the Civil War–the re-election of Abraham Lincoln in 1864. Although the concerted efforts of northern Peace Democrats and a palpable war weariness among the electorate made Lincoln’s victory uncertain, timely Union victories in Atlanta and Mobile in September of 1864 secured Lincoln’s re-election in November. This lecture concludes Professor Blight’s section on the war, following Lee and Grant to Appomattox Courthouse, and describing the surrender of Confederate forces. The nature of Reconstruction and the future of the South, however, remained open questions in April of 1865.","We’re going to elect, that is re-elect, Lincoln in a moment, the election of 1864 being one of the, without a question, crucial turning points in the war, in a war that was so political. I’m going to actually recite a little piece, little bits, of what could be Whitman’s greatest poem, at least it in my view. And he’s trying to use the bird — go read this poem, read it three, four, and five times — he’s trying to use the warbling, the song sparrow, as a metaphor for all of America. “ But back up with me, back up with me into that last year of the war. Some of them truly wanted to sue for a negotiated peace, but they would always say they wanted a negotiated peace of the South that would still restore the Union. Many of them were quite explicitly for a negotiated peace that would not result in emancipation. But he went back home to Rochester, New York and he organized about fifteen or sixteen agents, by letter and telegram, in late August and the first week of September, all over the North. It still looks almost exactly as it looked in 1865. Lee dressed up in his finest golden sash. To the South, you can rest assured, the day they heard about Appomattox was the way it was for most Northerners about the day they heard of Lincoln’s assassination. Surely this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.” Three weeks ago when Barack Obama used the word “slave,” “slavery,” or “slaves,” seven times in that remarkable speech, it’s remarkable because it’s been altogether rare that presidents or presidential candidates have ever mouthed the word “slave” in American political rhetoric. And some of them are actually signaled in that Second Inaugural. Nativism will be put on the run, at least for awhile, quite awhile. It’s been taken out of its — it’s been unshucked from its shell, by war. I want to know particularly what the good chance is you proposed to give me. The folks here call her Mrs. Anderson, and the children, Millie Jane and Grundy, go to school and are learning. All right, now Reconstruction is, of course, that ten or eleven year period of American history that sometimes, too often — I don’t know how it was taught to you — but sometimes, too often we skirt through. But Reconstruction policy, of course, began during the war. ”That’s one approach, but that is not the approach of the leaders of the Congressional Republicans, some of whom would’ve wished for there to be some treason trials and executions, but short of that they want a Reconstruction that’s going to reshape the American polity, rewrite the U.S. Constitution, and remake Southern society. There is sobbing of the strong, And a pall upon the land; But the People in their weeping Bare an iron hand; Beware the People weeping When they bare the iron hand."
530,history,hist-119,lecture-21,"In this lecture, Professor Blight begins his engagement with Reconstruction. Reconstruction, Blight suggests, might best be understood as an extended referendum on the meaning of the Civil War. Even before the war’s end, various constituencies in the North attempted to control the shape of the post-war Reconstruction of the South. In late 1863, President Abraham Lincoln offered his lenient “Ten Percent Plan.” Six months later, Congressional Republicans concerned by Lincoln’s charity rallied behind the more radical provisions of the Wade-Davis Bill. Despite their struggle for control over Reconstruction, Congressional Radicals and President Lincoln managed to work together on two vital pieces of Reconstruction legislation in the first months of 1865–the 13th Amendment, which outlawed slavery in the United States, and the Freedmen’s Bureau bill.","Reconstruction is that period of American history that I think still — I know still — is short-shrifted in the ways people tend to learn American history in this society, for whatever the reasons. I do think most of you in the room can read it. If the Civil War and Reconstruction were a second founding — and I’ll put the “if” on that, although for the next three weeks I’m going to argue that — if it was a second founding, a second revolution of some kind, that second founding is in the Thirteenth, the Fourteenth, the Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution. It’s a museum full of lots of wax figures. Or finally put yet another way — and I wrote about this at too much length in a book called  — the challenge of Reconstruction, and it’s the challenge we’ve had ever since, is how do you do two profound things at the same time? His audience that day wanted to just hear about the glories of the ending of the war, and he gave them a little mini lecture on Reconstruction because it’s precisely what he was dealing with. But back to wartime, at least for a few minutes. The debate over Reconstruction, as it will play out through the next three years, four years, really five years, up to 1870/71, is the debate that ensued between Lincoln and his own party leadership in Congress, as early as late 1863. He wanted it done by executive authority. A president is never so powerful as in time of war. This is what they have to think about now. Would Reconstruction be a preservation of something old, or the creation of something truly new? He, number one, would pardon all ex-Confederates, with a certain list of exceptions. There was no mention, at that point, of any black suffrage. And the two of them led the response to Lincoln’s ideas on Reconstruction from the two different houses of Congress. He said not only did the Southern states secede from the Union, they should be reverted to the status of unorganized territories; or, even further he went, he said now they’re not only going to have to be put under territorial status, but they should be treated like a foreign nation that the United States has conquered, a conquered province of a foreign land. Okay Abe, but what are you committed to?” Formerly called the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, it passed Congress on the 3 of March, 1865, just a day before Lincoln’s Second Inaugural. I’ve often put this to major Lincoln scholars. What could send a better Unionist message to the border states than Andrew Johnson, the only Southern senator who doesn’t secede from his seat?Well, all was pretty well, at least until the inauguration. Andrew Johnson, unfortunately, was drunk at his inauguration as Vice-President of the United States."
531,history,hist-119,lecture-22,"Professor Blight continues his discussion of the political history of Reconstruction. The central figure in the early phase of Reconstruction was President Andrew Johnson. Under Johnson’s stewardship, southern whites held constitutional conventions throughout 1865, drafting new constitutions that outlawed slavery but changed little else. When the Republican-dominated U.S. Congress reassembled late in 1865, they put a stop to Johnson’s leniency and inaugurated Radical (or Congressional) Reconstruction, a process that resulted in the immediate passage of the Civil Rights bill and the Fourteenth Amendment, and the eventual passage of four Reconstruction Acts. The Congressional elections in 1866 and Johnson’s disastrous “Swing Around the Circle” speaking tour strengthened Radical control over Congress. Each step of the way, Johnson did everything he could to obstruct Congressional Reconstruction, setting the stage for his impeachment in 1868.","I was in a meeting some months ago of the New York Historical Society’s Board of Trustees; august, wonderful group of people. Now, Reconstruction is a classic story of — we’ve said this already — great change, great experimentation, change forced upon people in some ways — as we’ll see with the Fourteenth Amendment in a moment — and yet enough of a cadre of leadership accepted that challenge and rewrote the country you live in. He had a strong attachment to the American Union. He would accept the Thirteenth Amendment, the end of slavery, because that’s part of the verdict of the war, there wasn’t any way around that, but he never accepted the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, and he worked vehemently to destroy the Fourteenth Amendment, or at least he worked vehemently to urge states not to ratify it. Nobody who owned $20,000.00 — the planter class, in other words, was not going to get a pardon, no matter what they did during the war; if they were rich they weren’t going to be pardoned, well at least until they applied for it, and the application had to be personal to the President of the United States. And it was very tiny proportions in some places. Three or four of those laws are there in your reader; read them, with some care. There were all kinds of restrictive vagrancy laws passed; pass laws passed, where blacks could be at any given point in time, with or without a pass. And as they began to arrive in Washington, it was this kind of insolence on the part of ex-Confederates that in some ways began to stimulate what we will call Radical Reconstruction. Tremendous mythology has gone around that story that he wasn’t fed properly, that he was mistreated, that he got ill and wasn’t given medical attention, virtually all of which is nonsense. And just to show you the harbingers of reconciliation in the political culture, the people who paid his bail were all Northerners, some of them quite famous. What were the political attitudes of Southerners? They gave it a new life for another year. Congress would pass a law, whether it’s the Civil Rights Act, the renewal of the Freedmen’s Bureau, and numerous other things — eventually all four of the Reconstruction Acts in early ‘67 — and Johnson would veto them. But they were also here trying to head off, of course, the demands for compensation for loss of slave property, as a Confederate debt. The estimate is that between 1800 and 1860, the slave states in the South, depending on when you take the snapshot, received from twenty to thirty additional congressmen, in the House, because of the three-fifths clause; because three-fifths of black people were being counted for representation. Stevens would’ve had this amendment go further than it did, especially in Black Suffrage. But it had never been applied to all Americans. No Fourteenth Amendment, no Civil Rights Movement. In Memphis, about forty blacks were killed and over 200 wounded, whole neighborhoods destroyed; Congressional investigations launched. This was the state of chaos and reaction, already going on in the South. And between 1868 and 1871, the Klan and its many, many, many imitators will engage in a kind of violence-as-real-politics, in an attempt to take back control of the political South."
532,history,hist-119,lecture-23,"Professor Blight begins this lecture in Washington, where the passage of the first Reconstruction Act by Congressional Republicans radically altered the direction of Reconstruction. The Act invalidated the reconstituted Southern legislatures, establishing five military districts in the South and insisting upon black suffrage as a condition to readmission. The eventful year 1868 saw the impeachment of one president (Andrew Johnson) and the election of another (Ulysses S. Grant). Meanwhile, southern African Americans struggle to reap the promises of freedom in the face of economic disempowerment and a committed campaign of white supremacist violence.","There’s a simple question for you, what is the engine of history? This was actually an early Union League meeting, in 1866. All right, back to Washington, back to the politics, at least for a few minutes, and then I want to shift us south to this story of the on-the-ground economics of Reconstruction, especially this massive transformation of a slave labor economy into some kind of free labor economy that quickly evolves, of course — and you know this, at least the contours of it, from reading Foner — it evolves eventually, rather quickly, into a system of tenant farming and a system of sharecropping and a system ultimately of a kind of debt peonage. But in Washington, the political triumph of the Radical Republicans comes in that veto-proof Congress they produced in the fall elections of 1866. The authority to impeach, of course, rests with the House of Representatives. Now there are numerous theories, historical interpretations, about why Johnson was finally impeached by the Republicans. It’s really beautiful, awful, ugly stuff. And one of his chapters is, of course, about Andrew Johnson being persecuted by the Radical Republicans in Reconstruction. He would veto the Freedmen’s Bureau, they’d override the Freedmen’s Bureau and they’d put the budget in place, and he’d say, “Just go and try to enforce it.” In his State of the Union Message, December 1867 — this is after three attempts; three investigations of him have already been done by the House Judiciary Committee, and the House Judiciary Committee has brought possible impeachment articles to a vote and yet voted it down because they didn’t quite have any smoking guns yet. No independent government of any form has ever been successful in their hands. Stephens, Sumner, Wade and the host of the Republicans in Congress kept hearing this over and over and over, and finally they went after him. It was a memory-laden peace that was at stake. Now I want to just give you an example or two of just how racist this campaign was in 1868. A Georgia Democrat, who got himself elected to the U.S. Senate, named Benjamin Hill, said the South was now under the rule of a foreign power, driven by hate and determined to dishonor an unarmed people. Or take this example of a kind of a black bloody shirt. It was the weekly newspaper of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. And he put it into a kind of little parable. As someone once said, politics, it’s just war by other means, and there’s never a time when that is more true than 1868.The Ku Klux Klan came into its own in 1868. In the absence of slavery what did the freedmen — now think with me — what did the freedmen actually own? They wanted black people to remain, if not slaves in status, landless, dependent and stationary, as agricultural workers. We’ve learned a great deal, I think, from the First and the Second Reconstructions in American history — if we can refer to the Civil Rights Movement as the Second Reconstruction — we’ve learned a great deal about how political liberty can be achieved: the right to vote, right to hold office, serve on a jury, engage in the political culture, in spite of the hostility and the violence and intimidation."
533,history,hist-119,lecture-24,"This lecture opens with a discussion of the myriad moments at which historians have declared an “end” to Reconstruction, before shifting to the myth and reality of “Carpetbag rule” in the Reconstruction South. Popularized by Lost Cause apologists and biased historians, this myth suggests that the southern governments of the Reconstruction era were dominated by unscrupulous and criminal Yankees who relied on the ignorant black vote to rob and despoil the innocent South. The reality, of course, diverges widely from this image. Among other accomplishments, the Radical state governments that came into existence after 1868 made important gains in African-American rights and public education. Professor Blight closes the lecture with the passage of the 15th Amendment, the waning radicalism of the Republican party after 1870, and the rise of white political terrorism across the South.","Frederick Douglass gave a speech in 1875 that gives us a question that we might keep in mind right through the end of the course. And then there are those who argue, “Reconstruction now it really ended in 1873,” and there are reasons you might argue that; the horrifying Colfax Massacre in Louisiana on Easter Sunday, April 14, 1873, the largest domestic murder, collective mass murder in all of American history, until 9/11, and the following Supreme Court decision, based upon the investigation of that massacre; and I’m going to deal with Colfax next Tuesday. We are proud of our pupils and feel you will rejoice with us. They wanted some control over their economic lives. Now the story that set in about this, over the years, from the Lost Cause ideology of the late nineteenth century to the writings of the so-called Dunning School at the turn of the twentieth century and early twentieth century, based on the writings of William H. Dunning and his many, many students he trained at Columbia University, was this idea that what happened in the South now was essentially carpetbag rule, or rule by bayonet, or rule by blacks. The number of elective offices increased. There was more direct election, more direct control for people than the South had ever seen. This was the age of spoils and the kinds of corruption going on in southern state governments was no different than the kinds of corruption going on in many other places in the country. And they lasted seven, eight and nine years, in some ex-Confederate states, and they only lasted two, three, and four years in others. It actually is going to last all the way to 1890, on the books. In the Census of 1890 about 13,000 blacks in South Carolina owned a farm of some size, 4,000 of whom had purchased them through that Land Commission. There were five black mayors of Southern cities, for awhile. There were New Hampshirites who went to Mississippi because it was warm. And then there’s this other kind of Southerner, the white indigenous Southerner, the native born white Southerner, known to history, of course, as Scalawags, who joined the Republican Party, who became part of these Reconstruction regimes, who said give up the past, give up the old cause, and they often became the object of the ire and the hatred and the violence of white vigilante groups, as readily as anyone else. And he even for awhile commanded U.S. troops in Louisiana who tried to kill off the Klan. It doesn’t have a date on it, unfortunately. What happens now, what is already happening now, in the first Grant administration, by 1870, is what we might simply call — it’s the waning of Radicalism, it’s the waning of that civic vision, as Foner calls it in your book, of the Radical Republicans’ ideology. He said the Radical Republicans had an essential ideological vision. This is Ex-Colored man — he doesn’t have any other name — describing what he sees. “ The rope was removed and a chain brought and securely coiled around the victim and the stake. His eyes, bulging from their sockets, rolled from side to side, appealing in vain for help."
534,history,hist-119,lecture-25,"This lecture focuses on the role of white southern terrorist violence in brining about the end of Reconstruction. Professor Blight begins with an account the Colfax Massacre. Colfax, Louisiana was the sight of the largest mass murder in U.S. history, when a white mob killed dozens of African Americans in the April of 1873. Two Supreme Court decisions would do in the judicial realm what the Colfax Massacre had done in the political. On the same day as the Colfax Massacre, the Supreme Court offered a narrow reading of the 14th Amendment in the Slaughterhouse cases, signaling a judicial retreat from the radicalism of the early Reconstruction years. The Cruikshank case, two years later, would overturn the convictions of the only three men sentenced for their involvement in Colfax, and marked another step away from reconstruction. Professor Blight concludes with the Panic of 1873 and the seemingly innumerable political scandals of the Grant Administration, suggesting the manner in which these events encouraged northerners to tire of the Reconstruction experiment by the early 1870s.","The last book you’re reading in this course is by a great journalist, Nick Lemann. That day — I wouldn’t quite say freedom died on one day, that’s a little ahistorical, but so be it; that’s probably a publisher’s title more than an author’s title. But April 14, 1873 is in some ways one of those days we could call in American history a day of infamy. They put in a state-appointed inspector, and the white butchers of New Orleans were angry. He didn’t fight on the battlefield; he became Assistant Secretary of State in the Confederacy and served in that position, and other high-ranking official positions, in the Confederate national government throughout the Civil War. Rarely do we think of ourselves as citizens of states. By the way, the Red River Region of Central Louisiana was some of the richest soil in all of the South. And God only knows how he came by his sympathies and his beliefs in the rights of former slaves, but he became a Unionist during the Civil War in an area where — it was not healthy to be a Unionist in the Red River District. They built trenches all the way around the courthouse. The First Representatives of the Louisiana State Government, the Republican Louisiana State Government, arrived forty-eight hours after the massacre and recorded, one after another corpse, shot in the back of the head and then shot many more times, and then somebody’s mutilated, and they kept this — this is this kind of gruesome need to describe you find in these reports. Most of them now had been appointed by Lincoln or Grant. This was a thoroughly Republican Party Supreme Court. And he claimed to his dying day he was leaving adjudication to states, under sympathetic Republic governments. Yeah, but Justice Miller, what if a government’s no longer sympathetic, what if it’s run by Klansmen? Well there are many factors, and let me kind of run through them and then focus especially on the scandals, for a moment, and then on this larger question of violence; in case you haven’t heard enough about violence. Although he did have this idea that the presidency ought to be — especially in these crisis years, with the tremendous bitterness, bloody shirt tensions after the Civil War; and after all, he’s the general that won the war and obliterated Virginia — that the president ought to be now just basically a caretaker, ought to have as few opinions as possible; a caretaker presidency, not so much a leader as a unifier. And then Grant’s treasury secretary, George Boutwell, got involved. It was really a cartel, what we in modern times would call the creation of a cartel. It doesn’t say anything about human affairs. But the Radical Republican ideology at least set in motion a tradition. And finally they passed what was called the Ku Klux Klan Act; April 20, 1871."
535,history,hist-119,lecture-26,"Having dealt with the role of violence and the Supreme Court in bringing about the end of Reconstruction in his last lecture, Professor Blight now turns to the role of national electoral politics, focusing in particular on the off-year Congressional election of 1874 and the Presidential election of 1876. 1874 saw the return of the Democrats to majority status in the Senate and the House of Representatives, as voters sick of corruption and hurt by the Panic of 1873 fled the Republicans in droves. According to many historians, the contested election of 1876, and the “Compromise of 1877,” which followed it, marked the official end of Reconstruction. After an election tainted by fraud and violence, Republicans and Democrats brokered a deal by which Republican Rutherford B. Hayes took the White House in exchange for restoration of “home rule” for the South.","In his little novel , William Faulkner has a line he puts in the mouth of one of his characters. It’s one of the best single sentence descriptive explanations of what happened to the legacy and memory of all these events I’ve ever read. Just listen to how conclusive that is — it’s over folks. There is no chance or hope of healthy politics until we do get rid of it. All of this national self-congratulation ignored or masked some of the less admiral features of American life. It housed collections of needlework and weaving and demonstrations of power looms. There was a bale of Benjamin Montgomery’s cotton, from Davis Bend, Mississippi, which won an agricultural medal at the exposition, beating out cotton from all over the South and from Brazil and from Egypt and the Fiji Islands and other places, but no mention whatsoever made of the recent violent overthrow of reconstruction in Mississippi. I said this at the beginning of our whole unit on Reconstruction, the North and the South had to come back together. They went from a Republican majority of 110 overnight to a Democratic Party majority of sixty. In the wake of the election there were 109 Republicans left and there were 169 Democrats. And it upset patterns, the election did, in state after state after state, that were two, at least two decades old, in American political culture. It was a country coming to a halt and changing front. A little hyperbole, but making their case. In Vicksburg, Mississippi, the following summer — and there’s actually, there’s a bit about this in Nick Lemann’s book, which you’re reading, and I’m sparing you any lecturing about what happened in Mississippi in 1875 because that’s what Lemann’s book is all about, the so-called Shotgun Policy, the violent overthrow of Reconstruction by the white Democratic Party in Mississippi. Veni Vidi blamed it on national reconciliation. He will promise something for almost everyone, depending on where he went, in the vaguest possible terms, and he will inspire, once again, that cynical SOB, Henry Adams, for one of the best descriptions I’ve ever read of Rutherford Hayes. Now what happened, of course, is that Tilden carried all of — a map here may be useful — Tilden — I don’t know how well you can see that but at least you see the contours of it — Tilden, the Democrat, carried all of the solid South except — now solid Democratic South — except three states, the three states remaining under teetering Republican regimes, Louisiana, South Carolina and Florida. If you like, in terms of numbers, he’s the Al Gore of the 1876 election, he won the popular vote, of the votes cast. It isn’t going to be a lot different here, although the Supreme Court will have only a very limited role. There would be five Republicans, five Democrats, and five Supreme Court Justices — fifteen people. He’ll leave on May 17 for the greatest tour any American ever made of Planet Earth — that’s another story. He was privately inaugurated, quietly in the East Room of the White House. But, he drew upon, at the end of that speech, he drew upon one of the most revolutionary moments in the Bible, to try to keep a certain degree of hope alive about what had at least been started."
536,history,hist-119,lecture-27,"Professor Blight finishes his lecture series with a discussion of the legacies of the Civil War. Since the nineteenth century, Blight suggests, there have been three predominant strains of Civil War memory, which Blight defines as reconciliationist, white supremacist, and emancipationist. The war has retained a political currency throughout the years, and the ability to control the memory of the Civil War has been, and continues to be, hotly contested.","I’m going to talk for a few minutes about this memory question. Horwitz, a great journalist, did a travel book all over the South and tried to come to some grips and understanding of many things, but particularly of Civil War buffs and Civil War enthusiasm — of why this event endures so much in our popular culture. Let me attempt a definition, some attempt. It can be simply another word for historical memory, of how we remember things, and then how we use them. It’s a habit, it’s a point of view and it’s a set of assumptions. Slavery was gone, anger at its loss had no end. Forty percent of all Southern livestock were dead at the end of the war. At the very end of the essay Catton redeemed himself a bit. Now that was probably — given how closely Catton knew Lincoln, loved Lincoln — that was probably a riff on Lincoln’s use of the word ‘somehow’ in the Second Inaugural, where Lincoln says, “somehow, all knew the war was about slavery.” Now, I remember rising up from that thinking well I just lost another hero. Among all the possible lessons of our Civil War,” wrote Robert Penn Warren, “is the realization” — his words — “that slavery looms up mountainously in the story and cannot be talked away.” If you want to ask what was the biggest success in the long struggle over Civil War memory, it was the success of the Lost Cause ideology in selling themselves to northerners who bought in and said, “yes, the nation has finally triumphed over the mistake of Reconstruction.” You’ve read about the Gettysburg Reunion in this essay of mine; I won’t even go into that, the biggest of all the Blue-Grey Reunions, which became the Jim Crow Reunion by 1913. And literally, on the last two pages, she has two Confederate soldiers, in their rags, half- starved, in conversation. Anyway, in 1900 the Blue-Grey was in Atlanta, and during the major speeches at that reunion the Commander of the GAR, the Grand Army of the Republic, the big Northern veterans’ organization, was a guy named Shaw from Massachusetts; no relation to Robert Gould Shaw of the famous 54 Mass. And in his speech he lectured the Confederate veterans — this guy had a lot of New England chutzpah — he lectured them about their efforts to control school textbooks; which by the way all veterans’ organizations were absolutely doing. John B. Gordon had been a Confederate General. I never will be ready to have my children taught that I was ever wrong, or that the cause of my people was unjust and unholy. And theater productions, plays, about the Civil War, especially with some kind of reconciliationist theme, became wildly popular by the 1890s. I want to get to our review; yes I am getting to our review. There’s something human about that, that we can’t quite resist. At age about ten her mother got cancer, lost her job."
537,history,hist-119,lecture-2,"Professor Blight offers a number of approaches to the question of southern distinctiveness. The lecture offers a survey of that manner in which commentators–American, foreign, northern, and southern–have sought to make sense of the nature of southern society and southern history. The lecture analyzes the society and culture of the Old South, with special emphasis on the aspects of southern life that made the region distinct from the antebellum North. The most lasting and influential sources of Old South distinctiveness, Blight suggests, were that society’s anti-modernism, its emphasis on honor, and the booming slave economy that developed in the South from the 1820s to the 1860s.","We’re going to take up this question initially of — it’s an old, old, old American question — how peculiar, or distinctive, or different is the American South? The South, of course, is many, many, many things and many, many, many peoples. Oh, and they love violence and football and stockcar racing, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Loss always, I think, almost always, especially in modern history, has led to longer, deeper, troubled memories. Why is history and memory sometimes a deep family matter, to Southerners? Whereas it isn’t necessarily to Northerners, or so it seems. The latest was just found another five years or so. But let’s go back to the Old South, this Old South that got the United States in so much trouble. The North and the South had roughly, as the Northern and Southern states, the Free states and Slave states, had roughly the same geographic size. So it isn’t just States’ Rights that’s distinctively Southern. You could argue that both sides had essentially the same kind of oligarchies. And we’d been warned about New Englanders and all that. But we delivered the baked goods and said, “Hi, how are you? Noah Webster, of the great dictionary fame, said famously, “Oh New England, how superior are thy habits in morals, literature, civility and industry.” It was a society that eventually developed a disdain for what they perceived as the corruptions of modern commercialism. Southern slaveholding leadership, in particular, were very suspicious of the spread of literacy. We so long had this game of sort of always looking for the central theme of Southern history, the central theme of the South. Thomas Sutpen is that guy who arrives out in Alabama with a group of Haitian slaves with him. That’s another one of those sentences by Faulkner that sort of captured this spirit of Alabama Fever, as it was called, in the 1820s and ’30s, and Mississippi Fever in the 1830s, Louisiana/Texas Fever by the 18 — well Louisiana Fever is even earlier — but Texas Fever by the 1840s. If you’re an oil rich country today, as long as that oil lasts, you got the world kind of at your knees. And you will find, as we will in the next few weeks, the Southern political power by the 1850s and 1860s is really no longer in Virginia, or even South Carolina, it’s out in the Mississippi Valley. That means two-thirds did not, of course. Now I’ll pick up with this next Tuesday; it’s a perfect transition into the pro-slavery argument an the southern worldview."
538,history,hist-119,lecture-3,"Professor Blight lectures on southern slavery. He makes a case for viewing the U.S. South as one of the five true “slave societies” in world history. He discusses the internal slave trade that moved thousands of slaves from the eastern seaboard to the cotton states of the Southwest between 1820 and 1860. Professor Blight then sketches the contents of the pro-slavery argument, including its biblical, historical, economic, cynical, and utopian aspects.","In a speech before the Virginia Secession Convention, in 1861, in late April, in the wake of the firing on Fort Sumter, the newly elected — sort of appointed — Vice-President of the Confederacy, Alexander H. Stephens, gave a speech that became quickly known to history as his “Cornerstone Speech.” Subordination to the white man is his normal condition. Because one of the critiques that slavery allowed pro-slavery writers, ultimately, to make, was a critique of a certain kind of capitalism, the greedy, grinding, aggressive, malicious kind of capitalism they believed the North embodied. Not entirely accurate about that either, from what we now know about the profitability of slavery and the profitability of the cotton crop. ”Now, in the South what developed — and let’s define it at least quickly — what developed was one of the world’s handful of true slave societies. Essentially, it means any society where slave labor — where the definition of labor, where the definition of the relationship between ownership and labor — is defined by slavery. But the five great slave societies were those five. That’s always open to debate, exactly when the South became a slave society. Their ads were in the newspapers every day. He is a house-servant, first-rate cook, and splendid carriage driver. Now, the best way to begin to understand pro-slavery ideology, whether we’re in the early period of its defense in the 1820s — actually, a quite virulent defense of slavery begins early, it isn’t something that just sprung from Southern pens in the 1850s during all this expansion, it comes very early. Although a lot of Abolitionists had their struggles with this one too. Now, what would you do if your parents told you that? You will say that man cannot hold property in man. Could I do more for the ultimate good of the slave population by holding or emancipating what I own? At the end of the day that’s where Alexander H. Stephens went, with his Cornerstone Speech in 1861. He lived in New Orleans, he was eccentric as hell. He believed in a strong central state, which was a real departure for him from the rest of the pro-slavery writers. He wanted a strong central government to regulate everything. His writings are just replete with his fears about hygiene, that if white and black people touched or if they came together the whites would be soiled, and that any kind of intermixing of the races was to destroy ultimately the intellect, the ability, the capacity of a master race. It wasn’t just a profitable financial institution."
539,history,hist-119,lecture-4,"Having finished with slavery and the pro-slavery argument, Professor Blight heads North today. The majority of the lecture deals with the rise of the Market Revolution in the North, in the 1820s, 1830s, and 1840s. Blight first describes the causes of the Market Revolution–the rise of capital, a transportation revolution–and then moves to its effects on the culture and consciousness of antebellum northerners. Among these effects were a riotous optimism mixed with a deep-rooted fear of change, an embrace of the notions of progress and Manifest Destiny, and the intensification of the divides between North and South.","The other day I laid a — well, in part I laid a list of pro-slavery arguments on you, and a lot of quotations to give you a sense of the depth and breadth of pro-slavery ideology, and I didn’t want to leave that entirely without tying up a knot or two. And it was a work on the desks of most secessionists. And by means I don’t entirely understand, Uriah Parmelee, in the spring of 1861, was an Abolitionist. A lot of chutzpah in that passage; he hasn’t seen any real war yet. Since the 1 of January it has become more and more evident to my mind that the war is henceforth to be conducted upon a different basis. If you can come to understand a Uriah Parmelee — or better yet, if you can come to understand young, white, northern, Yankee, Anglo-Saxon, Protestants, who often were very contemptuous of Irish immigrants, and even more contemptuous of black Americans, who nevertheless believed the War of 1861 had to be fought, and ultimately came even to support the destruction of slavery — if you can understand why those Northern Yankees get to that point, you really will understand the Civil War. But this Market Revolution is not reported in that newspaper, I would venture. And some fortunes will begin to be made in simple financial speculation. The workplace would become less personal, bigger, uncontrollable. Everybody had to work, and usually outside of whatever was home. And by the way, we, the people of progress, are rooted in those principles of the Declaration of Independence” — which are written down essentially as creeds — “and, oh and by the way, we have a written Constitution — we actually wrote it down, we have a Bill of Rights where we declare these things on paper, unlike the Brits.” 1850s Chicago, which was already by the 1850s the railroad capital of North America? He said Americans would always build a house but then move before they put a roof on it. But railroads revolutionized an American sense of time, their ability to travel. It also made the first multi-millionaires, the first massive fortunes, and it became the first great example of the deep relationship in the nineteenth century — back in our heyday of laisser-faire government, ho-ho — of a relationship between the Federal government and business. But Manifest Destiny was in some ways the fuel of the American imagination. They throw all kinds of old books, great old books, onto the bonfire. I’ve always found that kind of research rather boring, but I think he had a point. We’ve probably had four major periods in American history of — there’s one other picture I wanted to put up. And the New Deal brought a fundamental new set of approaches, ideas, which we’re still debating today; it’s all over our political culture whether it’s named or not. And we’ve been living the history of how to reform the industrializing process, and now the post-industrializing process, ever since our first market revolution — we’re still living it."
540,history,hist-119,lecture-5,"Professor Blight discusses the rise of abolitionism. Blight begins with an introduction to the genre of slave narratives, with particular attention to Frederick Douglass’ 1845 narrative. The lecture then moves on to discuss the culture in which antebellum reform grew–the factors that encouraged its growth, as well as those that retarded it. Professor Blight then describes the movement towards radical abolitionism, stopping briefly on colonization and gradualism before introducing the character and ideology of William Lloyd Garrison.","In some ways, the greatest witnesses — there are many, many witnesses of the coming of the Civil War — what caused it, what’s percolating from beneath the society of the South, we’ve looked at, and the society of the North — and in so many ways, of course, the greatest witnesses — and their stories have only been with us, in a serious, robust way, for the past couple of decades or so, a few decades — are those of the slaves themselves. You move merrily before the gentle gale and I sadly before the bloody whip. Language itself to a former slave who could write was a form of liberation. Sometimes it was in utopian experiments and communities. Now he may be right or wrong about this, you can decide. “ But that revolution had at least a twofold legacy. On the one hand, it was an event that really ushered those great Enlightenment ideas into the world that an anti-slavery impulse in America is going to draw upon, constantly. Two, anybody trying to work against slavery, even in the most gradual, modest ways, by the 1820s and the 1830s, has got to bump his head right into what we might simply call the sanctity of the U.S. Constitution. Now, Garrison’s going to call it a covenant with death, a deal with the devil, because of its complicities in slavery. This thing had congressional funding at first. They would be asked, never coerced, was the theory of the original Colonization Society. Liberia today, as you may know, has been through a vicious, horrifying Civil War. Gradual plans had been used, for example, in states like Connecticut. And if you’d been inspired by Charles Grandison Finney out in Oberlin, Ohio, or — as Theodore Weld had — or a number of other ministers across the North, that it was your duty to go save souls, it was only one step further — and Finney told them that — to save society as well. So don’t worry if I don’t quite get there. Garrison was by no means the whole Abolition movement, by any means. He would cease publishing it in December 1865; about nine months after the end of the Civil War, he ceased publication of in the week after the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. He went down to Baltimore, Maryland — here I go, I’m going to talk too much about Garrison, but that’s the way it goes — he went down to Baltimore and he worked with an anti-slavery paper there called , published by a guy named Benjamin Lundy, in Baltimore, a slave state. The guy sued him, he was convicted and he spent about nine months in jail, which for Garrison was pride. Now, if you want to understand William Lloyd Garrison, you have to understand through his ideas — and I’ll just list them for you with the briefest explanation. His third principle was anti-clericalism or opposition to what he saw as the hypocrisy and corruption of the American churches. But beneath all of this, the fugitives kept coming."
541,history,hist-119,lecture-6,"In this lecture, Professor Blight discusses some of the conflicts, controversies, and compromises that led up to the Civil War. After analyzing Frederick Douglass’s 1852 Fourth of July speech and the inherent conflict between American slavery and American freedom, the lecture moves into a lengthy discussion of the war with Mexico in the 1840s. Professor Blight explains why northerners and southerners made “such a fuss” over the issue of slavery’s expansion into the western territories. The lecture ends with the crisis over California’s admission to statehood and the Compromise of 1850.","If you haven’t noticed, at the back of my edition of Douglass’s narrative, which is the one I’m hoping you are using — . If you’ve never read it, you should read it. And on the 4 of July, amidst his friends in Rochester, New York, he’s invited to give the 4 of July oration. He just makes them feel good about the founders. If I forget thee O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning, if I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.” That was Douglass’s — and he did it hundreds of times elsewhere — it was Douglass’s most brilliant expression of — or critique of — this American hypocrisy about freedom in a land of slavery. James G. Birney who had been born in Alabama, a former slaveholder who moves north and becomes an abolitionist. Anyway, the Rio Grande was never accepted as the border by Mexico; but that’s never stopped wars of conquest before, and why would it then?Now, just to give you a bigger sense of this story. James K. Polk, the Democrat, a kind of hard money successor to Andrew Jackson, avid expansionist and a slave-owning cotton planter from Tennessee, got elected President. They didn’t cause a lot of ruckus, but they existed. War fever broke out all over the country. This was going to be an adventurous war, it was going to be quick. By the end of 1846, the U.S. had established dominion over the southern half of California, which Mexico also claimed. There are those arguing now that in some ways, 1848 should be as important a turning point year in American history as it is in Europe, because of the great democratic/republican revolutions in Europe. They favored non-extension on constitutional grounds. Now, in large swaths of land, mind you, that could become more than two states. One of the things that southern statesmen feared the most — and I cannot stress enough, because it’s going to be right there at the heart of their secession debates in 1860 — is they feared what they kept calling now this — it’s more than a theory to them — this theory of a shrinking south. There is a certain element of honor at stake here, in the South, about slavery. The first plan — these are all on your outline if you could see it earlier — you want that back up? The first we call the Wilmot Proviso, for good reason — it’s named for David Wilmot, a young Democratic Party Representative in the House of Representatives, who in 1846 got up in the midst of the Mexican War — this is a Democrat now and not a Whig or a Free Soiler. The language was borrowed from the Northwest Ordinance. But it did not pass the Senate where the Slave states still have parity. They were created first in Massachusetts and they gave us Charles Sumner, among others; a group of abolitionist Whigs who broke with the Whig party now and would never go back, a harbinger of the ultimate death, within the next four years, of the Whig Party."
542,history,hist-119,lecture-7,"Professor Blight narrates some of the important political crises of the 1850s. The lecture begins with an account of the Compromise of 1850, the swan song of the great congressional triumvirate–Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun. The lecture then describes northern opposition to the Fugitive Slave Act passed as part of the Compromise, and the publication of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s classic  in 1852. Professor Blight then introduces the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, the most pivotal political event of the decade, and the catalyst for the birth of the Republican party.","I left you the other day with Henry Clay sloshing down some brandy on a late night in mid-January 1850, to try to come up with ways of solving the great political challenges they faced between the sections and over the expansion of slavery. And in it, Calhoun said many things, warning the country what the South might do, or at least the Deep South might do. That’s the question in the 1850s: can compromise, some kind of coalition and consensus around this question of slavery’s future — future in the West, future in the American political culture, future within the Constitution — can some kind of center hold?Now, Clay invited Daniel Webster to deal with this because Webster’s obviously the most — at that point in time Daniel Webster was the most famous Northern Whig politician. Clay of Kentucky, slave-holder — he owned about 60 people — hemp plantation farmer, original founder of the American Colonization Society, a border state political titan, with great influence in the Congress, pulls in Webster and says, “Daniel, we got to save the union, because look what Calhoun and company in the Deep South are threatening. I mentioned the other day that when Clay introduced his five measures, which were known first as the Clay Measures and then as the Compromise Measures, he stood up in the Senate, with great theater, and held a piece of what he said was George Washington’s coffin. They didn’t have a clue what it really was; didn’t matter. It doesn’t quite show it on this map properly, but the other day you remember the map of Texas — the boundaries of Texas had never been determined — to the Mexicans, much less to the Americans. It came at a huge price for his own career. Two measures Southerners would really like. He was really the parliamentary manager in the midst of the debates from March into the summer of 1850. And that night they spirited Shadrach off to Concord, Massachusetts where the descendents of abolitionists to this day like to argue which house he stayed in, and then off across Route 2, across northern Massachusetts and on up into Canada where Shadrach remained the rest of his life as a grocer in Montreal. And there were many, many other fugitive slave rescues now. It was sometimes now a matter of gun violence. But in some celebrated cases they weren’t. He too was working in — actually a store at one point, in a coffee shop at another point. And on the day Anthony Burns was marched — he was convicted — marched from the jail down to the wharf and put on a ship back to slavery in Virginia, the abolitionist community, black and white, of Boston and all of Massachusetts, gathered in Boston. Now, the problem was, Southerners wanted one thing out of this and a lot of Northerners wanted another thing. But, at the end of the day, sometimes there are three principles in play. Would American pragmatism continue to solve this one? It was silent about the old Missouri Compromise Line. It may seem a bit odd to us today that Americans could care this much about what was to be done to Nebraska,  or for that matter with Kansas."
543,history,hist-119,lecture-8,"Professor Blight continues his march through the political events of the 1850s. He continues his description of the aftermath of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, describing the guerilla war that reigned in the territory of Kansas for much of 1856. The lecture continues, describing the caning of Senator Charles Sumner on the floor of the US Senate and the birth of the Republican party. The lecture concludes with the near-victory of Republican candidate John C. Fremont in the presidential election of 1856, and the passage of the Dred Scott decision in 1857.","On the 4 of July, 1854, in an outdoor park in Framingham, Massachusetts, which is fifteen, twenty miles west of Boston, William Lloyd Garrison and the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society built a stage. It was a template, it was an assumption; not unlike you could name certain great resolutions or assumptions that became almost standard parts of American political culture, perhaps in your lifetime, certainly in my lifetime. It passed the House of Representatives 113 to 110, in a highly sectionalized vote. This is a poster, one of hundreds, thousands of posters from 1854 calling for a meeting. David Wilmot, the author of the Wilmot Proviso, you’ll remember from a week ago, that Pennsylvania Democrat who launched this idea during the debates on the Mexican War that said in any state formed from a territory gained from the Mexican War slavery shall never exist, the basic free soil position. In 1854, David Wilmot became a Republican. They’re forming it around a few key ideas. A fear of concentrated power, the defense of the individual, the small man. After the fall elections of 1854 there were only twenty-five left. And in that same year of 1854, this Nativist Party — they called themselves the American Party — a party that stood essentially for trying to stop Catholic — mainly Catholic — immigration into the United States. This was the moment of course — I mean look around today, we’ve got a huge debate going on about immigration and I won’t go into that — but you can see how it’s clustering in parts of our political culture — heighten that six times over to the early 1850s. I will come back to John Brown later, next week in fact. John Brown, a genuine, radical, deeply religious Old Testament abolitionist who went to Kansas, make no mistake, to make Kansas free and to kill slaveholders if necessary, in what he believed was a justifiable war. In the audience that day, sitting up in the balcony, was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives named Preston Brooks who was the nephew of Senator Butler. We will return to John Brown’s exploits next week. This had never happened in American history till then, it’s never happened since, a new third party had come so close to winning. They took a staunch stand about slavery expansion. The Democratic Party was still a national party. And Walker came back to Washington, urged his own president, who had appointed him, to not support this Lecompton Constitution. Emerson brought him back to Missouri in 1838 and through an intricate series of events for the next five to six years — not the least of which was Missouri is a very divided place, especially St. Louis — a group of anti-slavery folk gathered around Dred Scott and tried to help him sue for his freedom. Then, again with the help of an anti-slavery group, and even his own owner, believe it or not, they pushed this appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court."
544,history,hist-119,lecture-9,"Professor Blight narrates the momentous events of 1857, 1858, and 1859. The lecture opens with an analysis of the famous Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858. Next, Blight analyzes the Dred Scott decision and discusses what it meant for northerners–particularly African Americans–to live in “the land of the Dred Scott decision.” The lecture then shifts to John Brown. Professor Blight begins by discussing the way that John Brown has been remembered in art and literature, and then offers a summary of Brown’s life, closing with his raid on Harpers Ferry in October of 1859.","On a morning in the second week of March, 1857, Americans grew up living — they didn’t all quite understand it yet — but they grew up living in the land of the Dred Scott decision. And we’re going to discuss mostly today the story of one abolitionist; you could say the most famous abolitionist, certainly the most notorious American abolitionist, John Brown. Let anyone who doubts carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination, piece of machinery so to speak” — and here he’s arguing the slave-power conspiracy, without naming it — “compounded of the Nebraska doctrine and the Dred Scott decision, let him consider not only what work the machinery is adapted to do and how” — the machinery — “and how well adapted. Montgomery Blair and George Ticknor Curtis for Scott. It destroyed almost any conception now of consensus or compromise. Abraham Lincoln of Illinois, got his own racial problems, but a much more advanced sort of anti-slavery thinker, but still a moderate — he didn’t like abolitionists, he’d never been a member of an Abolitionist Society and never would be — believed there were Constitutional restraints on what Congress could actually do about slavery. And, of course, they’re right about that. There were no controls on banks in these years. And so typical of Douglass’s brilliance as an orator, he started to discuss how he saw fear on the horizon, and trouble and dread on the horizon, and he said he saw what he called “the manifold discouragements of my people everywhere I go.” Well, John Brown was born in Connecticut, Torrington to be exact, and just a ways up the road. There were remnants of slaves still traversing the north in the eighteen-teens. Probably what sustained him — and we know a good deal about this — was his religion, his faith, his theology if you want. He was a kind of orthodox nineteenth century Calvinist. He believed in an Old Testament kind of justice, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Five of Brown’s sons went west to Kansas, in late 1854 and early 1855. And then he called a convention in May 1858, in Canada, Chatham, Ontario, to which he invited abolitionists now, black and white, and it was to be a recruiting convention to recruit the men who would become part of his abolitionist army. And then he engaged in an eighty-two day wintertime trek of over 1000 miles with these eleven freed slaves, from Kansas north into Nebraska, then into Iowa, into Grinnell, Iowa, by the way also settled by New England abolitionists. So, lest we think this guy was only a lunatic — this was the real thing, he’d freed some slaves, and he had carted them all across the northern states, in the dead of winter, to their freedom. If you know anything about the English Civil War and the Puritan armies, it makes sense; it was based on something. Dangerfield Newby had a letter in his pocket from his wife, in Virginia, when he died at Harpers Ferry. He did free about a dozen slaves in the surrounding countryside, brought them into the old Fire Engine House of the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, hid out. And the news sprung across the country like news had never spread in the United States, partly because John Brown’s first major strategic mistake, or tactical mistake, was that the Manakosie Railroad came through Harpers Ferry right as he was entering the town. And in November 1859 he would get the most famous, sensational trial that the United States had ever seen."
545,history,hist-202,lecture-10,"Collective violence, in the form of popular protest, was one of the principal ways in which people resisted the expansion of capitalism and the state throughout the nineteenth century. The nature of this protest can be charted through three different, but related examples: grain riots across Europe in the first half of the century, the mythical figure of Captain Swing in England, and the Demoiselles of the Ariège in France. While these movements were ultimately repressed by the forces of capital and state power, they represented an attempt on the part of working people, the “remainders” of history, to impose an idea of popular justice.","I’m going to talk about some of my favorite people today. If one of the themes of the course and of any course, really, I suppose, that deals with the modern world experience, especially in this day of globalization, is the dynamic duo of capitalism or large-scale economic change and the state, you’re going to see that today in some of the folks that I’m talking about. The civil governor intervened to put down the rising, but the rebels overwhelmed him and attacked the chiefs of his forces. What’s going on here?Popular protest is a way of finding out what’s going on when you look at all this stuff. They see the stagecoaches, the , the wagons carting the grain away and they stop it. You’ve got the Guarda Civila in Spain, or you’ve got various police in the Italian estates, or you’ve got the tough, hardened Berlin police, or the Prussian army, or you’ve got the  or  , as they called them in the eighteenth century, or the  in the nineteenth century. They’re waiting until the price of grain even goes higher. Again, France is the most studied, but it disappears earlier in Britain. There are protests against the high cost of food. And, so, if you look at what people protest over, we can see this big economic change. Then we’ve got modern protest and more strikes and all that.” 1829 was an awful economic year everywhere in Europe. Because the big fish had eaten the smaller fish. They were the smaller farmers who couldn’t afford the big-time threshing machines, and they thought, “Maybe if they burn the machines of my ravenous neighbor, that wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.” Tens of thousands of people are on the road. The capital is Foix, but that’s in the plain, kind of. But the Pyrenees have many forests, many mountains. In Oregon, where I’m from, logging was a good way to make money. What they want is they want the government to restore their rights in the forest. The Forest Code of 1827 is evermore in use and you can’t have access to the forest.” The three or four days you could mock the judge who handed out unfair sentences. So, Jean, the lieutenant of the demoiselles, represents justice and this kind of acting out of this enraged carnival. The demoiselles, like Captain Swing, like these grain rioters in all of these countries, in Spain, in Britain, in Prussia, everywhere, these are the remnants of what people viewed as a traditional way of doing things that at least was infused with a sense of the proper, a sense of popular justice."
546,history,hist-202,lecture-11,"Revolutions occur when a critical mass of people come together to make specific demands upon their government. They invariably involve an increase in popular involvement in the political process. One of the central questions concerning 1848, a year in which almost every major European nation faced a revolutionary upsurge, is why England did not have its own revolution despite the existence of social tensions. Two principal reasons account for this fact: first, the success of reformist political measures, and the existence of a non-violent Chartist movement; second, the elaboration of a British self-identity founded upon a notion of respectability. This latter process took place in opposition to Britain’s cultural Other, Ireland, and its aftereffects can be seen in Anglo-Irish relations well into the twentieth century.","Today, what I want to do is talk about the revolutions of 1848. If you think about what you know about the French Revolution in this context, hopefully it will make some sense. In the 1960s many social scientists, not all, believed that revolutions came when pressure builds up and you’ve got intellectuals bailing out, leaving the regime. What happens is that in the case of 1848, or in the case of the other ones that I’ve mentioned, is that there is a seizure of power by a group who have come together because they oppose the policies of the government in power. In the case of France, people want the monarchy, the Bourbons, that is the legitimists who were chased out in 1830. You’ve got all these political clubs, just as in 1848. Over the long run, the costs to Europe of that fact would be, in retrospect, given what happens in the twentieth century, which is the one that follows the nineteenth, would be one thing that historians would go back and say very obvious things, sort of clichés like, “Well, in 1848 history in Germany reached its turning point and failed to turn.” That we’re going to come back to, but I can’t do that now. Although the revolutions of 1848 failed — and you should read about that, please do; I love this stuff, talking about this — the political legacies that they left are extremely important. In 1884 they pass another one that lets almost everybody in except for, I think, domestic servants and maybe rural proletarians. The self-image, the self-identity of the freeborn Englishman, tracing more or less, at least in the imaginary, antecedents back to June 15, 1215 at Runnymede near London. They are a minority within the Chartist movement. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, who had not yet returned to France, he was one of those who was actually deputized as a sheriff. They get those file cabinets ready to barricade the door. There is no revolution in Britain in 1848. All of these Irish are going to London, also. These Irish immigrants to the United States were the most militant, arguably, within the Irish political movement for independence. They were ending up in London living with other Irishmen, which is not surprising, maintaining these kinds of patterns by county, Cork, and all this. He tries to stop the Easter Insurrection. They are living in London in even bigger numbers."
547,history,hist-202,lecture-12,"The nineteenth century witnessed an unprecedented degree of urbanization, an increase in urban population growth relative to population growth generally. One of the chief consequences of this growth was class segregation, as the bourgeoisie and upper classes were forced to inhabit the same confined space as workers. Significantly, this had opposed effects in Europe, where the working classes typically inhabit the periphery of cities, and the United States, where they are most often in the city center itself. The growth of cities was accompanied by a high-pitched rhetoric of disease and decay, as the perceived hygienic problems of concentrated urban populations were extrapolated to refer to the city itself as a biological organism. The Baron Haussmann’s reconstruction of Paris under the Second Empire is a classic example of the intertwinement of urban development, capitalism and state power.","Today, I want to do the impossible and talk about urbanization and urban growth in fifty minutes. In doing so, I want to emphasize a couple points. People in France couldn’t get over that, the idea of wealthy people living in the suburbs as opposed to poor people living in the suburbs in Europe. Depending on what you define as urban, there’s a remarkable increase in the urban population in the nineteenth century. The other thing is in versus out migration. Women lived and still live longer than men. The church, which obviously opposes infanticide and obviously opposes abortion in the nineteenth century, what they do is they finally agree to put in these little things called tours, T-O-U-R-S.It’s an awful example to give and it comes out of an institution that no longer exists, Machine City, but anyplace that you have those kind of machines and you put money in and you hope that the window is going to turn around and actually give you your M&Ms. They encouraged young women, usually unmarried or uncoupled women, to abandon their babies instead of exposing them and having them die. In the case of Berlin, northern Germans from Brandenburg or Pomerania and many Poles were moving into Berlin. In the case of the 1950s and 1960s, in most of the cities it’s not the case. The number of North Africans coming to Paris is merely a trickle really until after World War I.Anyway, contemporaries had the idea that what this whole process was, and I should have written this on the board, but you can write it down if you would please, called the uprooting hypothesis. You get together with people that you know from your part of China. Let me just give you a couple examples of how often well-meaning, but not always, contemporaries saw the phenomenon of urbanization and urban growth. When he’s talking about cities, he’s evoking Sodom and Gomorrah. “ In illness, the cholera carries away poor people more than rich people. What you’ve got is, if you know Paris at all, it doesn’t matter if you don’t know Paris, here’s the Garden of Luxemburg. The rings around Vienna were the rings where the walls had been that were knocked down as the city grew. I’m not dissing Grosse Pointe, Michigan, but the municipal council tried to figure out a way that you couldn’t get to Grosse Pointe from the center of Detroit unless you had a map, unless you really knew how to get there to try to keep “them,” that is, the poor people of the center, from going to the suburbs. Here is the Market of the Innocents, which it’s called. Since there were barricades in so many of these revolutions, barricades begin on the day of the barricades in Paris in 1572, or something like that, before this course stokes up. Secondly, he does this to increase the flow of capital. You still have people farming in Vaugirard and these places, Grenelle. A lot of the stuff they’re reading is based upon — they don’t really see those people up there. Here, they take the map and they say, “Let’s build boulevards.” He has one in 1855 and another one in 1866 or 1867. A mattress is the last thing you ever pawned. That’s what I mean by “imperialism of the straight line. Here again, imperialism in a straight line. There you’ve got — maybe I’ll do a thing on blowing up this building here. They tore it down to build a whole bunch of unsuccessful places and the filthy destruction of a monument. We don’t have time to talk about that, but that’s a fascinating thing."
548,history,hist-202,lecture-13,"In light of the many ethnic and national conflicts of the twentieth century, the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918 appears less surprising than the fact that it remained intact for so long. National identity is not an essential characteristic of peoples, and in many cases in Europe it is a relatively recent invention. As such, there are many different characteristics according to which national communities can be defined, or, in Benedict Anderson’s phrase, imagined. Along with religion and ethnicity, language has played a particularly important role in shaping the imaginary identification of individuals with abstract communities. No one factor necessarily determines this identification, as evidenced by modern countries such as Belgium and Switzerland that incorporate multiple linguistic and cultural groups in one national community.","It’s kind of a complicated lecture today. I want to talk about nationalism and particularly in — a little bit of France, but in places that one doesn’t usually consider. So, the Austria-Hungarian Empire is sort of a counter example to these nationalisms. In an example of just utter, craven cowardice refused to publish the book. I’m going to give you some examples taken from Anderson of even the publication of the very first dictionaries in languages that now are quite common for us to identify with ethnic national states. Because of the French Revolution and because of the development in Europe and in other places of parliamentary regimes and democracies, it’s fairly common to think, “National self-consciousness equals a desire for national states and you can’t have that with a monarchy.” The case of France, which I know more about, is equally fascinating because of the time of the French Revolution half the French population did not speak French. People spoke essentially Piedmontese, which is the language spoken in northern Italy in the strongest state of Italy, Piedmont Sardinia. You go to Catalonia and they spoke Catalan. If you go into Brittany, they spoke Breton, which has nothing to do with French at all. In other words, they don’t speak really French. Now older friends of ours understand patois, but they don’t speak it. I had something from a book that I needed someone to look at to make sure that what I’d written in patois was correct. Between 1848, the springtime of the peoples, and 1914, you have millions of people who, a couple decades before that, had absolutely no sense or very little sense of being Slovene, or Slovak, or Croat, or whatever, who are suddenly making national demands and wanting to have a separate state within the context — or to be independent from the Austria-Hungarian Empire. By the end of the nineteenth century when you’ve got these other people insisting that “we’re Slovenes” and “we’re this and that,” Belarussian speakers called themselves Russian if they were Orthodox religion. If they were simply looking out for themselves, they just called themselves local. I guess the most interesting case now would be Belgium, which I don’t have a lot of time to talk about. The Walloons, that is the French, many of the French speakers want to be attached to France, see their lives as very different. But if you’ve got all these different languages and the languages are not as far apart as French and Dutch, well in a way they are because Dutch is really, although the Dutch would not see it that way, but is a German dialect. People have a sense of being Swiss, despite these different languages. It gives them an allegiance to this apparatus. People have an allegiance to this dynasty. The army is a form of social promotion as well. The army is seen as a useful way of representing the empire."
549,history,hist-202,lecture-14,"Socialism in the nineteenth century can be divided into two different strains of thought: reformist and revolutionary. While reformist socialists believed in changing the State through legal activity, such as voting, revolutionary socialists viewed such measures as ineffective and perhaps even complicit in maintaining the status quo. Along the spectrum of leftwing political thought, syndicalists and anarchists shared the conviction that the State could not be reformed from within. In some cases, this conviction resulted in acts of violence, so-called propaganda by the deed. Émile Henry, a French anarchist, was among the first militants to target civilian rather than official targets; as such, he can be seen as one of the first modern terrorists.","So, what I want to do today is resist the temptation to talk about anarchism the entire time. Most anarchists were not terrorists, but at the end I’m going to talk about a guy that I followed around for four or five years who was a terrorist, and arguably — it’s a book I just finished — one can find the origins of modern terrorism in this guy, who is called Émile Henry. It’s obviously sort of a sub-theme in this course, and so is the state and capitalism. You can pass laws making it harder and harder to employ children, particularly in dangerous tasks. Of course, the old revolutionary socialists would become the Communists after 1920, when the French Communist Party is begun in the wake of the Russian Revolution, which seemed to be, even though it was a revolution in a very complex situation, that seemed to say that you can have a revolution. Some of the tensions between revolutionary socialists and reform socialists can be seen in the fact that revolutionary socialists said, “Look, if you are working in the Reichstag and you’re trying to get better insurance plans,” ironically it was Bismarck’s Germany that gives really the first substantial insurance program for workers, “what you’re doing is you’re propping up the bourgeois state. I’m talking basically about Western Europe. It was easy to see how they associated the state with something that they didn’t want. I want to tell you a story that’s a true story. He had married a woman from a religiously practicing Catholic family. On the other side of the room are people who are not so sure. Don’t you have something you want to tell me? He was from the east of France, from Besançon, in the mountainous Franche-Comté. He escapes through Japan, goes through the United States and ends up back in London, terrified people. There they hanged four anarchists who were called  in France. He takes the decision to kill ordinary people. There’s a terrifying scene in that fantastic, but very difficult movie — because of the torture scene, I can’t even use it in the French History course, . I believe that it kind of started with this guy. I’ve had the rather odd experience of twice, once with friends and once with my son, having eaten in the restaurant that my book subject blew up, because it’s still there, and sitting at the same table. He goes to four or five cafes, but there are not enough innocent people in them. Émile Henry had gone back to the Paris region. He tries to convince the waiter to be an anarchist. So, he becomes this sort of, for radical anarchists, he becomes a vision of how life should be. His bomb that he threw into the Terminus — this is back in 1894, this is where we started. But what you can never do is destroy anarchism. We have his notes up to the very end of his life. Our state is a good example of that, and the tendency to try to denigrate anyone who doesn’t agree with us as being terrorists, whether they were or not. What stops anarchist attacks in Spain is the fact that the public becomes aware that the police were hideously torturing people who did not agree with the politics of the State. You see where one could go in a political diatribe, which this isn’t."
550,history,hist-202,lecture-15,"The boom in European colonial expansion in the second half of the nineteenth century, the so-called New Imperialism, can be seen to follow from three principle factors, in ascending order of importance: religious proselytizing, profit, and inter-imperial political strategy. With respect to the latter concern, the conflicts emerging from imperialism set the stage for World War I. Along with its military and industrial consequences, imperialism also entailed a large-scale cultural program dedicated to strengthening support for its objectives among the domestic populations of the imperial powers. The creation of the Boy Scouts is an exemplary form of such a program, founded upon a mythology of the American frontier reformulated to encompass Africa and Asia.","I’m going to talk about imperialism today. It was particularly true of, for example, Lutheran ministers in German Southwest Africa and in other places. Therefore, they set out to, at a time of economic crisis — nothing like now, but there is a depression that lasts from 1874 to the mid-1890s — they set out to find new riches. The people going up the Niger River, for example, where I’ve been in Mali, they expected to find gold around the next bend, or more peanut oil, or diamonds, because of the diamonds in South Africa, which was the equivalent of the gold rush in the U.S. in about 1848 in California. The big parades in London of returning soldiers from the Boer War in South Africa and from other wars, from all the wars, they are greeted as conquering heroes nowhere more frenetically, enthusiastically, exuberantly than the City, because there is a link between big finance, big capital and imperialism. The New Imperialism is one of the fundamental causes of World War I, period. It wasn’t that way in every place, but the French experience was pretty terrible. Square jaw, compared to working-class “loafers” and “shirkers,” as he called them. If you’re lucky you’ll end up with a dueling scar and not actually get killed. The tendency is to say, looking back, “Well, they’re taking it out on animals, blowing the hell out of them and indigenous people, etc., In 1910, Baden-Powell resigns from the command of a division of the Territorial Army to spend the rest of his life involved in scouting. Your new frontier is going to be in Afghanistan. Again, this is the sort of moralization of the working classes. They, too, can look at maps of Africa being increasingly painted red, which was the color of the empire. Now, you have aggressive models coming from the American West. He was his own publicist and he had enormous influence in Britain. She hadn’t been to an event like that in twenty-six years. They’re wearing the uniform of these countries and they’re big-time imperialists."
551,history,hist-202,lecture-16,"If the early years of the twentieth century were marked by a general consensus that a major war was impending, no similar consensus existed concerning the likely form that war would take. Not only the carnage of World War I, but also the nature of its alliances would have been difficult to imagine. Indeed, in 1900 many people would have predicted conflict, rather than collaboration, between France and Britain. The reasons for the eventual entente between France and Britain and France and Russia consist principally in economic and geopolitical motivations. Cultural identity also played a role, particularly in relations between France and Germany. The territory of Alsace-Lorraine formed a crucible for the questions of nationalism and imaginary identity that would be contested in the Great War.","The second announcement is the movies, the films. I’ve done what I think is the way to do it. You can watch it in the privacy of your rooms in whatever college you are. I’ll talk about military strategy at the end today, or — in the plans for the war — or, depending on time, the , at the beginning of next hour. It is complicated, because the French could never accept the fact that Alsace and much of Lorraine was now German. His fear was that Germany would have to fight a war on two fronts. How can you ally with these people who are repressing socialists, who are repressing nationalities, they’re repressing everybody, and run this police state?So, the last thing that Bismarck wanted are these two big states to come together on either side of him. It is economic in that one of the old things the people say about the French economy, but it’s still true, is that French money investments, much of it goes outside of France. So, these economic ties are very important. But international circumstances, and the tensions over the Balkans, and French fears of Germany, bring Russia and France together and the French marine band plays whatever the theme song of the Russia czars is — it certainly wasn’t Doctor Zhivago — when they arrived. They’re on bad terms with the French and they’re on bad terms with the Russians, to make a long story short. The British government begins to run scared because the City is running scared. In the 1890s there were a lot of war novels about future wars. But one of the more successful was, for a brief time, was this sort of book about a future war. And that the crises, which you can read about, the Moroccan crisis in 1905 makes even firmer this military alliance. We have friends, one of them just died, older people, and they grew up in misery in the mountains. They were one of twelve or thirteen children. Alsace and Strasbourg were annexed to France in 1681 by the megalomaniac Louis XIV. But this incident at Saverne, what it does is it reinforces the stereotypes that the French have of the Germans and that the Germans have of the French. If you go up to Alsace, you go up to the Vosges Mountains. The population that spoke French as their major language was twelve percent. The idea is that they have been infected with Frenchness. But the majority of the population is Catholic. What happens in Saverne at a place where military civil relations aren’t terribly good, in this town of 8,000 people, is that there is an incident that gets blown out of proportion."
552,history,hist-202,lecture-17,"With the failure of Germany’s offensive strategy, WWI became a war of defense, in which trenches played a major role. The use of trenches and barbed wire, coupled with the deployment of new, more deadly forms of artillery, created extremely bloody stalemate situations. The hopelessness of this arrangement resulted in a number of mutinies on the French side, motivated neither by defeatism nor by ideology, but rather by the sheer horror of trench warfare. Due to the unprecedented scale of casualties, WWI impressed itself irresistibly upon the cultural imagination of the combatant nations.","I assume that you guys all saw , so I’m going to talk about the mutinies in a while. Jay Winter is going to talk about essentially the Great War in modern memory. It doesn’t matter if you don’t follow football. There are new and horrible ways of dying, flame throwers, for example, poison gas, which is first used by the Germans at Ypres, on of the many battles of Ypres. They start trying to — and lots of people died with what the Americans call friendly fire — they try to coordinate the shelling to go in advance of the people going over the top and then trying to carry sixty pounds — pick up sixty pounds some time — worth of stuff on your back, and go down into these horrible craters full of all sorts of crap, and dead floating rats, and dead floating bodies of human beings, and to try to break through. The Gatling guns had first been used in, I think, the American Civil War. You don’t know what happens to him, but his chances weren’t very good. Then they overrun their supplies, and it kind of snaps back like a rubber band and pushes them back. Again, looking at the Austro-Hungarian Empire where they had huge losses. But it’s one of these, if you’ve been to Victoria Station, it’s one of these things they always say about the war, but it’s true. Again, there is Paris and there is fighting. One of the great cathedrals anywhere in Europe. I can’t remember on the first day or not if I didn’t relate a story of people that we knew, now about eight years ago, who were actually killed because of World War I. They were killed. You’ll find there’s one town where seventy-four people died. A very small town in the south of France, in the Aveyron. But the guy was a stamp collector and I knew that. What do we know about the mutinies that confirms what you saw in the film? They actually did get together and play a soccer game. Those are where the plaques are, right there. Now, you’re here and they say, “Over the top, men.” They’re taking care of some people that have been hurt, carrying somebody back. But it is clear that when the Bolsheviks seize power in October 1917, the Russians are going to get out of the war. “ It’s at that time that the second event happens. The British, and the French, and the American high command know they’re going to win the war. The long duration, of being in until the end, was going to be a long time, if you were able to survive. Battlefields were no longer called the field of glory. Now there are a couple of good books on atrocities. The Austrians, who had been told that the Serbs were subhuman, committed atrocities there. And they want to see if their sacrifices have been in vain. The world, after all, must be a better place. The oddest thing about this, about how art and reality merge, is that this film was made before the end of the war."
553,history,hist-202,lecture-18,"As a result of World War I, Europe had a different understanding of war in the twentieth century than the United States. One of the most important ways in which the First World War was experienced on the continent and in Britain was through commemoration. By means of both mass-media technologies and older memorial forms, sites of memory offered opportunities for personal as well as political reconciliation with the unprecedented consequences of the war. The influence of these sites is still felt today, in a united Europe, as the importance of armies has diminished in favor of social welfare programs.","What I’d like to do today is to talk to you about what it is that distinguishes European ideas about the shared history of the last century and the United States. If families got to see it, then what would happen?There’s a famous story of the fictional film representation of war which is one reason why I think it is so iconic as a descriptive element in European consciousness about the past. They didn’t know that this was simply nonsense, that it was fiction. I’ll give you another example which makes the point really powerful, very, very powerful. Gallipoli was a Turkish peninsula south of Istanbul, Constantinople then. It’s about a four-hour taxi drive in lousy traffic. Yesterday, in the , two Australian politicians virtually came to blows about how to remember Gallipoli, because it is at the core of the notion or of the idea of what the nation has to be. It was a day that should be remembered and is remembered. I want to take you through the commemorative forms that the First World War created, which created cultural practices that are still very important today. It could mean that the individual was in a hospital. It’s accusing everybody of this insanity that had no end to it. There was an extraordinary efflorescence, development of spiritualism, of séances. Christianity couldn’t be interested in this. This drove the churchmen leading the Church of England apoplectic. The critical thing there is that clearly the British people voted with their feet for the national war memorial. He reduced the Arc of Triumph to nothingness. Hence, we should always recognize that commemoration is a business. What they show primarily are two kinds of representations. By that I mean small politics more than big politics. That explains why the commemorative power of the period around the First World War is not repeated after the Second. This is true in Germany, too, where the 1 of September, 1939, the outbreak of the Second World War was not greeted by marching bands, and parades, and so on. The conclusion I want to draw on is this. Robert Graves’  is still in print eighty years after he wrote it. I think the critical point to bear in mind is that the casualties of the First World War were so devastating that even the losses of the Second World War didn’t change the landscape of remembrance that was constructed between 1918 and 1939. It doesn’t stop there from being militaristic groups, and those like the Nazis who wanted to “get it right this time around,” and reverse the verdict of 1918 under the Treaty of Versailles. But it is the remembrance of the First World War which left traces in families, which are the most powerful reasons why the First World War has become and remains the iconic disaster that has created a Europe that no one had ever seen before, and that was vastly different, in the minds of ordinary people, than the Europe that existed in 1914."
554,history,hist-202,lecture-19,"The period between the Russian Revolution of February 1917, which resulted in the overthrow of the autocracy and the establishment of a provisional government, and the Bolshevik Revolution in October of that same year, offers an instructive example of revolutionary processes at work. During this interval, the fate of Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra, was bound up in the struggle for power amongst competing political factions in Russia. Until his death, Nicholas was convinced that the Russian people would rescue him from his captors. Such a belief would prove to be delusional, and the efforts on the part of liberals, socialists, and some Bolsheviks to arrange for a trial would fail to save the czar from the verdict of history.","Today I want to talk about the Russian Revolution. The revolution in February, as I said before, people wake up and there are not a lot of troops around, and people are hungry, and the — and I’ll talk more about this in a minute — autocracy falls rather quickly and rather easily. Next week I’ll talk about Stalin and Stalinism. That would come in Germany, in Britain, in France, eventually maybe in the United States. I haven’t been to St. Petersburg since , since the fall of communism, but very fancy stores in 1917, very dolled-up people, very rich people. But they still had the beliefs that the Russian people loved their czar, and that they would pour forward to save the czar, and the czarina, and the autocracy. If I remember correctly, the czar believed that the nobles had compromised the fate of the autocracy in some ways, or threatened it by being indolent and not working hard enough. Like many converts from one religion to another, was absolutely fanatic in her attachment. He was more relaxed about religion than his wife was, but he often spoke about this sort of religious ecstasy that he felt when he went to church. Whatever may happen I shall bow to His will. Even the story of his assassination, it was almost impossible to kill him. As you know, the Duma loses most of what authority it had been given. Until the end, possibly, we don’t know this — the idea that they will rise up and take him away from his captors in those final days. On one hand he’s supposed to be the czar of all the people. She believed it was in the Slavic nature. The progressive block, which I sent around on the website, she believed that the existence of the progressive block, which wouldn’t have been really possible had it not been for World War I.World War I gives opportunity to Russian dissidents to get together in ways that they couldn’t have otherwise. Again, there are lots of people who are thinking about the post-war world and who imagine or are beginning plan for a reformed czarism. So, the provisional government wants to protect them. And this clueless person had no idea that this was Kerensky, who was an historian and was trained as an historian. Anyway, then they were put back together and they didn’t have much to do. Ironically, they passed by Rasputin’s home village, and indeed his house, as a steamboat took them via two rivers to this town of Tobolsk, where I have never been. They start seeing obscene graffiti written, new guards come that had even less respect for them than the other people. The others were in that long Russian tradition of false czars or false czarinas, the kind their loyalty to whom in the eighteenth century generated so many uprisings."
555,history,hist-202,lecture-1,"The course will concern European history from 1648 to 1945. The assigned readings include both standard historical texts and works of fiction, as well as films. Although the period in question encompasses many monumental events and “great men,” attention will also be paid to the development of themes over the long term and the experiences of people and groups often excluded from official histories. Among the principle questions to be addressed are the consolidation of state power, the formation of identities, linguistic and national affiliations, and the effects of economic change.","I’m John Merriman and this is History 202. The ordinance of the Boy Scouts in Britain has a lot to do with that. So, instead of — at the very beginning of that lecture, I’ll say, “Look, there are three things you really ought to know about the New Imperialism, why they did this.” My friend and colleague, Jay Winter, is doing one of them on the Great War and modern memory. The books are , second edition, which I wrote for people like you. Zola was the first sort of naturalist novelist, at least in France. And he had the quite brilliant idea of looking at a German unit, essentially policemen from Hamburg, the port town of Hamburg, an old important Hanseatic port. By short I don’t mean two pages, but something like seven pages, eight pages on something that you want to write about. Now, let me give you some examples just off the top of my head. But then what I do is I look at some of the third string, or the third division in the European football sense, of Enlightenment hacks, and what they wrote about royalty, and about aristocrats, and the way they kind of undermined those traditional hierarchies that would be swept away, to a large extent, by the French Revolution. She did a movie, a documentary called , about Nuremburg. You may even know people like that, but I don’t think so. But one of the guys that I knew, I’ve got to get back to the topic in a minute, but I just thought of this, was sort of the king of malapropisms. And I mean it, and I love this course, so I hope that you will enjoy it, if indeed you take it. So, the consolidation of state power, which is looking at it from the state out, or the emergence of an identity where you see yourself as German as opposed to Bavarian, French as opposed to Gascon or Provencal, Spanish as opposed to Castilian or as opposed to Catalan. This is a great phrase; I wish I’d said it originally. France at the time of the French Revolution, half the people in France knew French. How does that happen by the end of the nineteenth century that people have, even Russia as they’re starving to death, starving in the famine that Tolstoy, the great writer, called the world’s attention to. It changes in ways that we’ll suggest in the reading, and then I’ll talk about a little bit, the way people live in very fundamental ways. Women’s work remains terribly, terribly important. Because threshing machines were taking away their work as harvesters. We all live in a convict colony, a convict colony, a convict colony."
556,history,hist-202,lecture-20,"Contrary to the “Great Illusion” that the end of World War I heralded a new era of peace, the interwar period can be considered to form part of a Thirty Years’ War, spanning the period from 1914 to 1945. In the wake of the Treaty of Versailles, Europe was divided both literally and figuratively, with the so-called revisionist powers frustrated over their new borders. One of the most significant and ultimately most pernicious debates at Versailles concerned the identity of states with ethnic majorities. For those nations that resented the new partition of Europe, ethnic minorities, and Jews in particular, furnished convenient scapegoats. The persecution of minority groups in Central and Eastern Europe following the First World War thus set the stage for the atrocities of World War II.","Today I’m going to do a fairly impossible task, which is to talk mostly about Eastern Europe in the interwar period. Europe was in depression basically the entire time between the wars, as we’ll see when I talk about Eastern Europe and East Central Europe. That has a lot to do with the chronic instability of the period. If you had fought a war that was based upon national claims in 1914, in which aggressive nationalism was one of the root causes of the war, the successor states that are created out of these collapsed empires find themselves facing the reality that you could get all the maps you wanted, and you could get all the cartographers that you wanted, and geographers, and bring them all to Versailles, and bring them all to the French suburbs, Trianon, and Sèvres, and Neuilly, and the others, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, that became named after the treaties with the individual powers. That leaves a permanent factor for instability. The problem is, how do you explain to home that you’ve lost the war when your troops are far, far inside Germany? Germany, again it’s hard to summarize all of this, but Germany from the very beginning says, “If you’re going to argue that national ethnic groups and where they live should determine the drawing of boundaries, then what the Allies did to Germany seemed extremely unfair,” and not only to the far right in Germany. If you make Germany pay for the whole war, based on that they’ve signed the war guilt clause, you’re going to so destabilize this country that eventually the right will take over.” I can remember going to Warsaw, , when it was still into the communist regime, when I was a kid. They’re Ukrainians, and Poles, and all sorts of things. They lose twenty-five percent of the Hungarian population to other states. I have a friend who retired here many years ago from Russian and East European languages and literatures who knows eighteen languages. Again, in 1989 the great groundswell against Ceausescu and his horrendous wife, the dictators in Romania, began with Hungarian dissidents whose families had been generations since World War I stuck, from their point of view, in Romania. It’s an imperial city not reduced in size, but reduced in importance. In the east, mostly Orthodox and Labavitcher. There’s Moravia also, which is poorer, but it is very industrial. But there were tensions within Czechoslovakia also. Even in the triumphant case, triumphant until the German legions start marching in and start killing Jews again there. I think it’s about seventy-five percent in Poland. Also, lots of the rural parts of Hungary have been amputated. What brings, and this is the argument of my good friend, Tim Snyder, what brings peasants into politics in the 1920s is one thing, besides hating the people not of the same ethnic group with them, depending on the place, and maybe being anti-Semitic because of the tradition of rural money lenders and all of this who happen to be Jewish, and Jewish storekeepers in the peasant perception of the world, is the hope of land reform, of land reform. The points are that Europe is in a period of instability."
557,history,hist-202,lecture-21,"One of the central questions in assessing Stalinism is whether or not the abuses of the latter were already present in the first years of the Russian Revolution. The archival evidence suggests that this is partly the case, and that even in its early stages Soviet Russia actively persecuted not just those who were believed to have profited unfairly, without laboring, but also non-Russian ethnic groups. Stalin, although not an ethnic Russian himself, was committed to the assimilation of national identity, and universal identification with the Soviet State. This commitment, coupled with his paranoia, lead to executions and deportations aimed at solidifying the state through exclusion of “undesirable” or politically suspect elements. Throughout years of economic hardship and violent purges, Soviet rhetoric consistently emphasized a glorious future in order to justify the miseries of the present. Such a future proved, in many ways, to be an illusion.","Today I want to talk about Stalinism, and, in doing so — fifteen years ago, lots of what we now know about the Soviet Union through its entire history we didn’t know, because the archives weren’t open. In principle, it was supposed to involve debate at the highest levels. Debate itself became, as a concept under Stalinism, identified with anti-Soviet behavior. One of the points to be made today is, following Peter Holquist, that the structure of the Stalinist terror — there were antecedents that one could see in the civil war, and in the period of Lenin’s domination in the early years of the Soviet Union. Of course, as you all know, it never came to be. The state maintained its control over heavy industry. NEP is the New Economic Policy, and the NEP men were people who did well during this period. The other, and it’s a term, as we’ll see in a while, that became a term of denigration, and indeed could lead you straight to the gulag if you were lucky and weren’t executed before that, were Kulaks. Trotsky, with Jean Jaurès, was the greatest orator of the entire period. He was expelled for reading Marxist tracts. In Russia in World War I, the imperial government, Holquist writes, “initiated a deportation of ‘the Jewish element’ — remember, the rabid anti-Semitism of the czar and Alexandra — “on the borderlines as ‘pernicious, harmful, and dangerous to the Russian people,’” and thus in wartime they are, just as in Italy. In the early years, the Lenin years, you still find these things. Many more are gunned down when they protest. They’re not going to be doing this kind of thing. Sheila Fitzpatrick is a wonderful historian. Stalinism, the essence of state collectivization, of state totalitarianism, is you have to have this enormous bureaucracy. Thus, if you see these, and I’ve been in the Moscow subway a long time ago, but these sort of heroic murals of the Soviet worker, the Stakhanovite. Or, for example, I’m not making this as an analogy, but there was the equivalent under National Socialism, also, the idea of the German worker toiling away and all that, with the interests of the state. I had this colleague a long, long time ago when I first came here who grew up in Moscow in the 1930s. I had an uncle who meant a great deal to me who was a communist."
558,history,hist-202,lecture-22,"While Nazi Germany’s crimes were unprecedented, Adolf Hitler himself was in many respects a typical figure. An idle youth, of seemingly mediocre talents, his political career and passionate hatreds were formed by the experience of World War I. The rise of fascism in Germany, as elsewhere, must be understood in the context of a postwar climate of resentment and instability. Germany’s economic crisis, in particular, led the middle classes to support National Socialism well before any other group. This resentment would find a ready outlet in the form of increasingly persecuted minority populations, above all the Jews. In considering Nazism against the backdrop of a more general wave of extreme rightwing and fascist political sentiment, it is important to note that the policies of the Third Reich were not only known to but also endorsed by the majority of the German population.","I think I mentioned the other day Leni Riefenstahl only died about four years ago, at age 102. It’s very long, and I’ll be drawing on that in part. The Nazis must be seen in the context of World War I. They must be seen in the context of the poisoning of the political atmosphere between the wars. His father was “illegitimate,” and ended up with the name of his mother’s long-deceased wife’s father, Georg Heidler, which in 1876 became Hitler, as I said. This was important in his obsession with uniting the two countries. He did not pick up his anti-Semitism in Linz. He wanted him to follow and be the next in line of the Hitler civil servants. He had one friend, August Kubizek, who was the son of an upholsterer. He had that little mustache that would become bigger. Of course, one of the ironies is during the Second World War that women are increasingly doing jobs that Hitler and Mussolini thought were inappropriate, simply because the men were dead. In the words of Kershaw, the First World War made Hitler possible. The SPD, the Socialist Veterans Organization, was the largest of them all. The thing that’s really just incredible is that the people had memories of Hitler — when you see pictures of him, this kind of you would say in French, this kind of sad sack wearing ill-fitting clothes, did not have friends. He was scared, because there were machine guns. He sneezed and he blew his nose on his sleeve.” Hitler was supported by the middle classes disproportionately at the beginning. But in all classes people supported him, workers less so. The main elements of fascism that I list in that book, if you think about them, they all apply to Hitler and to the people who followed him: anti-communist, anti-socialist, anti-Weimar, the role of the economic crisis with long, long memories, and hating the allies, and hating the Jews, and hating the Socialists. What they want is a totalitarian state and the destruction of parliamentary rule. They want a , as Mussolini called himself. He’s going to represent you and he’s going to tell you what to do. The war on crimes is something they like. Military history, chairs in military history, chairs in German history, chairs particularly in German medieval history. Not everybody believed, but that’s one of the scariest things about the whole thing, that it was  until the end. Hitler gives the German people what they want."
559,history,hist-202,lecture-23,"One of the principal myths concerning collaboration during World War II in France, as in other countries, is that the domestic collaborators did so despite themselves, or to prevent even greater atrocities. In fact, many French, Belgians, Hungarians, Poles, Dutch and others voluntarily and enthusiastically abetted the occupying Germans. This collaboration, inspired by anti-Semitism and xenophobia, often resulted in extremely zealous persecution of Jewish nationals, communists, and others. Along with the myth of reluctant collaboration, France has also been obliged to confront the myth of widespread resistance, promulgated in part by a victorious Charles de Gaulle. Many questions concerning collaboration and resistance still remain unresolved in formerly occupied European countries to this day.","Okay, I want today to talk about collaboration, but above all, resistance in Europe during World War II. We haven’t talked about France in a long time. It doesn’t have anything to do with resistance, because it was impossible, but it was about the German ideas of creating this Aryan city in Lodz, which was a big industrial town, and still is, in Poland. When I talk about France, the reason — and I sent this term around — you called the French resistors the , or even just , is because they were able to hide behind brush called . There’s hardly a hill that’s more than a hump in Denmark, but yet is was the Danes in Copenhagen who saved the Jews, who got them out, with the help of a German officer, and were able to get them just across the very narrow straits to Malmo in Sweden. The , the resistors, were very active there. But the next step to thinking about that is who in France made all those things possible? The answer is that lots of people collaborated. Lots of people got what they wanted on a platter because of the Nazi victory. It was a documentary made for French television by Max Ophüls. It was never shown on French television until 1981. They ask about the teacher, a teacher who disappeared. He’s about ten years older than me, probably more than that. There’s a more recent book by a guy called Philip Burrin that I use in the seminar on Vichy that I do from time to time, a junior seminar, which explores more deeply, using these archives that are now available, the whole question of collaboration. My friend John Sweets, who did a book called, a great title in which he looked at Clermont-Ferrand, because that was where the movie  were focused on. Later in the war the kinds of people who joined the militia, which formed in January 1943, which was the French equivalent of the Gestapo, tended to be sort of down and out. They were the kinds of people who in Germany joined the SS, many of them in the 1920s, saw it as a form of social mobility. One of the reasons why the Germans occupied so-called free France in November of 1942 was the fact that resistance had already started. But it was just sort of a metaphor for places that you could hide. By 1944, by certainly the spring of 1944, and in many places earlier than that, the  ruled, at least at night. They did it all the time, down in the Rhone Valley constantly. You had to be careful about who you talked to. At that point — choices in Vichy, France — “I’m going to go in the resistance,” big choice. There was tons of resistance in Brittany. Eisenhower after the war said the French resistance was worth an entire division, or two divisions, I can’t remember exactly what he said. He and his wife, the first vacations, they took a double bike. They left this village standing the way it always — it’s still there. There were riots in Colmar, in Strasbourg, that they should ever be put on trial."
560,history,hist-202,lecture-24,"The disintegration of the Soviet Union resulted from a number of different factors. Three important ones are nationalism among Soviet satellite states, democratic opposition movements, and economic crisis. Along with these elements, the role of Mikhail Gorbachev should not be discounted. Although his attempt to reform communism was rejected, his reformist positions as Soviet premier helped open the way for full-fledged political dissidence. One of the major challenges faced by Europe in the wake of the collapse of communism has been that posed by ethnic nationalism, a problem that erupted violently in the Balkans in the 1990s. Immigration and the defense of human rights are two problems that now confront the United States, as well as a United Europe.","I guess what I’ll do today is talk a little bit about the fall of communism. It was relegated a few years ago, he actually did a TV ad for Burger King, at that point, because he needed the money. In 1968, when Dubcek, who ends up basically with janitorial duties after that, tried to put a human face on communism and reform communism, there were, as the expression goes, tanks before teatime. One guy burned himself to death in protest. Well, Ronald Reagan really couldn’t either. He’s very, very different than his predecessors. That was the hush-hush where you didn’t talk about the failings of the system. It didn’t work out the way he thought it was going to work out. Solzhenitsyn, I used to run into him here in the Sterling Memorial Library. So, the passing to the new generation, despite all the economic problems, and despite the ethnic tensions that would remain, was much easier than it would be in Bulgaria, for example. How do you create this sort of civic culture? One of the effects is, for example, the obstruction of the Black Forest in Germany by these clouds of pollution coming from the Czech Republic, to say nothing of the fact that a lot of the Soviet nuclear installations were in Kazakhstan, and other places, and trying to get these diffused and immobilized, particularly when the United States has been, under this last regime, has been trying to restart the arms race. The Americans now have this idea to put bases in Poland. When he came here, he came here as sort of a symbol of anti-globalization. Once you got into Spain you’ve essentially got it made. When it becomes acceptable, and maybe some of you may consider unfair, but when Sarkozy, president of France, he’s the son of Hungarian immigrants, and when he borrows the language, the language of racism, the language of Le Pen, to help put him over the top — and when someone interviewed Le Pen and said, “Why do you do so badly in the elections?” This is an obvious thing to say, but this is the future. This is an ongoing problem, an ongoing challenge, in every single European country. And secret plane flights to England, or to wherever, this is what made the United States lose so much of its image, of its respect. Even in a place that I live with 330 people — and people are not terribly politicized, politics is still families that have hated each other for generations — but there is this image of, “How could this happen in the United States?” It was what this country represents to Europeans."
561,history,hist-202,lecture-2,"The rise of absolutism in Europe must be understood in the context of insecurity attending the religious wars of the first half of the seventeenth century, and the Thirty Years’ War in particular. Faced with the unprecedented brutality and devastation of these conflicts, European nobles and landowners were increasingly willing to surrender their independence to the authority of a single, all-powerful monarch in return for guaranteed protection. Among the consequences of this consolidation of state power were the formation of large standing armies and bureaucratic systems, the curtailment of municipal privileges, and the birth of international law.","So, what I want to do today — again, this is a parallel holding pattern lecture. And which, in the case of England, the civil war was largely fought, to a great extent anyway, trying to prevent the English monarchy from taking on characteristics of those emerging absolute states on the continent. That’s an important point, because it tells you what really is the big picture that is going to emerge. There really can’t be a challenge to them from the state itself. When royal authority conquers these rebels, the  — you don’t have to remember any of that, F-R-O-N-D-E, it’s good cocktail party conversation, or something like that, but it’s important — he makes them, literally, he’s a bigger guy then, they literally come and they bow down, and they swear allegiance to him in exchange for protection and the recognition of their privileges as nobles, as titled nobles. He only goes back to Paris I think three times ever. The most interesting is Vaux-le-Vicomte, which is southeast of Paris. The château was so big that when it freezes, they were trying to get to the bathroom and most of them never made it and peed on these long corridors that some of you have seen. As I said, in some context last time, how many Russian peasants died in the 1890s thinking, “Oh my god, if the czar only knew that we’re starving, how angry he would be with his officials.” Now, in the case of England, one of the causes of the English Civil War is the refusal of the kings to pay any attention, to recognize the rights of parliament that people in the British , in the British collective memory — I believe started on June 15, which is my birthday, 1215, although I wasn’t born yet in 1215. Peter the Great was a huge sort of power-forward-sized guy at a time when people were very small. That, my friends, is part of what it meant. So, in order to raise money, you have to enforce taxes. Or to make money you’ll sell noble titles. You have to have people who live in these fortifications. Hobbes wants this sort of dictatorship to keep people from brawling in the state of nature. Theodore Rabb’s argument is basically that the terrible wars of religion that had ripped central Europe apart in the middle of the nineteenth century led people to look for the kinds of safety provided by a strong ruler. Louis XIII helped expand the compelling course of structures of the French state. This is a pretty dramatic representation of war. The point of this is it didn’t matter who you were. There were already bureaucrats representing the royal will. Wednesday I’m going to talk about exceptions to absolutism, what the Dutch and what the English had in common that gave them very different political outcomes."
562,history,hist-202,lecture-3,"Several reasons can be found to explain why Great Britain and the Netherlands did not follow the other major European powers of the seventeenth century in adopting absolutist rule. Chief among these were the presence of a relatively large middle class, with a vested interest in preserving independence from centralized authority, and national traditions of resistance dating from the English Civil War and the Dutch war for independence from Spain, respectively. In both countries anti-absolutism formed part of a sense of national identity, and was linked to popular anti-Catholicism. The officially Protestant Dutch, in particular, had a culture of decentralized mercantile activity far removed from the militarism and excess associated with the courts of Louis XIV and Frederick the Great.","We talked about different political outcomes. This parallels exactly what you are reading. Again, until we get our class set and all that, then there will be a very different kind of lecture starting next Monday. Privilege came from wealth and wealth stemmed from the land. There are nobles around Toulouse who have invested in commercial agriculture. London, already by the late sixteenth century, one-sixth of all the people, I think this is E. A. Wrigley who pointed this out a long time ago — one-sixth of all the people in England went to London frequently, because London was absolutely gigantic as a city. If you go into what now is Serbia, there basically was Belgrade, which was a small place. One of the great shifts in English/British history that you will become aware of is the shift of economic dynamism in England away from the south to the north. We’re kind of guessing on these population figures. The English Civil War, it’s kind of a generalization to underline that too much, but nonetheless, people living in England in the 1640s saw that there was a real threat to the idea of the freeborn Englishman that was coming from the trampling of long-assumed rights, since at least the thirteenth century, at least in the imagination of people by kings who wanted to dispense with the rights of parliament and run things as they wanted to. In the case of the Netherlands, it’s the same thing. But it does mean that this decentralization is an essential part of who they thought they were. When the British get into World War I, it’s because of the violation of Belgian neutrality by the Germans, because the idea of having another enemy…we’ve already got the French across the channel and it’s not that big a channel. But if you’ve got the Germans in Ostende eating , eating mussels with French fries, and you’ve already got the French there, this is unthinkable. Anti-Catholicism is very much strongly entrenched in the British sense of who they were. They are involved in commerce, some of them, but mostly what they do is they serve the state. This isn’t scuba diving now off the Great Barrier Reef, or something like that. What this means is that boats can dock outside these kind of big warehouses and can unload or, depending on the case, load goods. Now, here, these are houses that are built along the canals. He was so jealous that he threw him in the , threw him in jail and confiscated it. But the image is just that this is very different. My cat yesterday actually undid my Yale password last night. These people are all drinking and leaving these poor little children to their own devices. It has a lot to do with the global trade."
563,history,hist-202,lecture-4,"Peter the Great’s historical significance stems not only from his military ambitions and the great expansion of the Russian Empire under his supervision, but also from his efforts to introduce secular, Western customs and ideas into Russian culture. Despite his notorious personal brutality, Peter’s enthusiasm for science and modern intellectual concerns made an indelible mark both on Russia’s relationship to the West and on its internal politics. The struggle under Peter’s reign between Westernizers and Slavophiles, or those who resist foreign influences, can be seen at work in Russia up to the present day.","Ok, I want to talk about Peter the Great today. Peter’s new fleet, we’ll talk about his new fleet, which he oversaw and, in a very minor way, helped build himself, sails down the Don River in 1698 and takes the Turkish port of Azov, A-Z-O-V, on the Sea of Azov. It was not in the consciousness of the great powers. It’s very difficult for us to imagine a fear of Sweden. Now, to be sure, in Siberia in the far reaches of the north, North Asia, this empire amounted to little more than a series of trading posts, and it took a very long time for any semblance of Russian authority from Moscow and soon from St. Petersburg, for reasons that we’ll see, to reach there. Because, after all, European Russia is part of Europe and will have an enormous influence on Asian affairs as well. He was interested in math and in geography, and thus in maps and map making. What he does is he takes this archaic state structure in which literally nothing had been written down. He transforms Russia into an European absolute monarchy with much in common with Frederick the Great, with Sweden, with Austria, the Austria of the Hapsburgs, with Spain, and with France. This is not just a uniquely Russian tale, as you can see. He was so much bigger than everybody else, so people really were not taken aback, because this was a time when physical imperfections were commonplace. But there are more images of him identified with horribly worn boots with his toes sometimes sneaking through at the end that seemed to reflect his great personal thrift, wearing stockings, it was said, that he darned himself, and a battered hat that he kept on wearing that he had worn at the Battle of Poltava in 1709, complete with a bullet hole that supposedly tore through it, missing his head. In 1717 in Paris, Lindsey Hughes reports, he went to a private house instead of the Louvre palace. He ordered 200 bottles of Hermitage wine. But she liked his natural manner and informality. Again, this is his personal ambivalence about his own role, hanging around with ordinary people, sleeping in peasant lodgings and that sort of thing. Again, this is just his personal ambivalence about who he was, and his uncertainty about the role that he had in his own family. I don’t read Russian, but he made spelling mistakes when he wrote. So, I already said what the number of square miles that were increased, but it increases from six to sixteen million of the population. By 1708 and 1709 he has created a more European-style administration for this vast empire. What’s important about the construction of St. Petersburg — I don’t know how many of you have ever been there; I haven’t been there for a very, very long time — this city is not like Moscow at all. It is an example of what I call the imperialism of the straight line, where you have large boulevards that you can march armies down to, reviewing stands and all of that, totally different than Moscow. They’re also studying the life of the mind. But he thought that it should be channeled through state obligations, be there taxes or labor duties."
564,history,hist-202,lecture-5,"While the major philosophical projects of the Enlightenment are associated with the names of individual thinkers such as Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire, the cultural transformation in France in the years leading up to the Revolution should also be understood in the context of the public sphere and popular press. Alongside such luminaries as those associated with Diderot’s  were a host of lesser pamphleteers and libellists eager for fame and some degree of fortune. If the writings of this latter group were typically vulgar and bereft of literary merit, they nonetheless contributed to the “desacralization” of monarchy in the eyes of the growing literate public. Lawyers’ briefs, scandal sheets and pornographic novels all played a role in robbing the monarchy of its claim to sacred authority at the same time as they helped advance the critique of despotism that would serve as a major impetus for the Revolution.","This is the beginning of the French part of the course. The were the thinkers of the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment stretched across frontiers. There are equivalents of these in other place. They are secularizing institutions that the members mostly all agree, agreed in the eighteenth century, that the church’s public institution role is too important. This is a second way in which these ideas get out. People would come together to eat, to drink, and to discuss ideas. The high Enlightenment really ends in 1778, traditionally. A lot of them live in Paris around now around Odéon. These were , the kind of rabble of Grub Street. Bob Darnton, when he was a young professor, before that a young graduate student, he hit the jackpot. They’d be stuffed with all sorts of things — pens and pins and — I think I mentioned this is another context — and religious literature, but also hidden at the bottom, beneath the religious literature, they are smuggling into France Enlightenment literature. Let me just race over here and give you just an example of — where is this stuff? — It contributes to what has been called the desacralization of the French monarchy. This is from his work on lawyers in the eighteenth century. We’ll give you an example of how this fits together. It fits into the Enlightenment stuff, because if Enlightenment literature was censored and sometimes hard to get hold of, though an encyclopedia was tolerated and then not tolerated and then tolerated again, what Bell’s work on lawyers demonstrates is the way in which lawyers and legal briefs help get these ideas around as well. He sent out the troops to burn down Jansenist abbeys, the big one was called Port-Royal outside of Paris. But the only point of that is that there are lawyers who begin to defend the Jansenists and begin to see the actions of the king  this persecuted religious minority as despotic. These lawyers begin turning out these legal briefs that imply the same two things: that absolute monarchy is risking stepping over the lines of the acceptable and behaving in a despotic way, and that there is something called the nation in which nobody would have imagined that classes were all equal — the discourse of liberty, fraternity and equality is a hell of a long way away — but that the traditional rights of the nation are being betrayed by the monarchy and that things isn’t so good at Versailles. The 10,000 nobles who were clustered around Louis XVI and particularly his wife were undermining the authority and the prestige of the monarchy, and that wasn’t a good thing. That exactly, not much more than a year later, is what is going to play out in the French Revolution itself."
565,history,hist-202,lecture-6,"Robespierre’s ascetic personal life and severe philosophy of political engagement are attributed by some to his difficult childhood. As a revolutionary, one of his most significant insights was that the Revolution was threatened not only by France’s military adversaries abroad, but also by domestic counter-revolutionaries. Under this latter heading were gathered two major groups, urban mercantilists and rural peasants. Relative strength of religious commitment is the major factor in explaining why some regions of France rose up in defense of the monarchy while others supported the Revolution.","I’m going to talk about the French Revolution. In doing so I want to talk about the terror and, above all, why it was that people supported or opposed the Revolution. This is not Louis XVI.They’re going to ask him to respond to the charges, and the old boy will. “ He spoke to us with the kind of gravity which impressed us. He was forced into a seriousness and responsibility. ”At the beginning, but only in the beginning, he did not believe in capital punishment; although, arguably those who agree with him would say that he saved the Revolution by meting out capital punishment. Sixty-eight times he spoke in 1789 and he gradually gets his reputation there. He was always well combed and powdered, the cleanest of dressing gowns, et cetera. That’s another French term so important it worked its way into English dictionaries. If you were for the Revolution, you were part of the people. So, he believes in the necessity of a single will. He was against , people having too much unearned property. Although one had to be, and many people were, cynical about this, when the French troops poured into the Rhineland, the prostitutes of the Rhineland cities dressed up in red, white, and blue flags to welcome their new clients. Robespierre made a series of speeches against this Brissot, who was the former Grub Street writer that I mentioned before, arguing that France should not go to war. I’m not going to use these papers to do this. Varennes was merely where the king is caught. By the way, there are groups even further to the left. Looking at people who rebelled and ones who didn’t, one of the things we can say at least about that particular area, but it really rings true, is that areas in which that traditional elite, noble and priest, had not been broken down by the economic and social changes of the eighteenth century. I’m going to give you three and if you don’t like that, too bad. But in Brittany and in Normandy they did, massively. Here again, the areas that were counter-revolutionary, particularly up in Brittany and Poitou and those regions there, the big story was these major kinds of change. Secondly, that it’s a reflex action to save the republic. How may one bear the torture of seeing this horrible succession of traitors?”Perhaps he thought that his own death would rouse the patriots, that is the Sans-Culottes in the sections, in the neighborhoods of particularly central and eastern Paris. Until they know what to do with him, at one point he’s laying on a table and he points, with Saint-Just, they point to the declaration of the rights of man and of citizen."
566,history,hist-202,lecture-7,"One way of understanding Napoleon’s life is through attention to his Corsican origins. Although Napoleon himself would later disavow his earlier identification with the island in favor of French identity, many of his actions and attitudes agree with stereotypical notions of Corsican culture. Did Napoleon inaugurate the era of total war? This question, posed in a recent book, is up for debate. On one hand, the violence of the Revolution and the Napoleonic wars may not seem uniquely devastating in comparison to the ravages of the Thirty Years’ War. On the other hand, the faltering of distinctions between civilian and combatant as well as the large-scale mobilization of state resources for war do anticipate the modern concept of total war, typically associated with World War II.","Okay, I’m going to talk about Napoleon today. Napoleon continues to fascinate, though not necessarily me. But not of a gravesite, because they were never properly buried, but a place where expired in the snows of 1812 a good number of soldiers of Napoleon’s Grande Armée, the grand army; and, so, 1812 still goes on. In fact, when you drive around Corsica, most of the radio stations that you can get are Italian and not French. He wrote in Valance, when he was posted to Valance, again on the Rhone River about an hour now by car south of Lyon. His father, Carlo, had in his own view, that is Napoleon’s view, betrayed the Corsican cause by going over to the French. In a way, you could argue that he’s rebelling against his father, at least in the early stages. But the Revolution did bring a change, obviously. One of the amazing things about Napoleon was his luck. So, Napoleon there happened to be a lucky fellow as well. He now hated Paoli, who he blamed for having turned so many Corsicans against France. He had embraced the national identity of being French and he did take ideas seriously. On the island of Saint Helena in the middle of nowhere, where he had a lot of time to think, he wrote, “I am more,” that’s where the town of Brienne was, his military school, Reims, Épernay Champagne, and all these good things. “ One of the stereotypes, though there’s some truth with this, is the idea of family loyalty. Let’s now turn to this question of whether we think — and it’s just a rhetorical question — whether my dear friend, David Bell, is right that you can see the origins of total war in this period. One thing that I’m a little skeptical about is that if you compare this to the Thirty Years’ War — and you saw those ghoulish illustrations before of different ways you could perish at the hands of enemies determined for no particular reason, in many cases, to simply destroy you — it’s not clear that the Revolutionary period and the Napoleonic wars really was the first. It happens in the Turkish massacres of the Armenians in 1895 and 1915. The , a mass military conscription that all male citizens are going to be in the army. Marshal Ney famously throws himself into his arms after having been sent to arrest him. One of the things about these civil wars, and the case was true in Spain, was that from the point of view of soldiers in a guerilla war, anyone was a potential assailant. This is just to amplify what you’re reading about."
567,history,hist-202,lecture-8,"The Industrial Revolution was for a long time treated as a decisive break in which some countries, specifically England, innovated and progressed rapidly while others were left behind. This type of analysis leads many historians to overlook the more gradual process of industrialization in countries like France, and the persistence of older methods of artisanal production alongside new forms of mechanization. To understand the Industrial Revolution it is also necessary to take into account the Agricultural Revolution; the consequences of these twin developments include urban expansion and the “proletarianization” of rural laborers. Among the consequences of industrialization for workers are the imposition of industrial discipline and the emergence of schemes such as Taylorism dedicated to more efficiently exploiting industrial labor.","Today I want to talk about the Industrial Revolution from a variety of aspects. Indeed, those are classic cases of industrial concentration, where you do have really significant mechanization over a very long period of time. But again, and we’ve underestimated — in fact, the second edition has more about this than the first, which you’re reading — the degree of industrial production in the late Russian empire. She reexamined the Industrial Revolution and discovered that, for example, the town of Birmingham, which produced all sorts of toys, big toy manufacturers, that even though you had a lot of factories, you still had a lot of the toys being finished or even produced by women working in the hinterland, that is, the , or the environs of Birmingham. The details aren’t as important as the fact that, to be sure, the mines that you read about in , which is a great, great read, and the factories that I will describe in a while are described by Engels — and I couldn’t do better than that — are a reality and they become the industrial experience. These three things, Industrial Revolution, Agricultural Revolution, and the growth of cities, are very much tied together. What the growth of Manchester does is it really changes the countryside around and helps bring the Agricultural Revolution. It used to be famous for its cherries, and fruits, and that kind of thing that they were producing for the urban market. Large-scale industrialization has a lot to do with that. The estimates in Paris go from 20,000 to 100,000. Here again, history has its history, too. Everybody wanted to find the making of class-conscious workers in various places. If you learn the skills, there’s no one who’s going to say no, you can’t get in this union. You might be able to get in this mutual aid society or friendly society, but you can’t do the work because the guilds are gone. The corporation acts are reinforced by the fear in Britain of the French Revolution. Because there’s so many other people making suits as well. Along comes this new technological innovation. So, somebody invents one of these decals that can be baked on to high quality plates between the first and second baking. Then a machine is invented that comes along and does the same thing. That is a discussion of industrial discipline. I always had my mighty maize and blue Michigan shirt on. It would build up a lot of pressure and the last thing I remember him saying was, “Listen, idiot,” that was me, “don’t leave your finger on that button very long. He’s still somebody you see kind of walking through and all that. In the case of a strike in Limoges, France, the owner of the factory was an American called David Haviland, as in Haviland porcelain, at one point actually demands that the U.S. Embassy send in the U.S. Marines, as if that was possible in order to put an end to this disturbance, this disorder in his factory. They are forced to eat inside the factory. He becomes the darling of the French car manufacturers."
568,history,hist-202,lecture-9,"The nineteenth century in Europe is, in many ways, synonymous with the rise of the bourgeoisie. It is misleading, however, to consider this newly dominant middle class as a homogenous group; rather, the century may be more accurately described in terms of the rise of plural middle classes. While the classes comprising this group were united by their search for power based on property rights rather than hereditary privilege, they were otherwise strikingly diverse. Contemporary stereotypes of the bourgeois as a grasping philistine ought to therefore be nuanced. Along with the real, undeniable cruelty of many capitalists with respect to their workers, the middle classes also pioneered the first philanthropic voluntary associations, broadened the reach of public education, and inspired the development of effective birth control.","When I do this course and when I do the first half of the French course I do a lecture on the bourgeoisie, the middle classes. One day I was about to go out among you all and talk about Daumier, and show you some Daumier slides about the bourgeoisie, and my wife said to me, “You can’t go talk about the bourgeoisie looking like you usually do. But I hope to make some sense of that in the lecture. Once we’ve got an increase in the wealth of the middle classes and the diversity and complexity that I’ll talk about in a minute, then you wanted the political power. All of these things are closely tied to the middle classes. I spoke to him about the disgraceful, unhealthy slums and drew his attention to the disgusting condition of that part of town in which the factory workers lived. I don’t know what that means, but the main thing is that they wanted to save animals from being beaten, almost beaten to death in many cases of horses. In the case of peasants it depends on where. They found to their horror that it was less than they thought. It probably approaches twenty-five percent. The old Hanseatic port cities of German, the German free cities that would become part of unified Germany in 1871 — northern German cities in general, like Bremen, and Lübeck, and Hamburg above all. If you went to Madrid, you’d find a sizeable middle class, but it would be nothing that you would have if you compared Madrid to Barcelona. What also makes them the high bourgeoisie or the big bourgeoisie, a small percentage, it doesn’t really matter where this line goes, is that they have access to political power. Remember doctors had very low social status. Then at the bottom you have the petty bourgeoisie, and everybody’s making fun of the petty bourgeoisie, but they too had a self-identity. Master artisans own the tools that their journeymen work with. His one suit isn’t going to blow off his body. Then you have to imagine this as a ladder, like this. This is the other, what would it be in the case of Paris, eighty-three percent of the population. This pole that is put up there has a real sense of dividing these. These things can be represented spatially very easily. What the middle class wants, all those people in that triangle, they want privacy. Back before the Bush dollar, people would buy, bring back from Paris and from Europe these enormously heavy copper pots. The middle class wants privacy and they also developed something else. You started working, helping out when you were five or six years old. They were a very, very Catholic family in the center of France. France is a particular case because they get rid of — you could get around it by primogeniture. Here’s the little girl being trotted out to play a few notes for the quite bored people who are sitting there and waiting."
569,history,hist-210,lecture-10,"Professor Freedman begins his discussion of Gregory of Tours’ history of the Merovingian kings.  This history differs markedly from the classical invective style used by Procopius. Gregory of Tours’ account seems more random by comparison and emphasizes the intervention of the supernatural in everyday life, particularly through the miracles of St. Martin of Tours. Gregory begins his account by showing how Clovis established Frankish hegemony and secured the prominence of the Franks in the post-Roman West.  That the Franks were the first Catholic (as opposed to Arian) people among the barbarian invaders also figures heavily in his account. Professor Freedman ends the lecture with a discussion of Clovis’ sons, among whom Clovis had divided his empire.  Despite their violent internecine conflicts„ Gregory of Tours considers them and their father to be appropriate rulers for savage times.","Here we enter further into a stranger world. But that loses some of the random quality– or seemingly random quality– that Gregory has. So in one of the little sections of Book 3 that’s not in Murray, he’s telling us now we have a miracle: “There lived at the city of Langres, Saint Gregory, that priest of God famed far and wide for his miracles and virtuous deeds. Weren’t we talking about Theuderic and Chlothar and their feud? In his time, there was still a distinction between Romans and barbarians, and Gregory was very conscious of himself as a Roman. At one point, in one of those episodes not in Murray, he says, “If you celebrate the feast of Saint Martin faithfully, you will gain the protection of the saintly bishop in this world and the next.” And the king, thug though he is, has issued an order saying the troops were not to take anything except fodder and water. Martin is an angry saint, or potentially angry. And generally speaking, those who disobey God are punished. And particularly as they’re not off on the side. This is not so dissimilar, in that sense. He’ll have arguments, again in your reading for next week, with the king himself about the Trinity, and has to defend himself against the charge of slandering the king’s concubine– really, here, the word “concubine” isn’t quite right, because these kings are kind of polygamists– against the king’s favorite, Fredegund. I’ve said he regards them as thugs and barbarians. Remember we mentioned, in the life of Saint Antoninus of Noricum,  that an emissary was sent from the Roman army to try to get paid and discovered that the Empire no longer existed. Notice that this shows a certain leader/follower relationship, rather than absolute ruler/follower relationship. ”Yeah, dubious story, but interesting because it shows both the power of the ruler and some limitations, as well as his type of piety. It is important to seek out those who would oppose you. And so that it takes a Catholic bishop to heal him back to sight. With the women dressed in black, their hair hanging loose, covered in ashes, lamented. For the time being, Clovis considers himself a representative of the Byzantine Empire, but a representative who very conveniently doesn’t have to do anything. And his mother, Queen Chlothild, prays to Saint Martin. And as you read further into the grandsons of Clovis, people whom Gregory himself has dealings with, particularly the wayward Chilperic, you’ll see rulers that Gregory considers to be evil and rulers who are really falling away from the example."
570,history,hist-210,lecture-11,"Professor Freedman considers the Merovingians as an example of barbarian kingship in the post-Roman world. In the absence of a strong government, Merovingian society was held together by kinship, private vengeance, and religion. Kings were judged by their ability to lead men in war.  Gregory of Tours believed that the violence characteristic of Frankish society was useful insofar as the kings wielded it to back up threats of supernatural retribution for bad actions.  Professor Freedman ends with a brief summary of the decline of the Merovingians.","So today is an exciting day, because the papers are due, because the midterm is soon, but most of all, because we’re finishing up our talk on the Merovingians. This becomes a question when two things start to fail. And the other factor is when the people themselves don’t really believe that there is any force holding their society together, anything that they unconsciously give deference to. In the Middle Ages– and here we’re talking about the period from the collapse of Roman authority in the West in the fifth century until at least the twelfth century– there are various kinds of societies that are held together. Educating your children, signing up for Social Security, being part of a community. Part of the reason for social ties is protection. And it wasn’t the Dark Ages, I hope to show. “So Chilperic issued a circular”– this is on page 111– “a circular to the effect that the Holy Trinity was to refer not to distinct persons, but only God. Well, you know, people had died, and they certainly had written huge controversial works, and had lots of councils over this issue. I mean, he is very courageous to say this to the king. That shows you, at least, the humiliation that is involved in this haircutting. He will renounce them, and he will be married only to Galswinthe. “She complained to the king of the wrongs that she constantly had to endure, and said that he no respect for her. But he made up various excuses, he mollified her with sweet words, and in the end, he had her strangled by a slave, and he himself found the corpse on the bed. To those who saw it, this did not happen without a great miracle. I have tried not to overemphasize the violence of this society, but it is a society in which war leadership is one of two major criteria of political leadership, the other being spiritual leadership, that we’re going to talk about towards the end of the lecture. For the time being, in the world of Gregory of Tours, the kings are wealthy. And they’re wealthy because of plunder, but also because of taxes. Now, these are the children of Fredegunde, the lower-status but extremely powerful concubine, wife, whatever you want to call her. But the belief that supernatural forces affect politics, the belief in the political leaders themselves, the knowledge that they are evil, and that God has, at least for a while, committed this evil is very, very powerful, and very, very uppermost in the mind of even an uneducated and, as Gregory himself demonstrates, normally thoroughly unscrupulous character like Fredegunde. But bishops, as well as monks, are associated with some kind of saint protector. That is, they are landowners, patrons, more or less generous to the poor or to the people of the area that they rule. Gregory himself, and his work is full of other examples of bishops who stand up to the ruler and remonstrate with the ruler. Oh, uh, I just thought it was a regular old monastery. J-A-V-O-L-S. A quarrel ensued between him and Bishop Parthenius, in which this count insults the bishop, abuses him, accuses them of all sorts of crimes, and seized the property of the Church, which is, of course, what he really wanted to do. What is happening here, behind the unedifying drama of violence and feud within a dysfunctional family– dysfunctional, a word unknown in Merovingian Frankish, I’m pretty convinced– is that certain regions of the Frankish realm are identified."
571,history,hist-210,lecture-12,"In this lecture, Professor Freedman considers the importance of the British Isles in the early Middle Ages, both in their own right and as an example of a post-Roman frontier society. In the wake of the fifth century Roman withdrawal, England experienced “radical economic simplification.” However, England’s conversion to Christianity beginning at the end of the sixth century brought about a flourishing written culture and Latin learning. Ireland experienced a similar cultural flowering, although it had converted to Christianity centuries earlier. It had never been colonized by the Romans, and the Irish Church was less hierarchical, more decentralized, and placed less importance on bishops than did the Roman. The conversion of England under the competeing influences of Rome and ireland was thus not just a conflict between Christianity and paganism, but also between two administrative styles of Christianity. Professor Freedman ends the lecture with a few remarks on the cultural accomplishments of the British Isles.","Today, we’re going to talk about Ireland and England, predominantly England, not because Ireland isn’t important, but because we know less about Ireland. A lot more has been done with excavating sites in England. Now by England, we mean literally England, the part that is not Wales, not Scotland, not Ireland, the part of the British Isles. The Angles give their name to England, Angle-land. But the Celts tended not to have cities, or at least large centers. Insofar as he is real, he may be identified with Celtic resistance to the Anglo-Saxons invaders, Celtic-Roman resistance in the late fifth, early sixth centuries. So the original setting of the Arthurian stories is that of the resistance to the Anglo-Saxon invaders. So as Wickham says on page 151, “Nowhere else in the Roman Empire was the collapse of culture, economy and urbanization so complete.” If it were just a story of barbarization, it would be less interesting than in fact the peculiar nature of England in this period, which goes from being a contested territory between the Germanic invaders and the Celtic population to a kingdom slowly converted, in the course of the seventh century, to Christianity from paganism, to the leading center of culture in Europe. These are very different kinds of works from what might interest us. We cannot track animals, most of us, and those of you can, I’m interested in your knowledge. Most of us haven’t the faintest idea how things grow except because we’ve been to the Yale farm, and “Oh my gosh, look at this stuff.” This is Augustine of Canterbury, not Augustine of Hippo,   Augustine. And on this map, what I’d like you to know particularly are Kent, with Canterbury as its capital in the southeast; Wessex in the west, which I think I’ve helpfully underlined; Mercia, towards the center; Northumbria, umbrella, northeast. And the point of that is, of course, that people accumulate treasure for non-economic reasons, for reasons that have to do with their own satisfaction or their own anxieties. And they also were less fixed in one place. And so when we refer to the Irish or the Celtic Church, we mean this more decentralized Church, this somewhat more wandering missionary Church, a Church that was less hierarchical and less organized around bishops than that of its rival Rome. You will have noticed that I have evaded telling you exactly what the calculations are. There are a lot of Syrian popes at this time too, Syrian and Greek popes from the Eastern Mediterranean. Lots of intricate curlicues, complicated animals, magnificent contrasts of color, a kind of abstraction when you first look at it."
572,history,hist-210,lecture-13,"Professor Freedman discusses some of the paradoxes of monasticism in the Early Middle Ages. To the modern mind, monks and learning make a natural pair. However, this combination is not an obvious outcome of early monasticism, which emphasized asceticism and renunciation of the world. As it moved west, monasticism shifted away from its eremetic beginnings in Egypt and Syria to more communal way of life under the Rule of St Benedict.  In addition to communal life, the Rule emphasized prayer and labor; the latter of which was interpreted to include reading and eventually the copying of manuscripts. ","We’re going to talk about monasticism today. Because this is a society in which the spiritual, the military, the political, the economic, are not easily conceptually separated. These are things in which the sacred is conveyed from the spiritual world to laypeople via priests. But because priests are involved in the world, there are certain aspects of their differentiation from the world, and there’s a lot of debate in the Church at various times over whether that includes celibacy, not getting married. In the era that we’re dealing with, there are married priests, or there are priests who are more or less married. One of the problems about being a contemplative in the Christian tradition is as soon as you say something like, “Boy, I am really contemplating great today.” So from the beginning is the notion that the monks have to abandon everything, including self-satisfaction. Often, they live alone as hermits, but sometimes they live in communities. Where, you will recall, the emotional crisis that finally tipped Augustine over the edge into his conversion experience was hearing about the monks of Egypt from someone who had come to Milan and had been in Egypt, and described these men and actually women who were not well-educated, were certainly not trained in rhetoric, law, and the classics to the extent of Augustine. And this contrast is what decides Augustine to embrace a way of life that although not monastic and much more active in the world, is a renunciation of the standard career, the standard definitions of success in the Roman Empire, and involvement in the world in things like marriage, property owning, etc. Or Bede’s monastery of Jarrow in Northumbria, more remote. Or 500, or 2,000.So there is a symbiosis, to be cynical about it. Maybe they’ll stop believing in its spiritual energy. You have to subordinate your will to communal rituals and life. But labor is more interesting and innovative. It’s not just to train you into depending on other people. Because these are not just prayers like, “OK, I’m going to go in for five minutes and recite some prayers.” Different monasteries have different liturgies. But this is very impressive to the outside world. The closest thing to a monastery is a college, with some obvious differences. The quadrangle is like the cloister, focused in on itself. But it is no accident that this university looks a little bit like a monastery. People speak about the Yale bubble, but it’s supposed to be a bit of a bubble. And Benedict himself did not regard this as a primary duty of monks. We will develop it further in a few weeks."
573,history,hist-210,lecture-14,"In this lecture, Professor Freedman introduces Islam. He begins with a discussion of its geographical context: the dry desert lands of the Arabian peninsula. The Bedouins, or nomadic Arabs of the region, lived in a tribal society somewhat similar to the Germanic tribes discussed earlier in the course.  Their raids against the Byzantine and the Persian Empire, for lack of strong opposition, would lead to the Arab conquests. The second half of the lecture focuses on the life of Mohammed (570/580 – 632) and the early years of Islam. Mohammed’s revelation was one of the unity of God and a progressive interpretation of God’s prophets, with Mohammed as the last of these.  Early Islam was slow to differentiate itself for Christianity and Judaism, though this process accelerated after Mohammed’s flight to Medina in 622. Professor Freedman ends with a discussion of the tenets of Islam and anticipates the discussion of the Arab conquests in the next lecture.","And here we enter into a segment that, in a sense, is the most relevant, if relevance is a criterion, sort of is, to today’s world. One of the things that you’ll have noticed from the assignment is that the author, Berkey, emphasizes very much that Islam is slow in formation, that it’s not fully grown as this militant movement with a set of rules in 632, the year that Mohammed dies. Scholars are always writing against a prevailing interpretation. The only intrinsically favorable part of it is the southwest corner, modern Yemen. They had Christians, some of whom were Arabs, some of whom were not, and Jews, many of whom were also Arabs. They’re always frontiersmen or people inhabiting a land beyond a frontier. And his most powerful subordinates are quite capable of overthrowing him. And by Germanic king I mean not the kings that we’ve seen in the settled post-Roman, Merovingian empire, but the kings as described by Tacitus with possible greater or lesser accuracy. 620s AD may not seem like the full light of history, but Mohammed as a historical figure at least seems to emerge more clearly than Abraham or Moses or Jesus. There are formal biographies, called sira, S-I-R-A. The problem with these is they were written long after Mohammed’s death–a hundred years, at least. The Hegira is a key event in Islamic history. And it’s a little tricky to tell how much Mohammed would have known about Judaism and Christianity. And it’s also here that Mohammed perfects this notion as against the Christians and Jews who have scorned him that he is the Seal of the Prophets, the last of the prophets. And as you know, Islam expands great care to make sure that the human form does not appear in art. Great care is made in differentiating Mohammed from what Muslims see as the exaggerated stature of Jesus. People do not have pictures of him in their houses. In 632 he died, and what is remarkable is that the momentum he established was able to survive his demise. The tenets of Islam, just to close by way of our last remarks for the day. The other difference, more important, with Judaism is that Islam would be very quickly universal."
574,history,hist-210,lecture-15,"In this lecture, Professor Freedman discusses the Islamic conquests.  Although they were in some sense religiously motivated, Arab did not attempt to forcibly convert or eradicate Jews, Christians, or other non-Muslims.  The conquests began as raids, but quickly escalated when the invaders discovered that Byzantium and Persia were too weak to withstand their assault. In a relatively short period of time, the Arabs were able to conquer an area stretching from Spain to India.  Against this background of successful conquests, Islam began to experience deep internal divisions. These began as criticisms of the election of Mohammed’s successors, but broadened to criticize the Caliphate and the ruling family.  Out of this strife came the division between Sunni and Shiite Muslims. Professor Freedman concludes the lecture with observations on the increasingly non-Arab Muslim populations.","I know there’s a lot of new terminology, new narratives. It is particularly a problem in those countries such as Iraq, for example, that have both Sunni and Shiite populations. And so one of the things we have to talk about in a lecture entitled “Islamic Conquest and Civil War” is the origins of the split within Islam. Alexandria, capitol of Egypt at the time, surrendered in 642.We can list the factors that favor the Arab conquest, though they’re mostly sort of favorable soil, as it were, not the plant itself. We’ll just go back and then we’ll raid somewhere else. You have a certain amount of energy that is being expended in external fighting. And if you think about it, it is psychologically possible to be convinced that God is following you. So there are other rapid conquests in world history, and there are other rapid conquests by people who are technologically or culturally or certainly economically behind the people that they conquer. The Vikings, which we will end the course with, are certainly less developed, economically, less civilized, than the Carolingian Empire that they plunder. Why didn’t they just pillage these people?Some of it is just wisdom. Between them, the state and the Church held so much wealth, that the Arab conquerors didn’t really want to bother with mere private property. They received long leases for these lands from the Caliphate, and they paid a religious tax, a kind of tithe, as members of the , the religious community. It is simply that you as a person living in this polity pay this as a tax. In other words, in Egypt in 750, a majority of the population were Christian. And Ali, poor guy, presented himself yet again as the successor of Mohammed. So to some, especially the followers of Ali, Uthman appeared to be a representative of a not really staunch Islamic family. Lethargic and profligate, a lover of luxury, a monarch rather than a leader, a corrupt ruler. They reject the caliph because he’s illegitimate. But the rulership should be either elected or inspired. It may be the messiah of Jewish tradition. These people are known collectively as , singular, . It is, as we all know, an Islamic republic. Once you have started to talk about inspired religious leaders, they’re going to crop up even after you’ve declared an end of religious charisma. And the consequences of that and the splendor, nevertheless, of the Abbasid Empire will form our subject for the next lecture."
575,history,hist-210,lecture-16,"In this lecture, Professor Freedman discusses the Abbasid dynasty, which ruled the Islamic Caliphate beginning in 750. The Abbasids moved the capitol of the Caliphate to the newly-built city of Baghdad and created a state characterized by a strong administration and well-organized tax system. The state sponsored a cultural flowering, based in part on the translation of classical Greek and Roman texts. Professor Freedman ends the lecture by focusing on developments in mathematics and astronomy.","OK, in 743, civil war started within the Umayyad my family over the caliphal succession. And it makes sense that if it was in Persia, the largest non-Arab Muslim country, it makes sense that you would have the most  concentration of non-Arab Muslims, that is to say converts or the descendants of converts, who might feel that the egalitarian promises of Islam had been betrayed and that in fact the religion was an Arab one in which non-Arabs were in a subordinate position. So the Abbasids are not heroes, though they are an old family. They moved their capital from Damascus, the Umayyad capital, to a new city that they constructed in the desert, Baghdad. The Persian Empire was ruled from Ctesiphon. While most historians would not be quite as confident as Peter Brown, whom you’re reading for Wednesday is, that this represents the “Persianization” of the caliphate, it is certainly true that moving the capital to modern Iraq, to the Mesopotamian part of the former Persian Empire, orients the caliphate further to the East. Persia stands in the middle between India and the West. This is an empire more open to Eastern influences. Until the early tenth century, when the Abbasid caliphate starts to break up, the world of Islam was splendid, rich, cultivated, and scientifically progressive. And he escaped as far as he could go in the Muslim world, namely Spain. Thus the first independent Islamic kingdom, we can call it – although they don’t use that term – the first independent Islamic kingdom, independent of the caliphate, would be Spain. Land, above all, is the source of wealth in the kingdoms of Western Europe. In some cases, they got them from Byzantium, from Constantinople itself. So they translated things like Euclid on geometry, or the physician Dioscorides, who wrote, not the only, but the leading pharmaceutical manual. And so his influence would be tremendous in all three religions that we are concerned with: Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Now Aristotle is himself not much of a theist, that is to say, Aristotle doesn’t go on about God very much, and whatever God there is in Aristotle is not a personal god to whom you would pray on the assumption, or in the belief, that he was interested in your well-being. These are the Arab philosopher, known in the West as Averroes. I will say this: there are those who believe, wrongly in my opinion, that there’s always been this “clash of civilization”, as it’s sometimes called, between the progressive Christian West and the obscurantist Islamic East. I don’t accept that, in part for reasons you’ve just heard."
576,history,hist-210,lecture-17,"In the first half of this lecture,Professor Freedman continues the previous lecture’s discussion of the Abbasids. He highlights their ability to assimilate other cultures, before turning to their decline in the tenth century. In the second half of the lecture, Professor Freedman considers the seventh century, the crucial turning point in the history of early medieval Europe. The seventh century shaped medieval Europe; the period saw the rise of Islam and Northern Europe, fundamental changes in Byzantium, the reorientation of Persia, and the end of the secular elite in the west. Professor Freedman concludes with a few remarks on the Pirenne thesis, which states that the rise of Islam broke up the Mediterranean and paved the way for the rise of northern Europe.","So we had talked about the mathematical researches of the Arabs combining Persian, Greek, and Indian mathematics and, of course, with contributions of their own. And in this it resembles Chinese medicine, Indian Ayurvedic medicine, and indeed, at least conceptually, notions that people have of their own bodies. That the experience of illness or of mental distress is one of imbalance, of the predominance of one element over another. There are lots and lots of medical writings and doctors in the Islamic world. The observation obviously couldn’t be MRIs or CAT scans. This is partly a question of why does any civilization collapse. Because as you get bigger you develop more enemies. And where they are not dominant, Islam remains the dominant faith of places like Persia, modern Iran, and further east. Remember I said that there are three heirs to the Roman Empire– the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire, most obviously the Western kingdoms– and when we come to Charlemagne next week we’ll be talking about this much more aggressively– and the Islamic world. The development of such absolutely fundamental world historic things as state-sponsored Christianity, Islam, the ideas of political power in Europe as nations as opposed to the universal Roman Empire. In the traditional periodization 476 is then followed by something called the Dark Ages. The breaking apart of the Mediterranean into different regions. Although I’ve stressed the ties between Islam, Greece, Persia, between the northern and the southern Mediterranean, between Islamic Spain and Christian Spain, nevertheless, the conquest of the Arabs in the seventh century and the early eighth century create somewhat of a break up of what had been a united Mediterranean under the Romans. But already, this importance of Northern Europe is evident in some things we’ve been talking about. In fact, the seventh century is the era of the Byzantine Empire that most resembles the fifth century for the Western Roman Empire. As I’ve said, these emperors would call themselves the Roman emperor until the day the Turks penetrated the walls of Constantinople in 1453. But what this means is the end of this experiment in moving the seat of the Empire. There have been a tremendous traffic in religious ideas, as well. And this is reflected in the changing of the center of gravity of the Caliphate that we alluded to last time. That the Arab invasions cut off the different pieces of the Mediterranean and ended Mediterranean trade. But it is not part of the olive oil and wine-growing regions of the Mediterranean that we saw were what the Romans loved, and what they considered to be civilization. And next week we’re going to talk about the flowering of Byzantium, that is the height of this Eastern Roman Empire in terms of its political military power."
577,history,hist-210,lecture-18,"In this lecture, Professor Freedman surveys major trends in Byzantine history from the sixth to eleventh century, dividing the era into four periods.In the sixth century, under Justinian’s rule, the Byzantine Empire experienced a period of expansion (532-565).  However, the Empire was unable to hold on to Justinian’s hard won territories and so contracted for over a century of crisis that threatened its survival (565-717).  In the next period, (717-843), the Byzantine army was reorganized and the Empire was able to regain some lost territory.  At the same time, the empire was wracked by the conflicts accompanying theological controversies over artistic representations of the sacred (the Iconoclast controversy).  Finally, with the religious situation smoothed over, the Byzantine Empire was able to expand further from 843 to 1071.","So I hope you’re ready for the Byzantine Empire. This is an economic problem, a logistical problem, a resource problem, and even a cultural problem. Justinian formed his expanded empire, which is the first map in the handout. And to the degree that the Roman Empire was, as we with fatiguing repetition have said, a Mediterranean-centered empire, this empire of Justinian’s does a good job of restoring that Mediterranean orientation. On Wednesday, we’ll start talking again about Europe, northern Europe and the degree to which Charlemagne in particular it is a self-conscious heir to the Roman Empire. We don’t have a lot of written sources, for example. It is a militarized society, although as we’ll see, with more central governmental role. And it is a society in which culture is also somewhat restricted. And it worked– or at least certainly it looked like it worked. It’s a some sort of burning substance that explodes on impact and is useful to burn ships. And they are non-narrative; they don’t tell a story. It does seem to be a reaction to the crisis. The Western tradition would tend to separate out ruler of the state and ruler of doctrine. This is the way it’s normally taught, is that the emperor functions kind of like the Pope in the West. They succeed in imposing it for 120 years, off and on. But the emperors, even in the East, even where the emperor is so heavily involved in religion, have limitations on their ability to define doctrine. Constans was murdered in his bath in 668. This policy, against what one might expect, actually seems to work, to the extent that it does increase the population of these key frontier regions in the East with militarized forces transported from the Balkans. Diocletian’s reforms, indeed, the whole restructuring of the Empire in the late third century and early fourth century was oriented around increasing the size of the army– basically, doubling it– and figuring out a tax regime to pay for it. And it is, above all, whatever its exact nature, an innovation that works. They have differences already, however, that are visible in the ninth and tenth centuries. Think of Notre Dame of Paris and its sculptural program or Chartres or the Michelangelo and Bernini sacred sculptures. In Orthodox churches, you stand; there aren’t seats. The look of Orthodox worship, the look of the Russian churches, the icons, the gold, the imperial style is very closely related, self-consciously, to the model established by the Byzantine emperors."
578,history,hist-210,lecture-19,"In this lecture, Professor Freedmandiscusses the Carolingian dynasty from its origins through its culmination in the figure of Charlemagne. The Carolingians sought to overthrow the much weakened Merovingian dynasty by establishing their political legitimacy on three bases: war leadership, Christian rule, and the legacy of Rome.  Charlemagne’s grandfather Charles Martel won a major victory over the Muslims in 733 at the Battle of Poitiers. Charlemagne’s father Pepin the Short allied the Carolingians with the papacy at a time when the latter was looking for a new protector. Charlemagne, crowned emperor in Rome by Pope Leo III in 800, made strides in reestablishing the Roman Empire; although, being centered in northern Europe, his was not an exact imitation of the Roman Empire. Professor Freedman concludes the lecture with the observation that Charlemagne can be considered the founder of Europe as a political and cultural expression.","Today, ladies and gentlemen, we move back to Northern Europe to the northern part of the former Roman Empire. But it is a pretty convincing effort at the restoration of the Roman Empire, even though its base– in other words, where Charlemagne and his ancestors’ lands were, where their wealth came from, where they lived, where their followers came from– was at what had been the borders of the Roman Empire, what’s now northeastern France, Belgium, the Netherlands, west northwestern Germany– a territory known at this time as Austrasia. And of course, our word mayor applies to a municipal official. I mention this now because next week we’ll see this is a problem that Charlemagne’s descendants would have. But what is to be recalled is that, once you no longer have an official state apparatus with an administrative structure or bureaucracy like Diocletian, like Constantine, like Justinian, or even like those Byzantine emperors we were talking about, or like the Abbasid Caliphate– all of those are complex structures of state bureaucracies funded by taxation. Well, one possibility that Einhard, in effect, sort of encourages is that something happened to the family. You’ll remember that when we were talking about Clotar, the son of Clovis, that his men rebelled when he didn’t want to fight the Saxons. Obviously, Britain has a queen rather than a king and has for the last sixty years, but the favored candidate would be a male child. It is historians who impose that rational strategy. The Lombards, a barbarian tribe who had invaded Italy– we talked about them last time. They want to be sacred figures within the Christian world, to trump the pre-Christian aura of the Merovingians. And the pope, out of the Carolingians, wants protection from the Lombards and a sense of rule over most of Europe that will favor the Church and allow the Church to advance its work. There was an alliance between the mayors of the palace and monks such as the English monk, Saint Boniface, Apostle to the Germans. This is the battle in which the Arabs were defeated in northern France, and eventually retreated to Spain. Many of you are more advanced in science and genetics than me. He was desperate over the situation with the Lombards. Charlemagne is a man very much at home in his time. He conquered the Lombards in Italy in 774. In particular, he had hoped to take Saragossa. Charlemagne is tremendously successful as a war leader then. Charlemagne is, then in some sense, the reviver of the Roman Empire."
579,history,hist-210,lecture-1,"Professor Freedman introduces the major themes of the course: the crisis of the Roman Empire, the rise of Christianity, the threats from barbarian invasions, and the continuity of the Byzantine Empire.  At the beginning of the period covered in this course, the Roman Empire was centered politically, logistically, and culturally on the Mediterranean Sea. Remarkable for its size and longevity, the Empire was further marked by its tolerance. Although it contained an eclectic mix of peoples, the Empire was unified in part by a local elite with a shared language and customs.  In the third century these strengths were increasingly threatened by the Empire’s sheer size, its imbalances, both East-West and urban-rural, and by an army that realizes it could make and unmake emperors. Having set the scene, Professor Freedman looks to subsequent lectures where he will discuss reforms enacted to address these weaknesses.","So welcome to History 210, The Early Middle Ages. I try to have a reasonably structured lecture that doesn’t wander off too much. And, having said that, now you should just think it away. And this is part of the unique experience of teaching and learning at Yale, so don’t hesitate to ask me if you have any questions or concerns. The course pack is at TYCO, the photocopy place on Elm Street. And a long paper, which is due December 5th. Basically we begin in the Shire, and we end up in more dangerous territories. For the poor, the smooth functioning of the Roman government was less important than it was for the propertied classes. Rome was an imperial power, and, as I will say in a moment, it was an extraordinarily tolerant one. Like many great imperial powers, it assumed that there were certain areas of life that were optional. And we know, from contemporary times that, even with great communications, indeed, with instantaneous communications, it’s very hard to hold states together. In fact, it turns out that the problem is not so much the state– look at the great states of the mid-20th century: one no longer exists, the Soviet Union, and the other, the United States–whatever our strengths are–it doesn’t seem to be the extraordinary power of the central government, which is, in fact, much reduced from what is was in, say, 1950, by any measurement. The thing about the Roman Empire that is indisputable, and does not have a value judgment attached to it, is that it was enduring. Gibbon, in particular, emphasizes the tolerance of Rome, which appealed to his innate anti-clericalism. They wanted to control them, but they were beyond civilization. So a government official on the Danube, in what’s now Hungary, writes home complaining that, quote, “The inhabitants lead the most miserable of lives for they cultivate no olives and they drink no wine,” end of story. And we’re going to look at its two great crises. And that is the accomplishment of Diocletian, about whom you’re going to be reading. It seems to be so alien to everything Roman. All of these are manifestations of the long-term flaws I just mentioned."
580,history,hist-210,lecture-20,"In this lecture, Professor Freedman discusses the Carolingian Renaissance, the revival of learning sponsored by Charlemagne and his successors. The period before the Carolingians saw a decline in learning, evidenced in part by the loss of lay literacy. As literacy became the purview of clerics, monasteries set up scriptoria in order to copy manuscripts on a larger scale. In this context, the Carolingians sponsored a revival of learning both for the sake of bringing educated people into the government and in order to encourage the piety of the people.  Professor Freedman ends the lecture by discussing Einhard’s writings on Sts Marcellinus and Peter.  Their story illustrates how, in this period, the piety of the well-educated was not all that different from that of the common people.","I’ve put these names on the board because today we’re talking about the so-called Carolingian Renaissance, the revival of learning under Charlemagne and his successors. So I want to start out with the preservation of learning up to the point that Charlemagne really starts putting together this program around 780 AD.You’ll remember, and you will have seen from Augustine’s , among other things, that the ideal of Roman culture at the time of the Empire was cultivated leisure on the part of wealthy, well-educated lay people. And the Museum was actually closed by the emperor Caracalla in the third century. And in order to get at what it really means, what its real messages are, you have to know things like mathematics, astronomy, geometry, even music, and certainly grammar, rhetoric, and logic. The replication of this plan of Cassiodorus is the accomplishment of this period in which classical learning and its texts were endangered. Right?This is the period in which the Irish are critical to the preservation of learning. And of course, in Ireland, not part of the Roman Empire, they had no tradition of speaking Latin. So the triumph of the codex is roughly 400 AD to 2010. But intellectuals in the sense of promoting a program of liberal arts is unusual. By effective, I mean uniformity and discipline. For Livy, for example, there’s a lot of his incredibly long history that we don’t have. The fact that we have Tacitus at all is due basically to one manuscript. They also have, or copied, Livy’s fifth decade– that is part of Livy’s Roman history– the unique manuscript of the fifth decade, found in the Renaissance at Lorsch. So, for example, the Monastery of Reichenau, on an island in Lake Constance. In 846, it had 1,000.Well, all of this emphasis on education and classical learning is extremely important. And in Einhard, we see an example of an intellectual of this period and of this place. The implication is that Marcellinus and Peter want to move. And they even have the itinerary of the relics. The Carolingian Renaissance is mostly about an elite program to try to preserve elite forms of knowledge."
581,history,hist-210,lecture-21,"In this lecture, Professor Freedman discusses the crisis and decline of Charlemagne’s empire.  Increasingly faced with external threats – particularly the Viking invasions – the Carolingian Empire ultimately collapsed from internal causes, because its rulers were unable  effectively to manage such a large empire. In the absence of strong social infrastructure and an idea of loyalty to the ruler, government servants strove to make their positions hereditary and nobles sought to set up independent kingdoms. Although it only lasted for a short time, the Carolingian Empire helped shape the face of Europe, especially through the partitions of the Treaty of Verdun which created territories roughly equivalent to France and Germany.","So we’re going to talk today, now, about Carolingian decline. We always can see signs of decline coming after. One of the signs of things starting to unravel in the Carolingian Empire, so some historians say, is the death of Charlemagne’s elephant, which Einhard talks about, actually, in his biography; that is, it is an event that’s worth mentioning. This is the first person in the West claiming to be emperor, and the Byzantine Empire doesn’t like it. We’ve talked about this already, but since it’s a fairly complex idea, it’s worth emphasizing. In 806, he came up with the idea of dividing his realm among his three children. The count of Flanders, the count of Barcelona, the duke of Aquitaine, these are people who are starting to think of themselves as potentially, at least, rulers who might transmit their office to their children. And here I’m getting a little bit ahead of myself, but this is what’s going to happen once the Carolingian Empire dissolves, essentially. So the problems of Charlemagne’s empire– despite the invasions that will be our subject for Monday after Thanksgiving – the problems of Charlemagne’s empire are essentially internal, as was the case of the Roman Empire, only more so. My hesitation in using the word rules is that he is deposed once and forced to undergo public penance twice. Louis had very sophisticated ideas about imperial rule. Not only were his son’s restless, but his nephew had rebelled, been captured, been blinded, and died. The penance at Attigny resulted in his loss of prestige and a great increase in the power of the Church. And why is the spiritual superior to the material? What’s the problem with the pleasures of lust, from the killjoy, Plato’s  point of view? I won’t go into the complexities of this. And he’s known as Louis the German in part because his sphere of influence was the East, which we can start to call Germany. This is the most prestigious and, in some ways, richest part of the Empire. The same kind of ambiguity as to what are these territories. When Charles died, he was succeeded by several rulers in the West: Louis the Stammerer; Louis the Third, who had the good fortune of just being Louis the Third; and Carloman. So for example, they would be kings of France, with some minor interruption, until 987.In Germany, the family ends in 911, and a new series of dynasties comes into effect. But that, again, is not entirely new or entirely unknown in other historical periods and places."
582,history,hist-210,lecture-22,"In the first part of this lecture, Professor Freedman discusses the emergence of the  Vikings from Scandinavia in the ninth and tenth centuries.  The Vikings were highly adaptive, raiding (the Carolingian Empire), trading (Byzantium and the Caliphate) or settling (Greenland and Iceland) depending on local conditions. Through their wide-ranging travels, the Vikings created networks bringing into contact parts of the world that were previously either not connected or minimally so. Professor Freedman concludes the lecture, and the course, by considering what’s been accomplished between 284 and 1000. Although Europe in the year 1000 experienced many of the same problems as did the Roman Empire 284 where we began – population decline and lack of urbanization, among others – the end of the early Middle Ages also arguable heralds the emergence of Europe and Christendom as cultural constructs and sets the stage for the rise of the West.","It does seem as if we are back to invasions again. One thing that I’m sure Professor Frank will want you to get out of the Vikings course– and not all of you are going to take that, obviously, so I will mention this– is they did not have horned helmets. Different destinations: the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne for which they bear some responsibility for unraveling, Russia, the British Isles, Iceland, Greenland, the New World. And the Russians defeated the Swedes sufficiently in the early eighteenth so that they basically never got themselves very heavily involved in European politics again. So the other reason besides opportunity is tactics. And they’re also the founders of Russia, probably not to be advertised as the world’s oldest democracy. They also contribute to the destroying of the Carolingian Empire, the destroying of what we were discussing before the vacation. The Vikings seem to jockey between emphasizing raids on the Frankish Empire and on England, but basically they’re doing both. They start plundering cities that are not sufficiently fortified. But nevertheless, the Carolingians have no fleet to match the Viking ships. They are more French than anything else, although a bit different. Here you have to imagine or sort of visualize Scandinavia sitting on the top of Europe. From this vantage point then, the East would be a tempting source of enterprise for Vikings, particularly but not exclusively from Scandinavia, especially in the tenth century. And also, keep in mind, as is the case with Palm Beach and Miami Beach even as we speak now in late November, that for certain people, the prestige of the furs transcends any need for practical warmth. They were very attractive for hunting and for pasturing. So the colonization of Iceland begins in 870, and by 930, the island is basically full. These are very violent and until a certain point were taken to be realistic portrayals of life in Iceland just as if, say, 1950s and 1960s TV westerns were assumed to be a totally accurate portrayal of life everywhere in the United States in the nineteenth century. And then they get established incredibly rapidly and with surprisingly little effort, right? But suffice it to say that already in 1095, the European Christian population is capable of putting together an army to conquer Jerusalem from Islam, a seemingly impossible job, and certainly one that required more than logistics and resources but also a certain kind of if not fanaticism at least a real motivation, religious motivation. It is a much less Mediterranean-centered world. But this empire would endure until Napoleon, until 1804."
583,history,hist-210,lecture-2,"Professor Freedman outlines the problems facing the Roman Empire in the third century.  The Persian Sassanid dynasty in the East and various Germanic tribes in the West threatened the Empire as never before.  Internally, the Empire struggled with the problem of succession, an economy wracked by inflation, and the decline of the local elite which had once held it together.  Having considered these issues, Professor Freedman then moves on to the reforms enacted under Diocletian to stabilize the Empire. He attempted to solve the problem of succession by setting up a system of joint rule called the Tetrarchy, to stabilize the economy through tax reform, and to protect the frontiers through militarization. Although many of his policies failed–some within his lifetime–Diocletian nevertheless saved the Roman Empire from collapse.","I always find Labor Day particularly annoying, because I have a job where I can set my own schedule, and I don’t have a nine-to-five job. And to some extent, although heavily debated among historians to what extent, but to some extent, the cities may be said to have drained off the energy or been parasites to the productivity of the countryside. The climax of this is the Emperor Valerian was captured by the Persians in 260. But they considered those as bulwarks against a Germanic invasion across the Rhine. The major problem besides the invasions was succession. Many of them ruling for months; most of them being killed. One is what you would expect, and that is dynastic. And I mentioned that now, because we’ll see on Wednesday the result of this is will be the establishment of another capital, a second capital in the East, in what would be called Constantinople, modern Istanbul. Namely, barbarian invasions, just as the marginalization of Rome begins at this time. Men who are not particularly well-educated, who would have trouble recognizing a tag from Horace–there being no Internet just to look these quotes up. One of the reasons that the troops both raised up generals and then killed them, was that they tended to get a kind of reward from the new emperor– a thing called a donative. One measure of the effectiveness of a civilization is that is survives, and even people don’t comment very much on political instability. For many people, the fact that the government is polarized doesn’t really matter, in terms of their everyday life. And it’s a great advantage, up to a point. So up until the 1970s, the American currency was based on gold, and dollar bills were called silver certificates. The importance of this is something that I alluded to last time, and that is that the Empire could not be held together, really, by the government, however big the government was. They are, to some extent, ruined by taxation and increased taxation. Where, for example, military people who move around a lot are more important. And I emphasize this, not only because of these elites themselves and their role in holding the Empire together, but we’re going to talk about this when we talk about Christianity. Because when the local elites are ruined, so is local religion. He is, however, very typical of the military class of the Empire. Diocletian is responsible for the militarization of society. I don’t have a lot of people making a living off it. And that’s what’s happened with products that we’re familiar with in recent times. And in certain respects, his policies clearly failed. But basically, things are working; prosperity is restored to the people who had been prosperous before; the local elites have declined, but it’s not so visible as it had been. And we will see that Constantine, in some cases, completely revolutionizes things."
584,history,hist-210,lecture-3,"Professor Freedman examines how Christianity came to be the official religion of the Roman Empire. This process began seriously in 312, when the emperor Constantine converted after a divinely inspired victory at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge. Constantine’s conversion would have seemed foolish as a political strategy since Christianity represented a completely different system of values from that of the Roman state, but not only did it prove to be a brilliant storke in aid of Constantine’s quest for power, it fundamentally changed the character of the Empire and that of the early Church. Constantine also moved his capitol to a new city he founded in the East, named Constantinople, opening the possibility of a Roman Empire without Rome. Professor Freedman ends the lecture with a comparison of Diocletian and Constantine.","Today, we’re going to talk about what is arguably the most important event of the first part of our course, the conversion of Constantine, the Roman emperor, to Christianity. Diocletian, and as you’ll recall, had created this four man rule, the Tetrarchy, in order to divide what was perceived as an excessively large empire with an excessively large administrative structure. The young Constantine was sent east to serve the eastern Augustus, who succeeded Diocletian, Galerius. At this time, it took more literally than it would later the admonitions of Christ in the Gospels not to fight, not to hit back, not to engage oneself in the pursuit of worldly gain by means of violence. The Augustus of the East, Libanius, and Constantine, the Augustus of the West. He did not share Constantine’s bizarre enthusiasm, but all right. If he wanted to tolerate Christianity, this was fine. And this brings us to a crucial question, of course, that we’ll be discussing really throughout the semester, and that is what was the effect of Constantine’s conversion on the Church? And then the third group that held out were the intelligentsia, particularly of Roman and Athens, the people who had a substantial cultural investment in Greek and Roman philosophy, the intellectual side of the old elite. The Bosphorus is a narrow strait that separates Europe from Asia. Similarly, Constantine would get involved in controversies over the relationship between God, the Father, and Christ, the Son. On the other hand, because Constantine was able to solve neither the Donatist nor the Arian division, at least not definitively, and at least not yet, it shows how difficult it was for an emperor who could conquer all of his secular rivals, who could control this vast realm from Gibraltar to the Tigris and Euphrates, but couldn’t get a bunch of North African peasants to obey his orders about how to worship, or Egyptian priests either. Constantine favors the church, enacts legislation recommended by the church, favors the bishops, and even in the 320s, presides over the first ecumenical council of bishops of the Church called at Nicaea across the Bosporus from Constantinople, the Ecumenical Council of Nicaea called to deal with the Arian controversy. Because unlike many other religions– and certainly when we come to Islam, you’ll see the contrast– the political leader of the Roman Empire is not the designated leader of the religious practice of the Church because he is not a priest. And that is, of course, a crucial difference. On the other hand, even here there are some connections. From their point of view, the Empire had been restored. The barbarians had been pushed back behind the frontiers. And indeed, of course, the Empire would fail in the west within a century and a half or so of the embrace of Christianity."
585,history,hist-210,lecture-4,"The emperor Constantine’s conversion to Christianity brought  change to the Roman Empire as its population gradually abandoned the old religions in favor of Christianity. The reign of Julian the Apostate, a nephew of Constantine, saw the last serious attempt to restore civic polytheism as the official religion.  The Christian church of the fourth century was divided, however, by two serious heresies: Arianism and Donatism.  Religious dissent led to the intervention of the emperors at church councils and elsewhere. Professor Freedman then introduces St. Augustine’s , including an overview of Platonism.","Questions or problems?So today, this week, we begin to talk more seriously about religion. We’re only touching the surface, the proverbial tip of the iceberg, to use a cliché. Because we ought to be used to religious doctrines having military or other kinds of violent effects. I’d be glad to do this as a public service. This is a situation created by Constantine. In 410, as we will discuss next week, the city of Rome was pillaged and partly burned by the Visigoths, a–I hate to use the word “tribe,” but don’t tell anybody–tribe of barbarians who had entered the Empire across the Danube and the Balkans. This was a cataclysmic event, and it ushered in successive crises in the Western Empire that would lead to its collapse. And almost always, there were two emperors until the collapse of the Western Empire in the late fifth century. His failure shows the weakness of what we can call paganism or traditional Roman religion. He is a wonderful, if sad, example of an intellectual in power. And we’ve seen a little bit about these from the reading about Constantine for the first assignment, but let’s go over this. If you have studied Plato or were in DS and remember some of those key concepts, in Platonism, there’s the One, and then there’s the Demiurge. He’s the one who is out there creating the spirit as well as matter, creating the world and the universe, indeed, as we know it, while the One is at rest. Christianity or the Orthodox or Catholic view is that Christ and God are of the same substance. Now, Arianism appealed to people partly because they worried about the Trinity. And within Christianity, the evil god is the devil, or according to the Manicheans of this period that Augustine for a while joined, the god of the Old Testament. And then instinctively, what’s another problem, maybe, with it? So after defeating Licinius, he learned more about Arianism, which was strong in the East, and his first reaction was maybe your reaction, or certainly the reaction of anybody who’s more interested in power, politics, this world. It’s Augustine, particularly, who’s responsible for infant baptism. It is, therefore, a portrait of the mentality of a thinking person in the ancient world. This is described fairly well in Brown, beginning on page 73. Everything is good, but there are inferior goods."
586,history,hist-210,lecture-5,"Professor Freedman begins the lecture by considering the ways historians read the In this work, St. Augustine gives unique insight into the life of an intellectual mind in Late Antiquity, into the impact of Christianity on the Roman Empire, and into the problems of early Christianity. The three major doctrinal concerns of the early Church were the problem of evil, the soul-body distinction, and issues of sin and redemption.  In the St. Augustine searches for explanations of these problems first in Manichaeism, then (Neo)Platonism, and finally Christianity.Underlying this narrative are Augustine’s ideas of opposition to perfectionism, his exaltation of grace, and the notion of sin as indelible, not solvable.","Alright, so you may be asking yourself, “Why are we reading the ?” Second, the relation between body and soul. This can be summarized in terms of the importance of the humanities, even, or of philosophical investigation, as opposed to mere investigation of natural phenomena, in words that Augustine uses in Book X, which we have not read. It discusses time and the meaning of time. And indeed, Augustine doesn’t see these as separate, or to the degree that he does, it’s in a more complicated way than just saying intellectual versus non-intellectual. And I wouldn’t say that we all have had this experience, but maybe you–what was the point at which you discovered that you weren’t like other people, that they lived more for immediate sensations, or pleasure, or what Augustine would call debauchery, and you wanted to read or think about stuff or do lab experiments?I think the essence of Yale, if I understand it correctly, is I don’t have to choose between fun and the intellectual life. It is about spiritual yearning, but it is also about intellectual yearning for truth. But notice that he’s not just opposed to desire. But rhetoric is perhaps a little stranger to us. This is what Augustine is giving up in his conversion. So these two anxieties put Augustine in the camp of the Manicheans. But as is always the case with the statement, “everything that’s material is evil, but we are material,” Manicheanism also offers or affords you an opportunity to be completely involved in the world, totally involved in the world, because there’s nothing you can do about it. Many of you are familiar with the metaphor of the cave from . How would you describe their pre-pear-stealing state? And that’s what’s interesting about the pears. Now, the Augustine of the  is different than the Augustine of 20 years later when he wrote . And that’s the conceit of a lot of TV ideas, secret heroes. Tonight, I think I’ll have locust casserole.” Just because you are a connoisseur of art doesn’t make you a good person. Once again, if God judged people according to their merits, they would all be damned. The elect are people who are going to go to heaven. But this is implicit in what we’ve talked about today, because the bottom line is the Roman Empire is going to fall in the West, and the Church is not going to."
587,history,hist-210,lecture-6,"The Roman Empire in the West collapsed as a political entity in the fifth century although the Eastern part survived the crisis.. Professor Freedman considers this transformation through three main questions: Why did the West fall apart – because of the external pressure of invasions or the internal problems of institutional decline? Who were these invading barbarians? Finally, does this transformation mark a gradual shift or is it right to regard it as a cataclysmic end of civilization? Professor Freedman, as a moderate catastrophist, argues that this period marked the end of  civilization rather than the end of civilization in general.","Today we’re going to talk about the transformation of the Roman Empire. We aren’t even sure what so-called tribe he belonged to. Did it fall of its own accord or was it pushed, in other words?Question number two. And that’s what we’re going to talk about more on Wednesday, next class. Or is it merely a shift in power and the survival of Roman institutions such as the Church, while Roman political infrastructure– the emperor, the consoles, the praetorian prefects, and so forth– while that collapses?A medieval historian named Roger Collins in a book called     writes, “The fall of the Roman Empire in the west was not the disappearance of a civilization. Hence, the, if not end of trade, the radical diminution of trade. The bishops would now do things like ensure the food supply, rally the local population against barbarian invasions, educate the populace. They engage in some kind of public works, some kind of maintenance of order. In the case of Rome, there is no single definition of barbarian society. This may have to do with the population; it may have to do with the unattractive nature of military life, but nevertheless there was already, in the fourth century, a tendency to get the more familiar barbarians into the army as Roman soldiers. So in the 370s a group called the Visigoths asks to be admitted to the Roman Empire as an allied army. And indeed, both Adrianople the city, and Constantinople, the even greater city, would withstand Visigothic attempts to take them. And another aspect of that is that the army tended to be commanded now more and more by barbarian generals. This is a widespread myth of nomadic peoples. The one power of Italy willing to try to deal with Attila is the Bishop of Rome, whom we haven’t heard of yet, but we’re going to be hearing about him a lot. We have a saint’s life that is a biography of a saint, a man named– I’m sorry that I’m writing on the board so much today. At that moment the news arrived that the soldiers had been washed ashore by the current. Again, like Pope Leo, we have a member of the church, and in this case somebody that you would think was a recluse, indeed had been living like a recluse, nevertheless taking over the responsibilities for a population abandoned by its civilian government. And without that trade, cities could not survive. Somebody may decide in a few hundred years that the Dark Ages began in about 1950. Not a great movie, but—Patrick Leigh Fermor also wrote two books out of a projected three about walking from Holland to Constantinople or, Baghdad actually, I think, in the 1930s. What came to an end was a civilization, a certain kind of society. It has some heirs, however, like all dead entities."
588,history,hist-210,lecture-7,"In this lecture, Professor Freedman considers the various barbarian kingdoms that replaced the Western Roman Empire. Oringinally the Roman reaction to these invaders had been to accommodate them, often recruiting them for the Roman army and settling them on Roman land. Now, however, they were the rulers of the previously Roman lands of the West. These tribes included the Ostrogoths and Visigoths in Italy, the Franks in Gaul, and the Vandals in North Africa. As most sources about these groups come from the Roman perspective, it’s unclear how coherent each group was. In general, the barbarian groups characterized by disorganization, internal fighting and internecine feuds, and lack of economic development. Professor Freedman closes with some remarks on the Burgundian Code as evidence of barbarian society and institutions.","So last time we spoke about the collapse of the Roman Empire. Historians generally tend to make things look as if they had to happen. So in talking about both the Empire and the barbarians, I want to at least remind you that events could have gone other ways. This is relevant to talking about the barbarians and who they are. But we actually don’t find out that much about them. But also the author of a brief work called  about the German tribes. Tacitus portrays the Germans as kind of warlike. So we’re looking at the Burgundian Code – and there are other barbarian law codes – for clues as to how the society functioned. We’ll see this with the Bedouins in the desert, for example. And this is where things get kind of difficult, because we don’t really know how one clan considered another clan to be part of something larger. Ethnic identification becomes extremely important. Just because something is false, it does not necessarily lack historical importance. Or maybe one third  of just your regular old private revenues. I’ve given you two maps, one of which you’re not to show people who are not in the class. And you have little arrows that show their progress. I’m not sure what you’re supposed to do though, as a substitute. We know that the Visigoths were in the Balkans at the time of the battle of Adrianople in 278.(correction: 378) We know that they sacked Rome in 410. He scatters coins just like a newly appointed emperor. Boethius is a Christian and he wrote on Christian topics, but     interestingly enough, is a Stoical work, has very little explicitly about Christianity. So the fate of intellectuals in the Roman Empire is not necessarily so much better than the fate of intellectuals in the barbarian kingdoms. Theodoric is a great ruler, but he had a problem that is typical of many of these barbarian groups: He had to hold his minority together. But they were beleaguered by these Moorish groups, in other words native peoples of the North African desert. We don’t know very much about what’s going on in Britain at this time because more than Vandal North Africa, more than Ostrogothic Italy, the past is obliterated. We’re going to be talking about the Franks later, and we’re going to talk a little bit about the Burgundians in closing today. Is your brother going to have to kill me? Which is like a reversion back to the notion that the crime really injures not the state or the king or the peace that we all take for granted, but the individual who is affected."
589,history,hist-210,lecture-8,"Professor Freedman focuses on the question of how the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire survived, while the West collapsed in the fifth century. He begins with a brief overview of Procopius’  , a work which presents a highly critical account of the reign of the emperor Justinian. The more urbanized, economically stronger, and geographically more stable Eastern Empire was able to survive while the West was dismantled by barbarian tribes.  Yet under pressure from its old enemy, Persia, and new threats, the Slavs and Avars in the West and Arabs in the East, the Eastern Empire experienced a decline in the seventh century. Against the background of this political instability, Professor Freedman also discusses the Christological controversies of Nestorianism and Monophysitism which plagued the Church in the East. Beginning in the late seventh century, Iconoclasm also added to the pressures facing the Eastern Church and Empire.","All right, so today the question we’re going to deal with is the survival of the Roman Empire in the East. So while I’m saying that we are dealing with about four century’s worth of sieges and crises, there is this period in the sixth century, in the reign of Justinian, who represents a kind of brief, but very important, reconquest of the West. So our first concern is, how did the East survive the fifth century, which destroyed the Western Roman Empire? The East was easier to defend, especially, as I’ve just said, the position of Constantinople, both as an impregnable site and as a commercial city with very, very extensive trade, and as a base to defend the two core territories of the Empire. Other advantages of the East over the West–a bit richer, more urbanized, produced more taxable revenues than the West. It had an eastern frontier and it had a northern frontier, both of which were fragile. correction:  the nestorians emphasize Christ’s  nature; the Monophysites His divine nature].The beginning of this controversy is with the Nestorians, named after the patriarch, Nestorius, the bishop, Patriarch of Constantinople. So this is a problem that, logically, arises out of an understanding of who Christ is and what he does for humanity. The bucket of water representing the human part. If he’s divine, completely divine, then what’s the point of distinguishing him from God the Father? Gregory of Nyssa, himself a theologian, writes, about 500 AD or so, that the mood of theological controversy is so great, that if you go into a shop, and you ask about your change, he says, the shopkeeper philosophizes about the begotten and the unbegotten. And so Constantinople, far more powerful than Rome in the 450s–Rome, about to collapse completely–nevertheless, is beholden to Rome for, at least what would be the majority solution, to the problem of Monophysitism. And I’ll mention a couple of these compromises. As with–we saw as far back as Constantine, emperors trying to intervene to solve religious controversies, right?The  says, one of the Trinity was incarnate, and we’re not going to discuss it anymore. And they are extending their power as far west as North Africa and as far east as Afghanistan. So the fifth century is the story of the survival of the Eastern Roman Empire, despite these religious controversies. Across the city, on the Asian side of the Bosporus, are the Persians. So then, it is not a statue, but a painting. He would be the last emperor to visit Rome. These people, who decades before, had never seen a river that flowed all year long, who had no experience with the sea, for whom the desert was the sea. It is an example of this kind of very rapid adaptability that we’ll emphasize, when we come to talk about the Islamic invasion. And they also have certain doctrinal differences with the West."
590,history,hist-210,lecture-9,"Professor Freedman opens by discussing why historians use the writings of Procopius and Gregory of Tours, a sixth century bishop whose history of the Merovingian kings is discussed the following week. Procopius’s three works – , the adulatory , and the invective  – are the best sources on the reign of the Emperor Justinian. Under Justinian and his wife Theodora, the Roman Empire reached its height as it reclaimed territories in North Africa and Europe previously lost to the Vandals, Visigoths and Ostrogoths.. However, defeats in war accompanied by heavy taxation led to civil unrest. In addition to the wars, Justinian commissioned a number of large projects like the building of the Hagia Sophia and the organization of Roman law in the ","We are starting to use primary sources for our understanding of the historical periods under discussion. Procopius much more conscious of style, a layman, was somebody operating within the classical tradition. Or at least, it’s not the classical notions of rhetoric, smoothness, and vividness that Procopius has. Then we can say, sure, the eastern frontier turns out to be the point of vulnerability. If you get too big, you have to spend more money to defend yourself. In  , you can see that once the Italian war starts to go badly, Procopius’s opinion of Justinian and of the great general Belisarius tend to change from a kind of admiration and go, kill, get ‘em spirit to uneasiness, to blaming, to a kind of finger pointing. And he indeed is writing in that tradition. Both splendid and an extraordinary engineering feat. And these are important because Ravenna was outside the zone of territory controlled by the iconoclasts. Let’s set that aside for a moment and talk about what Justinian actually did. He did not have that awe-inspiring splendor of Diocletian or Constantine, for example. They, in fact, supported different factions in the circus. The Blues, anti-Monophysite; Justinian was a partisan of theirs. Justinian is reported by Procopius as being ready to flee. But Italy would take twenty years, not one. What wasn’t destroyed by the fifth century invasions– and remember we said the Ostrogoths were pretty reasonable occupiers– would be destroyed by the Romans themselves. The Ostrogothic resistance, however, proved to be much stronger than he expected. 540 is the year that Ravenna falls to the Byzantines, and it seems to be the zenith of Justinian’s reign. And this empire, stretching now from Sicily to the Persian frontier is clearly too big to hold onto. European, that is, as opposed to Anglo-American. Anglo-American law is a separate tradition. Procopius gives us, unreliable though he may be as to Justinian being a demon, et cetera, Procopius gives us a vivid picture of a highly-governed, even efficiently-governed, but oppressively-governed and very ambitious society. We are going to read from Gregory of Tours about Clovis and the Franks."
591,history,hist-234,lecture-10,"Asiatic cholera was the most dreaded disease of the nineteenth century. While its demographic impact could not compare to that of the bubonic plague, it nonetheless held a tremendous purchase on the European social imagination. One reason for the intense fear provoked by the disease was its symptoms: not only did cholera exact a degrading and painful toll on the human body, it also struck suddenly, and was capable of reducing the seemingly healthy in a period of hours. A second major reason for the disease’s significance was its overwhelming predilection for the poor: transmitted through the oral ingestion of fecal matter, cholera was intimately associated with poor diets and unsanitary living conditions. This correspondence qualifies it as an archetypical disease of poverty, and implicated cholera in the larger nineteenth-century political anxiety over the “social question.”","We can continue with our subject of Asiatic cholera. Cholera moved, I would argue, in the wake of revolution, rather than triggering it. So, cholera, if it didn’t cause the revolutions that marked the nineteenth century — there has been in recent literature a swing of the pendulum in a different direction, with a view sometimes expressed that cholera was dramatic, yes, but not a lasting influence on the history of the West after all. One was colonialism itself, which meant large-scale troop movements and increasing contact between the subcontinent and the outside world. Because, as I said, cholera doesn’t travel so well over extended periods of time, and it was the railroad, the steamship and, later in the century, the Suez Canal, that radically reduced the traveling time from the subcontinent to other parts of the world. This continues to be true with cholera in our own day. Cholera is, among many things, a disease of poverty. There was a big debate about whether cholera was contagious or not. And for people who thought that probably it was some chemical factor, if it was anything — that Snow’s biggest chance of making an argument was that it would be something chemical. But it’s important to realize that for a long time his writing was very far from convincing the international medical profession. And remember, in the nineteenth century, waste in European cities was predominantly thrown into the streets, where there would be a seepage downward into tank wells; that people would then drink the water and its bacterial bounty. And that I’m going to argue, the symptoms, the symptomatology, is an important factor in the social response to this dreadful disease, and it’s captured by such terms as “blue cholera,” “cholera asphyxia,” and “the monster.” And this meant that they often suffered from dire real illnesses, and those reduced the digestive time, and therefore deprived the stomach of its defensive capacity to protect you by the acidity of the digestive juices. But if the  gained access to the city’s water supply, then the disease would flare up with epidemic force, and this would be what the nineteenth century health authorities called epidemic cholera, instead of sporadic. This is partly because of the agonizing nature of the symptoms of this disease. And you can see King Cholera astride the globe. And again you can see the kind of terror that was associated with it. There was also a new strain on class relationships. Cholera was a class disease, I would argue, in that it caused a sharply unequal burden of death and suffering. During the time of cholera, however, doctors and priests moved among the most sordid slums, and yet mysteriously they managed to stay healthy, for the most part, while those around them fell ill and died. This is a depiction of the early outbreak. The results then were to maximize terror, economic disruption and flight. But I’m going to argue what were the long-term effects."
592,history,hist-234,lecture-11,"The sanitary movement was an approach to public health first developed in England in the 1830s and ’40s. With increasing industrialization and urbanization, the removal of filth from towns and cities became a major focus in the struggle against infectious diseases. As pioneered by Edwin Chadwick, the sanitary movement also embraced an explicit political objective, according to which urban cleansing took on a figurative as well as a literal sense, and was seen as a potential solution to the threat posed by the “dangerous classes.” European cities followed suit, with Paris and Naples embarking on wholesale rebuilding projects, necessitating large-scale state intervention. Although these technological reforms marked an undeniable step forward for public health, they often also entailed the exclusion of other strategies, such as progressive economic and educational reforms.","This morning we’ll take up one of the themes — that is to say, we’ve described how the course is about specific diseases, but it’s also about a number of overarching themes, and one of those is the development of various public health strategies. The result, along with those transformations, was a rise of new social tensions. It was state power that alone provided the wealth and organizational structures that were needed to carry out this enormous project. And the reformers were supported by Protestant and especially evangelical Christian churches. He was instead a lawyer by training from Manchester. And he was already well known, in particular for his reform of welfare provisions in Britain; that is, he was responsible in large part, for the passage, from the old poor law, which had provided relief as the birthright of every citizen in distress; that is, the right to some form of assistance or aid in time of distress. And his idea was to use public policy to cleanse the urban environment, but not to deal with other social and economic determinants of disease. The report is filled with descriptions of stench. But there’s no mystery at all in the causation. In this way, what Chadwick wanted to do, by analogy, was to use older people like control rods that would have the calming effect of preventing social meltdown and social revolution. The sanitary worldview led also on the continent to further offshoots, and that — I want to talk now about a continental form of the sanitary movement, the rebuilding of cities in their entirety. It was thought that this would also have an economic role. And you can see the intersection of these broad boulevards, and you can see how these were multi-purpose and would allow not only — part of the idea was the miasmatic one, that they would allow air and light to sweep through the city and remove the noxious smells, and purify and cleanse the city. We have to see this as an enormous sanitary success, but one that we ought to qualify. So, there are also political qualifications. Overcrowding was a cause of disease, and poisonous vapors arising from underneath the city poisoned the air, people breathed in the poison and succumbed to cholera, in Max Pettenkofer’s view. The purpose of  then was first of all to raise the level of the streets; that is to say, the danger and the miasma was, if we like, fermenting beneath the streets of the city. But unfortunately there too there were qualifications. And there was even a small coda to that, which is another outbreak, even in 1973."
593,history,hist-234,lecture-12,"There is a longstanding debate over the origins of syphilis, in which arguments over how the disease arrived in Europe have historically been linked to racist and xenophobic ideologies as well as to scientific and historical research. Whatever its provenance, the major syphilis epidemic of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries spread in the train of war, alongside Charles VIII of France’s armies. Syphilis was distinguished both by its catholicity, targeting kings as well as paupers, and its mode of transmission. The disease’s evident contagiousness served both as grist for a religious interpretation, emphasizing asceticism and divine punishment, and as a major challenge to the humoral theory of disease.","And what I want to do this morning is to be cognizant of the fact that you have, as you all know, the hour exam later this week. At the other extreme, when we come to it, we’ll see that influenza has a very high morbidity, but quite a low case fatality rate, and that’s related, I think, to the impact that that disease, influenza, has on society, which isn’t associated with such terror as say plague or cholera. If we look, for example, at cholera, one of the features, and a striking one, is that it was one of the most fulminant of diseases. And we’ll see that there’s an important Darwinian evolution that takes place, which is to say that the syphilis of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is quite different from syphilis thereafter. Among the venereal diseases — to use an older term — syphilis was king from the fifteenth century until the late twentieth, when there was the appearance of a much more threatening competitor, HIV/AIDS. A second idea that was very popular was that syphilis, instead of being of American or New World origins, was of Spanish or African origin. Then with the expulsion of the Jews in the 1490s, the disease was disseminated across Europe. Now, among those who propounded this view, there was clearly a current of racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia. Now, this work was odd, or unusual, in a number of respects. And, as I think about it, I can’t think at the moment of another poem about an epidemic disease. It also offered what I think we could say was a clearly moralizing, judgmental analysis of this disease as a scourge of God. So, in their anger, the gods afflicted Syphilis with this terrible pox. We can see that built into it, from the beginning, was the idea that syphilis was best understood as the wages of sin. The man who was punished was a pastor, not a priest; that is, possibly a Protestant leader. But this chancre heals spontaneously, just like lesions in chickenpox or herpes. The disease in fact persists, but for a time without generating symptoms. He was covered from head to foot in boils. There was a so-called general friction in which applications of mercury were made to the whole body. Sometimes it was administered internally. And it was possible to argue that it was the therapy, the treatment, that had been effective. We see these forty days appearing over and over: in quarantine; the forty day fasting; the regimen for mercury; the regimen for guaiac."
594,history,hist-234,lecture-13,"The debate between contagionists and anticontagionists over the transmission of infectious diseases played a major role in nineteenth-century medical discourse. On the one side were those who believed that diseases could be spread by infected material, perhaps including people and inanimate objects, and on the other those who subscribed to the more venerable miasmatic theory. Although the contagionist view would be substantially vindicated by Robert Koch’s germ theory of disease, it is important not to simply ignore the arguments put forward by the anticontagionists. Although these were based on science that has since been disproven, the concrete proposals put forward by scientists like Max von Pettenkofer marked a major step forward for public health policy. In particular, the anticontagionists’ emphasis on the environmental factors of disease control continues to provide an important lesson.","As you know, one of the long-term themes in our course has been intellectual history, and the impact of epidemic diseases on that. This is a debate then that really mattered in medical history. But what I’ll want to do is something a little more subtle, which is to notice that what triumphed wasn’t just disembodied truth, but also a worldview, and that when that worldview won out, there were some losses as well, that went with it. See, that’s what I suspected, actually no one had heard of Max van Pettenkofer. In other words, the debate centered on the diseases that were the most feared diseases of the nineteenth century, and so the debate was passionate because it concerned diseases that were extremely important. And the European powers were greatly divided as to whether they should defend themselves by quarantine, the great contagionist measure, or not. But an important thing to remember was that down to the 1890s, contagionism — and this may surprise you — was primarily the standpoint of popular culture, rather than of the medical elite. Most men of science regarded contagionism as a view held by the ignorant and the superstitious, and indeed the irony is that contagionism reached a nadir, in respectability, just before the work of Koch and Pasteur demonstrated its ultimate vitality. And here we have quarantine and the draconian measures that follow from that. So, Snow did everything that it was possible to do, purely on the basis of epidemiological evidence. And this — I should say that Pettenkofer was no less rigorous as an epidemiologist than John Snow. Also, as you know, Pettenkofer had been trained as a chemist, and he looked at the traditional idea that the cholera poison was some sort of chemical substance, and he argued that it was entirely improbable that a disease could be spread then in the manner postulated. But for Pettenkofer, the  itself, on its own, would never make you sick. He regarded it as harmless on its own, and as we’ll see in a moment, he carried out a famous auto-experiment in which he tried to demonstrate conclusively the truth of his view. It happens when the gets into the soil beneath a major city. So that we see the X factor involves the . Unsanitary urban conditions literally fed the . It needed air and porous soil in which to grow. It seemed to explain Neapolitan history, and it was his theories that were the very basis for the rebuilding project. The real issue was the massive quantity of water, of domestic, industrial or household waste, that carried fertilizer to the city soil, and there dread disease. He was an advisor to the Bavarian government, and he became president of the Bavarian Academy of Science. His theory was losing ground by 1892, when there was a major epidemic of cholera at Hamburg, in Germany, and Pettenkofer and Robert Koch were greatly at odds."
595,history,hist-234,lecture-14,"Although the development of the germ theory of disease in the latter half of the nineteenth century marks a major revolution in medical science, comparable to the discoveries of Galileo in astronomy or Darwin in biology, it cannot be reduced to the heroic efforts of a single researcher or group of researchers. Rather, a number of conceptual, technological and institutional preconditions made the germ theory possible. Among these, contagionism, microscopy and hospital medicine all played a major role. The germ theory of disease facilitated a wide range of scientific advances, including the isolation of pathogens, the creation of vaccines and the introduction of antiseptics in surgery.","And what we’ll be talking about this morning is the germ theory of disease. There was also, for a fourth precondition, a lonely, neglected pioneer, and that was a Hungarian gynecologist, who lived in Vienna, called Ignaz Phillip Semmelweis, whose crucial idea, which dates from the 1840s — Semmelweis noted that the infection rate in childbirth was much lower on obstetrical wards where women were delivered by midwives, rather than on wards where they were delivered by physicians. The immediate background to the germ theory of disease involved the dominant theory of the day, which was called the zymotic theory of disease; that is, that it was a form of ferment — a little bit like Pettenkofer had asserted — caused by some fermentation of decaying organic material. With regard to cholera, that we already examined, about which there was a debate, the idea was that cholera was imported from outside. That is, he sterilized a flask with a swan’s neck, and found that if the culture is boiled, and the flask prevents air from gaining access to it, then there was no development inside of organisms that we would call bacteria. That was one reason that spontaneous generation had led to so much excitement. Then came the 1880s, and Pasteur turned to another high profile disease, and that is rabies. Rabies was not a high impact disease, in terms of numbers of people it affected, but it was a disease of high drama, and one that was then, and still is, universally fatal. And Meister remained loyal for the rest of his life, to Pasteur. He developed the plate technique, using the Petri dish and solid culture, and he developed staining techniques for microscopy. First, the organism suspected as a pathogen must be found in all animals suffering from the disease. In other words, it has to be universally present where the disease is present. And lastly, the organism must be re-isolated from the experimentally infected animal. Koch’s microscopy had a number of immediate implications. But Koch didn’t pursue that particular interest. The paper that Koch presented in 1882 was one of the most dramatic and important moments in the history of medicine. This was an extraordinary period in medical science. There was blood loss, and there was septicemia. After 1866, it became a normal procedure. There were other innovations as well, that went with it. In literature, you’ll see that  is a metaphor — and this is often said — for repressed sexuality, in the Victorian Era. But what I want to argue is what’s been neglected so often — and I think it’s really important — is I want to argue that  is also an allegory of infectious disease; not a specific disease, but diseases like plague and cholera, that originated in Eastern Europe and traveled, just as Dracula did, by ship and by railroad; that they had Count Dracula’s goal of ravaging industrial cities, huge population centers like London."
596,history,hist-234,lecture-15,"The sub-discipline of tropical medicine furnishes a clear example of the socially constructed character of medical knowledge. Tropical diseases first enter medical discourse as a unique conceptual field and topic for specialization at the end of the 19th century, and the heyday of tropical medicine–from the 1890s to the First World War–corresponds to the golden age of Western colonialism in Africa and Asia. This correspondence was not accidental; tropical medicine both gave practical aid to colonial powers faced with unfamiliar disease environments and furnished a deeply Eurocentric view of disease well-suited to the ideology of colonial expansion. As a consequence of this approach, little attention was given to the social factors of disease (work conditions, poverty, malnutrition), and the health of native populations was largely ignored. Subsequent periods of research in tropical medicine have, with decolonization and infusions of money from American foundations, been obliged to confront the consequences stemming from the discipline’s formation as an instrument of colonial subjugation.","And, as you know, in our class one of the topics, or themes, that we’re considering is intellectual history. The discipline thus far has undergone three periods in its history. They were simply heightened versions of familiar maladies. We should also say that this idea of diseases of the tropics already did have embodied in it some troubling and important questions that had to do with a colonial or imperial and racial view of the world. And there was a work that was a foundational text for this new medical specialty, one of the most influential medical works of the whole of the nineteenth century, and one that had enormous influence on the relations of the metropolitan powers to their colonial dependencies. A first, as we said, was Britain’s position as a great colonial power. It argued that in the tropical world the chief problem — and we’re talking with the period down to World War I — the chief problem was to preserve the health of European settlers. At that time, he discovered something that was radically new. And in Manson’s great work malaria occupies the largest amount of space in the volume; the reasons being that it was a perfectly vector-transmitted disease, a perfect parasitic disease. And it was in the Western hemisphere too that yellow fever replaced malaria as the quintessential tropical disease. In fact, this period, the first period of tropical medicine, from 1890 to just after the First World War, was a time, one of the times, of the greatest epidemiological disasters in the tropical world, with virgin soil epidemics, like smallpox and measles, and the impact of what was called constructive imperialism. Now, vertical campaigns of public health targeted instead single diseases, and they were designed to protect, above all, Europeans against the most menacing epidemics. It meant also — another implication was perhaps what we might call selective historical amnesia. It was a justification and rationale for colonialism. Later we see a transformation in the discipline. And, so, the entire discipline, if we like, was transformed after World War II, and became something that no longer embodied a colonial position, and no longer embodied the idea that it was the bodies of Europeans that deserved privileged protection, rather than the health of indigenous peoples in other parts of the world."
597,history,hist-234,lecture-16,"Of all the diseases studied in this course, malaria has been responsible for the most human suffering. It has evolved alongside humans, and impacted human biology as well as civilization. In the former case, this impact is evident in genetic diseases like sickle-cell anemia which, while increasing vulnerability to a host of other illnesses, has the advantage of conferring substantial resistance to malaria. In social terms, malaria’s debilitating sequelae have resulted in a reciprocal cycle of poverty and infection, low productivity and the desertion of profitable land weakening societies’ ability to combat the disease and ultimately reinforcing a division between the global North (where malaria was eradicated following the Second World War) and the South, where the disease persists.","I’d like to welcome you back, and hope that you all had really good breaks. We’ll be talking this week about malaria, both today and on Wednesday. The relationship of human beings to malaria has been so close, and so extensive, that we could also say that we, as a species, and malaria, as a disease, have evolved together, and that the human genome bears the imprint of our experience with malaria. Good examples of that are a couple of genetic diseases that I’d like to mention, one that may be familiar to you also, one being sickle-cell anemia, a second being thalassemia, and a third being what’s called Duffy negativity. Malaria, it’s now believed, played a major part in the fall, for example, of the Roman Empire, when an epidemic of malaria led to the disruption of agriculture and the Roman Legions. Indeed, at the moment, one can say the statistics are extraordinary. At that stage — and here we’ll see one of the points about the plasmodia, is that it undergoes a series of morphological changes in becoming distinct stages in its life, both in the human body and in the body of the insect. Initially when it’s injected, it’s known as a sporazoite, and what it does next is it migrates, after just a few hours after inoculation — say you were bitten right now, within a few hours the plasmodia in your bloodstream would have migrated to your liver. These are of the — by electron microscope — of the actual rupturing of red blood cells, and the emergence, once gain, of the parasites that have just reproduced, returning to the open bloodstream. Well, that’s the story from the standpoint of the mosquito. After the incubation period, symptoms begin when the plasmodia have achieved a critical threshold number in the bloodstream. Destruction of the red blood cells also is a cause of profound anemia. It suppresses the immune system of the body, and therefore gives rise to complications, especially respiratory diseases; as I mentioned earlier, pneumonia, influenza and tuberculosis. Indeed, malaria and poverty are mutually reinforcing in a kind of vicious downward spiral. But malaria, in turn, then leads to further poverty. This is Ronald Ross, who was a British military physician working in India."
598,history,hist-234,lecture-17,"In the last decade of the nineteenth century, malariology emerged as the most prestigious and intellectually exciting field in the new discipline of tropical medicine. The disease’s complexity and resistance to conventional public health strategies posed a major challenge to doctors and scientists. Plague measures and social hygiene had no effect in curbing malaria, and the disease proved difficult to classify. The case of Italy, and the malaria eradication program of 1900-1962, furnished a model for other efforts across the world. In evaluating the Italian campaign, it is important to distinguish between valuable lessons and warnings for future efforts, and in particular to account for the diversity of strategies responsible for its success.","What I want to do this morning is first of all begin by recapitulating a couple of points that we made last time. We can understand also why another form of public health was useless. Places that are immaculately clean can be lethally infested with mosquitoes and the plasmodia that they bear. And this too, thus far, has proved unavailing with regard to malaria. And then also another feature, as I said, is that malaria is not a single disease. Well, I want to give an example of a particular place. And I’ve chosen Italy for particular reasons. It was also the international center of malariology from about 1900 until the Second World War. But for historians, this is the important one, because this is the one that shook Italians up and convinced them of the enormity of the problem in their country. Worse because of things like deforestation of the Apennines. It was also a time then of economic difficulties and crises, and malaria feeds on human misfortune, and it did so in the late nineteenth century. These are soldiers bivouacking after a battle, and I think you can imagine them being from non-malarial areas and not having resistance, and you can see that they are a wonderful feast for  mosquitoes, and the soldiers from non-malarial areas fell sick and died in enormous measures. By the end of the 1920s, Mussolini is fully in power, and he institutes some antimalarial measures that became extremely famous, and he’s often thought as a hero of the antimalarial movement because of what he did in this area — the Pontine Marshes — which is just outside of Rome, and you’ll be reading about that. Well then, part of fascism, however, you can’t understand it without its impetus to expansion and to war. And the Second World War, again, led to a major destruction and to devastation, repeating even a worse scale what had happened during the First World War. In other words, there’s a massive social uplift, if we like, that’s going along at the same time as the use of DDT."
599,history,hist-234,lecture-18,"An ancient disease, tuberculosis experienced a major upsurge in Western Europe in the nineteenth century, corresponding with increasing industrialization and urbanization. Poor air quality and cramped living conditions increased susceptibility to the disease. Tuberculosis also had a significant impact on European culture. In this respect, the modern career of the disease can be divided into two eras: the first associated with artistic romanticism and the idealized image of the beautiful and brilliant consumptive, the second, following the germ theory of disease, linking tuberculosis with social fears of poverty and contagion.","Our topic for this time, and next, is another of the really ancient diseases in our course, which is tuberculosis. One way of thinking of it might be in terms of its time frame. Perhaps one could think of it in terms of an epidemic that lasts for centuries, perhaps, or decades in the case of a body of a single patient, at times. And I’m hoping that these images won’t be overly distressing to anyone. Again, this is from Jacob Riis, a tenement in New York City. And you can see how tuberculosis would thrive in conditions like this. ”In an inspection in 1905, the New York State Superintendent of Prisons declared that Sing Sing Prison in particular — and here I’m quoting from the Superintendent of Prisons of New York State — he called it “a hotbed for the culture and spread of tuberculosis, that should be abandoned as unfit for human habitation.” And in every age there were spontaneous cures, or apparent cures. Keats, in fact, became an icon of the relationship of tuberculosis to the arts and to genius. Now, in the nineteenth century, physicians regarded the course of pulmonary disease as passing through three stages, as they saw it. And I want to argue that there are two great eras in the modern history of tuberculosis in which the disease was conceived or thought of quite differently, and without much relationship to the reality of the quality of the symptoms. ”Well, TB was explained primarily by internal causes, due to the inherited essence of the patients; his or her constitution, or in Laennec’s jargon, the patient’s diathesis, which caused him or her to be susceptible to the immediate factors that triggered the actual illness. One were what he called : melancholy, sorrow, despair, and again sexual excess. A first was the widespread experience of patients. Tuberculosis, after diagnosis, became a lifetime’s career. Let’s think, for example, of Anton Chekhov, who’s the man in the left, pictured here with Leo Tolstoy. His plays were all written in the period of his illness, and all subtly have invalidism as a hidden but unmentioned theme. There was bleeding and cupping, to release the noxious agents. Well, in the United States, tuberculosis was also thought to be the white plague, partly because it was popularly regarded as a disease that affected the white race and not African-Americans, who were thought to have a different affliction in the middle of the nineteenth century. And in Europe, it wasn’t associated in the popular mind with the working classes, and people remembered that aristocrats and artistic celebrities often contracted it. So, that’s what I want to talk about next time, which is the movement from the era of consumption to the era of tuberculosis."
600,history,hist-234,lecture-19,"The cultural transition from the romantic era of consumption to the era of tuberculosis derived not only from the germ theory of disease and the triumph of contagionism over anticontagionism, but also from political considerations. Worries over population decline and growing working-class militancy were aggravated by what now appeared to be a social disease, or a disease of poverty. One of the strategies deployed against the disease was the sanatorium, an institution which was capable both of instructing patients in contagionism and in imposing a practical quarantine. Although the development of effective chemotherapy in the 1940s raised hopes that tuberculosis might be globally eradicated, these have unfortunately proven to be overly optimistic. Factors such as poverty and population displacement continue to favor the disease’s spread today, particularly in the Third World.","You’ll remember that last time we talked about dividing tuberculosis into two major eras, in terms of the way that it was understood and experienced by human society. At the time, the theory of anticontagionism, that by now is familiar to all of you, was still dominant, and the tuberculosis patient was deemed to be, should we say, blameless and harmless, as he or she had a disease thought to be primarily hereditary. In addition, I would say that it was influenced by international politics; a gathering of international tensions, clashing imperialisms, with colonial expansion. But the movement then slowly gathered momentum towards the ends of the century, and then continued down to about the 1950s, when antibiotics led to the closing of the sanatoria, and for a time a euphoric view that tuberculosis was about to be eradicated; a view that unfortunately has turned out not to be the case. To his surprise, though, he recovered, and he attributed his improved health to fresh air, climate and rest. Expecting to die, instead he realized that he was starting to feel better, and he too attributed his recovery to this fresh air and rest; and he too felt that this was an experience that could be generalized. The first was what he called the wilderness cure, the one that he had experienced himself; that is to say, that you should live outdoors in all weather, taking the cure on cottage porches. Another point about the treatment regimen is that the sanatorium was what we might call a total institution. Trudeau himself was very optimistic that this institution had positive results for the health of his patients. In other words, this first American sanatorium was a work of philanthropy. Well, this went on as well — we can see a relationship between tuberculosis also and, should we say, economic development, in that the sanatorium became the centerpiece also for the development of a town — that is, Saranac Lake as a town — which was based on tuberculosis. And Edward Livingston Trudeau, in fact, was also the mayor of the town. So, in England the sanatoria instead practiced what was called graduated exercise, and instead of the rest treatment we have the work treatment. Well, at the British sanatoria, there were walks for the patients, and they were also color coded according to difficulty and how much it was going to make you breathe. The procedure was developed in the 1890s, and came into vogue after World War I, especially in this country. And this is a diagram of the pneumothorax apparatus. They also performed what we might call social work services. Spitting was really something that this campaign heavily focused on. It’s not known why it chooses to invade certain tissues and organs, rather than others. And it’s not entirely clear what were the factors that caused this major recession of the disease between the 1890s and 1985; although we’ve dealt with quite a number of them: spontaneous economic advance; improvement in living conditions; government and NGO campaigns; the reporting of the disease; the sanatorium movement; and then finally the development of antibiotics."
601,history,hist-234,lecture-1,"Epidemics, or high-impact infectious diseases, have had an historical impact equal to that of wars, revolutions and economic crises. This course looks at the various ways in which these diseases have affected societies in Europe and North America from 1600 to the present. Contrary to optimistic mid-twentieth-century predictions, epidemic diseases still pose a major threat to human well-being. Diseases will be considered not only in their biological effects, but also as social, political and cultural phenomena. Attention will therefore be given to the different forms of human response to epidemics, from medical science to artistic representations.","The first thing I want to say is that there’s a thesis to the course, that you don’t have to share, but that I’d like to test for the next twelve or thirteen weeks. Epidemics, in other words, have had an impact on history that I would regard as equal to that of revolutions, wars and economic crises. We won’t be examining occupational diseases such as miner’s lung or asbestosis. So, epidemic diseases are distinctive and have left a particular legacy in their wake. It would be perverse to discuss HIV/AIDS without paying attention to Africa, which is its place of origin, its epicenter, and the place where the disease is causing almost unimaginable burdens of suffering and loss. Indeed, one of our goals will be to examine major changes in medical thinking and philosophy. And we’ll also look at an unfortunate public health policy, by which I mean concealment, to hide the presence of disease, as China did during SARS, but following a long precedent in which other governments have a history of adopting similar policies; and we’ll be looking at that too. Then we’ll be looking at intellectual history. And familiar diseases have re-emerged in resistant and threatening manners, such as drug resistant tuberculosis or malaria, and other diseases as well. Defoe recounts the flight of the king and other authorities from London, in fear for their lives. And I’ll draw your attention, for example, to the early years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and we’ll think together about some possibly very troubling similarities. So, now you know where we’ll begin: on Wednesday with medical science, in its first but long-lasting embodiment, and the way that Europeans experienced plague, through the lens of humoral theory."
602,history,hist-234,lecture-20,"Reliable records of influenza, dating back to the 1700s, suggest a pattern of one major pandemic every century. Among the pandemics for which there is solid documentary evidence, the outbreak of 1918-1920 is by far the greatest. The so-called Spanish Lady caused somewhere between 25 and 100 million deaths worldwide. It is distinctive both for its high mortality rate, in comparison to other flu pandemics, and for its unusual demographic effect: whereas the flu typically targets the very young and old, the 1918-1920 epidemic struck adults in the prime of life. Without a cure for the disease, public health authorities today are in a position to learn from the successes and failures of the early-twentieth-century response.","Our topic this morning is influenza, which is timely for today. All of these changes are part of the success story of influenza as a disease, and there is no crossover immunity from one strain to another; acquired immunity, that is, is strain specific. And this may be the route by which human beings first contracted the disease, and it’s known that this, the animal reservoir, is a source of new strains. And I would submit to you that influenza is at the far end of that spectrum, in not really being a classic social disease. The reasons were that the world was prepared now for pandemic influenza, as a result of the transportation revolution — the railroad and the steamship — urbanization and trade, demographic growth and colonialism. Studies of 1889 to 1890 demonstrate this in more detail. And these tended not to be noticed; there was nothing particular about them that people noted at the time. In the nineteenth century, influenza, however, killed far more people than cholera, and a stark contrast then could be drawn. Flu seems to be quintessentially a contagious disease. So, therapy is supportive and symptomatic, rest and nursing care, more than active medical intervention. Well, against that background, let’s look more closely at the Spanish influenza — the Spanish Lady, the Spanish grippe, as it was called — from 1918 to 1920. A popular theory in circulation these days is that perhaps the Spanish Lady originated not in Spain at all, but in Kansas. Its mode of communication was identical to other flu pandemics, but its effects on both the individual and society were radically different. Wartime press censorship was partly a factor, but people were simply preoccupied with the war and not with the presence of a mild outbreak of a well-known and common disease. Armistice Day itself produced huge crowds and gatherings, which were not propitious for stopping the spread of the disease. Some physicians, on their first encounter, suspected that this was a kind of pneumonic plague. Let me read a passage from Katherine Anne Porter, the famous writer, , where she was herself a victim of the influenza. A thin frost touched the edges of this confident tranquility. Well, meanwhile, what happened with public health? You can see a picture of the properly masked police. Or you can see here another poster for public health."
603,history,hist-234,lecture-21,"The Tuskegee Syphilis Study, carried out in Macon, Alabama, from 1932 to 1972, is a notorious episode in the checkered history of medical experimentation. In one of the most economically disadvantaged parts of the U.S., researchers deceived a group of 399 black male syphilitics into participating in a study with no therapeutic value. These “volunteers” were not treated as patients, but rather as experimental subjects, or walking cadavers. Even after the development of penicillin, the Tuskegee group was denied effective treatment. Despite regularly published scholarly articles, forty years passed before there was any protest in the medical community. The aftereffects of the study, along with the suffering of its victims, include a series of congressional investigations, the drafting of medical ethics guidelines, and the establishment of independent review boards.","This morning I want in a way to circle back in time to cover an issue that’s been lurking in the background but we’ve never faced directly. You will remember that when we talked about the Paris School of Medicine, there was the ethical issue raised of the relationship of the patients to the physicians who were using them for medical studies, and we’ve talked about this as well in a variety of other contexts. It brings out the dangers of a military chain of command model of public health, in which no one questions or resists decisions from higher authority. Studies had revealed in connection with the social conditions of the sharecroppers in Macon County an overwhelming burden of disease and suffering. This is Tagliaferro Clark, and his idea was to have a scientific and racial curiosity. That was conducted in Scandinavia, and Dr. Clark thought that since the early study had involved a Nordic people, it would be really intriguing, really neat, to do a companion study to show the natural history of syphilis untreated in the body of the African-American male. For this reason, as the biomedical ethicist, Susan Lederer, explains, the real purpose of the study was not to treat the African-American men involved as subjects, or even as bodies, but rather as cadavers that had not yet died. So, there was an alternative, the experimenters thought, and that was a simple one: to keep a ready supply of serum available through regular blood samples from untreated syphilitic subjects. The problem was to recruit volunteers, volunteers to take part in a study that had no therapeutic purpose. They shuffled the deck between the study group and a control group. The first published report was in 1936, and papers were later written every four to six years or so, until 1970. The end came only in 1972, when a former employee of the Public Health Service, named Peter Buxton, reported this story to the Associated Press. Bad blood — you now know what that means. There would never be a benefit to those who took part. There was also, during the course of the experiment — there was also the idea in 1946 — there was an American Medical Association judiciary counsel that issued a report establishing the principle of voluntary consent. On the positive side, this established a legally binding ethical framework for biomedical research. There was harm in terms of a breakdown in trust between African-Americans on the one hand and the medical profession and the government on the other, and one can see the legacy of this is the HIV/AIDS pandemic that we’re coming to."
604,history,hist-234,lecture-22,"The global AIDS pandemic furnishes a case study for many of the themes addressed throughout the course. While in the developed West the disease largely afflicts concentrated high-risk groups such as intravenous drug users and the sexually promiscuous, in Southern Africa it is much more a generalized disease of poverty. In countries such as Botswana and Swaziland, the economic and social consequences of the disease have created a vicious circle, whereby the devastation wrought by AIDS severely impedes public health efforts and prepares the way for further infection. One important lesson that has been drawn from the past decades of struggle against the epidemic is therefore to take account of the specific, local characteristics of each affected area, making provision for the social as well as purely biological factors of transmission.","Our subject this morning, and next time, is the AIDS pandemic, and I’ll start this morning dealing — in a sense by popular demand, because I know from visiting sections that people were particularly concerned with bringing this study up to date and talking about where we are at the moment. Then there comes the period of active AIDS, where there are direct lesions caused by the retrovirus, carried in some cases to the brain. Sometimes other symptoms develop: difficulty swallowing, loss of memory, cough, shortness of breath, sometimes seizure, nausea or impaired vision. One can think also of unsafe blood supplies; blood that isn’t screened, and is supplied to people by people who are remunerated, thereby making every transfusion a risk for HIV transmission, for patients who have surgery, or for hemophiliacs. Meanwhile, worldwide the pandemic continues. Twenty-six percent of people are infected with HIV, the highest levels ever recorded, as are twenty percent of pregnant women. With nearly 6 million people living with HIV, in 2008, South Africa has the sad record of possessing the largest HIV epidemic in the world in absolute numbers, not though per capita. And as I said, violence against women is a major factor in the epidemic. But it’s no coincidence that southern Africa, where the pandemic is rampant, is also rapidly, rapidly urbanizing, and that indeed twenty percent of the global burden of HIV/AIDS falls on fifteen cities in southern Africa. The lesions that they cause, like genital ulcers, provide ideal portals for entry of HIV into the body. One can’t understand the AIDS epidemic without roads, railroads, the airplane. But in some cases they also have other priorities. There’s also the displacement of people, and HIV/AIDS thrives on migrant labor, on disrupted families, on refugee status. AIDS then leads to a vicious downward spiral in which poverty creates favorable conditions for AIDS. The fact that it destroys healthcare systems. And, so, the response has continually to be updated and adapted. Another stress has been on gender inequality. Let me then just contrast the situation in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic is, in the population, the general population, with a couple of other worrying places in the world — and I’ll end then on a slightly more somber note — some places that are currently sources of concern, outside of Africa. New infections, we can see, demonstrate that the epidemic has been transformed, and the epidemic in the United States is totally unlike what’s happening in Southern Africa."
605,history,hist-234,lecture-23,"Dr. Margaret Craven discusses HIV/AIDS from the perspective of a front-line clinician. AIDS is unprecedented in both the speed with which it spread across the globe and in the mobilization of efforts to control it. It is a disease of modernity. Along with the relative ease and velocity of modern transportation methods, other background conditions include Western medicine, with hypodermic needles and bloodbanking, intravenous drug use, and the development and concentration of gay culture. In the U.S., early public health attempts at understanding and combating the virus were hindered by right-wing domestic political and religious forces. Successful containment of epidemics cannot be achieved under the spell of hypocrisy and politicization; rather, medicine and education must be evidence-based and practical.","This morning we’re going to do something a little bit different, which is I thought that everyone was ready for a break. But it is spread the same way, through the intimate exchange of bodily fluids. I think you’ve heard about the Columbian Exchange. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere. To the great chagrin of reactionists, it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood, while old, established national industries have been destroyed, or are daily being destroyed. Syphilis, TB, cholera and the other bacteria diseases would be eliminated with antibiotics. He wrote a book about tracking down the source of cholera through the London water supply in 1849; you probably covered that in the course. Hooper agrees with Randy Shilts, who wrote the AIDS classic . This is a picture of a refugee camp that is right in that area where AIDS originated. Hooper finds extremely compelling the hypothesis that an oral polio vaccine, tested in Africa in 1958, in the very place that is now the epicenter of the disease, may have enabled the simian immunosuppressive virus to cross species from chimps to humans. IV drug use also preceded the arrival of HIV in New York at the Fourth of July celebration in 1976. Thus ghettos form, even without state decree. The immigration now made for a city in which two in five adult males were openly gay. In 1980, five to seven percent of the donated blood in San Francisco was given by gay men who did not know that they were HIV-positive. Of course, immigrant groups always have their seamier side of organized crime and commercial sex. Many of the strange things that happened in the bathhouses are perfect methods of transmitting every kind of infection; especially Hepatitis B, giardia, salmonella, and something brand new, HIV.And if you don’t know what the bathhouses are, I would recommend that you read Randy Shilt’s book and find out. Imagine reading it and instantly predicting the awful future. A few did eventually pay attention to him, luckily, and a year later Dr. Gallo, at the NCI was finally convinced that Dr. Francis was right, and dedicated a portion of his lab to the research. As you can see, it is he who is smiling, not Dr. Gallo. Hemophiliac children were prevented from attending school. But when Rock Hudson, a movie star icon of male charisma at the time, announced he had AIDS, and died of it in 1985, the American media and its adoring public finally decided we’d better get serious about all of this. He ended up writing a lot of the report by himself. Aside from Dr. Koop, however, the Reagan administration had two political agendas that could not have been more inimical to containing the epidemic. A heartrending and beautiful reminder of this is the AIDS Quilt, which is part of the Names Project. Wherever the next killer epidemic starts, like AIDS did in Africa, it won’t take long to infect the whole earth if governments insist on playing politics with the medical profession and public health institutions."
606,history,hist-234,lecture-24,"The Global Polio Eradication Initiative, the largest public health campaign ever launched, began in 1988 with the ambition of achieving its goal by the year 2000. In the decade since this deadline was missed, the initiative has suffered a number of setbacks, notably in the tropical world. Four major types of problems have impeded the eradication effort: operational, biological, political and religious. Northern Nigeria offers a case study of all of these factors, with domestic political and religious conflict, unsanitary conditions, and suspicion of Western medicine all undermining the anti-polio campaign. One of the questions raised by the campaign’s struggle is whether or not eradication is itself a realistic public health goal, and to what extent smallpox furnishes a model precedent or a potentially misleading dream scenario.","Today we’ll be discussing poliomyelitis, or polio for short. The acquired resistance is robust, produced by the body naturally. Or we can see this is a poster of the campaign against poliomyelitis. And a terrible picture, that was all too common in the thirties, forties and fifties, which is a whole ward of children in iron lungs. Until the 1890s, it was regarded as a minor medical and public health issue. That’s not to say that polio was an emerging disease of the 1890s, but I’m going to say that something new happened that transformed awareness of the disease. But something happened in the 1890s, and polio began to appear as something different, especially in the Western industrial world. Polio, in this sense, what John Paul called modern polio, seemed to be — if we could toy with a phrase that’s all too familiar to you by now — it seemed to be a kind of social disease in reverse. In other words, this was an illusion that it was only afflicting the industrial, clean world. And the evidence confirmed that paralytic poliomyelitis in the tropics was actually greater than in the developed world, at its height, but that it was unnoticed. And, in fact, a critical mistake was made that — and this mistake misled the public health community, researchers and medical science for a long period, from the 1920s or so, down to the 1950s — and this was to assume that the course of the disease in human beings was the same as that in monkeys. The corollary was that since the disease spread via the nervous system, rather than the bloodstream, there was no opportunity for antibodies to mount a defense, and therefore no possibility for developing a vaccine. And the campaign strategy, interestingly, was first devised in Fidel Castro’s Cuba, and the campaign strategy provided a context in which oral polio vaccine could be maximally effective. And this is a map of Nigeria, if you imagine the country, and that’s the state I want to talk about, the state of Kano in northern Nigeria. So, the result was a boycott of the anti-polio campaign, and it lasted until 2004, at which time Muslim operated laboratories in Indonesia agreed to supply vaccines to Nigeria, and other Muslim operated laboratories in India analyzed the vaccine previously supplied to Kano, and found it to be harmless, at which point prominent Muslim leaders around the world pressed their co-religionists in Nigeria to support the international effort. It turned out that polyvalent vaccines, for complicated reasons, weren’t so effective. This possibility wasn’t just theoretical. That would be — if I had time, I’d talk more about it."
607,history,hist-234,lecture-25,"SARS, avian influenza and swine flu are the first new diseases of the twenty-first century. They are all diseases of globalization, or diseases of modernity, and while relatively limited in their impact, they have offered dress-rehearsals for future epidemics. As information about SARS spread internationally in 2002, in spite of China’s campaign of silence, the global response had a curiously twofold character: on one hand, the mobilization of biologists and epidemiologists across national frontiers was rapid and unprecedented, while on the other hand, public health strategies on the ground were largely familiar from previous eras. If the spread of information and collaboration on international health regulations have been two positive aspects of public health response in the first decade of this century, more worrying questions have been raised concerning the production and distribution of drugs and the capacity of for-profit healthcare systems to cope with a major epidemic.","I wanted to begin with just a housekeeping item, which is that next Monday we’ll have the last class, if you want to call it that, but it will be completely different in that it will be a review session. It will really be — I’ll be in your hands, and that will be a class that would be helpful if you came with things that you wanted to discuss or things that you think that we should go into more. For today, instead, we’re going to talk about three, in fact, new diseases, that demonstrated once more that the post-World War II idea, the complacent assumption, that modern medical science and public health had the tools to protect society and to eradicate diseases one by one, when that illusion, fostered by the example of smallpox, and nearly by the near eradication of polio, was once again punctured, as it had been earlier by the emergence of HIV/AIDS. Finally, on the ninth of February, the Chinese Ministry of Health notified the World Health Organization of some three hundred and five cases in six municipalities in Southern China. X-rays revealed what was called atypical pneumonia, which was a somewhat confusing term because it had been used, until that time, for a different condition. And the disease, like airborne viral infections in general, seems to be an equal opportunity affliction that can pass to all classes of society, the young, the old, the healthy and those with preexisting conditions. In any case, the disease spread from Southern China and Guangdong Dong Province to its next epicenter, which was Hong Kong; which was particularly important because of population density and mass air travel, Hong Kong being one of the great hubs of the international air travel network. On the other hand, public health measures and treatment were rather old-fashioned, low-tech and traditional. But the public health measures were effective. There was economic impact, the collapse of tourism and the retail industry. The world was lucky and dodged a bullet with SARS, for a variety of fortuitous circumstances. One wonders what the result might have been had the earlier travelers, who spread SARS, gone to different destinations in resource-poor Third World cities. Often a pattern of influenza outbreaks has been to have a series of waves. It was true — and this was a worrying sign — that the disease took the world public health community by surprise. Especially important, as I’ve said, was the entry into force of the new set of international health regulations, and individual communities and countries now put into place advance planning, after SARS, with procedures before the next emergency. By the time of the swine flu outbreak, however, the lesson had been learned, and it was very impressive to note that this time around there was a coherent strategy; that everyone was kept informed throughout the course of events."
608,history,hist-234,lecture-26,"Professor Snowden describes the final exam, and takes questions from students.","As you know, this isn’t — there isn’t going to be a lecture this morning at all. And, so, you can work out how to budget your time, in that regard. The question was, do you need to bring in readings on the ID section? But if I asked you about, say, the Paris School of Medicine, that you didn’t actually have readings on, then it wouldn’t be necessarily. And, in fact, they’re really lasting impacts because we still have those pieces of epidemic art and literature to look back on, to see how they had impacts on society. And I think the reason you’re — if I’ve understood you, you’re saying that this should take us into another whole realm, which is to deal with the symptoms, because there was something particularly frightening and disgusting about Asiatic cholera, and that conditioned its impact. Anything else anyone wants to throw in on this question? We’re more vulnerable in certain ways, and less vulnerable in others. Maybe the mode of transmission is an important factor. We see that, in some cases, notably cholera, it did only strike the poor, and the rich were pretty much unaffected by the disease, in terms of health, health-wise. So, I think most diseases, even though some did strike the poor to a greater extent, you can’t classify them solely as being diseases of poverty. You’ve got lots of people to help you out. I think I would put malaria, and to a lesser extent than plague, on the cholera side of things. But I think that there is actually a sort of not poverty-based reason for that. I’m wondering if everyone would agree with that. When it was first introduced into the United States, for example, it wasn’t an example of socioeconomic marginality; but rather people who, because of sexual orientation, or through blood supplies and so forth. So, there’s the thought that maybe tuberculosis ought to be added to the influenza end of the spectrum, in that it seemed to be, looking back on the nineteenth-century experience of the disease, it was even described as a disease of beauty, of genius. Or shall I put it another way; are there major themes in our course? And examples that you gave — let’s see, quinine with regard to malaria, or later on DDT with regard to malaria, and has that — would that be — would malaria be a good example of a disease that’s been highly responsive to magic bullets? And people were thinking at that time that if we applied DDT for a certain amount of time, then malaria would be eradicated forever. The diseases tend to be much more complicated than to be simply amenable to a magic bullet solution. So, syphilis is another example, along with malaria. But having said that, another theme is stopping when we’ve run out of time."
609,history,hist-234,lecture-2,"The form of medicine that arose in fifth-century Greece, associated with the name of Hippocrates and later popularized by Galen, marked a major innovation in the treatment of disease. Unlike supernatural theories of disease, Hippocrates’ method involved seeking the causes of illness in natural factors. This method rested upon an analogy between the order of the universe and the composition of the body’s “humors.” Health, on this view, was a matter of achieving equilibrium between competing humoral forces. Although Hippocratic theory would later be challenged for a number of different reasons, notably including the experience of epidemic diseases, it persists today in various traditions of holistic medicine.","Without more ado, then, we’ll turn to our topic of the morning, which is about the first embodiment of a rational scientific medicine, which is rather an extraordinary one because it lasts from the fifth century B.C. down to the nineteenth century as a dominant — not exclusive — but a dominant medical scientific paradigm. There are memoranda of all sorts; writings on every form of medical practice at the time: surgery, obstetrics, diet, the environment, therapeutics. You can see this in many parts of our culture. Hear me Lord of the silver bow; bring to pass this wish I pray for. First he went after the mules and the circling hounds, then let go a tearing arrow against the men themselves and struck them. I don’t know if that was because they couldn’t stick the pace, or if the concept was wrong from the outset. This was in contrast to the supernatural divine and demonic theories, and it’s in contrast to them that we can see the importance of a new idea; the idea that disease instead is a naturalistic event that can be understood by natural causes. Men regard its nature and cause as divine, from ignorance and wonder. ”This was a very major breakthrough conceptually, the beginning of the foundation of a scientific medicine. Here I think the main part of the answer has to be imponderable factors such as the inspiration of Hippocrates himself, and his associates. The therapeutic principle was that opposites treat opposites. In some sense the Hippocratic physicians thought we are what we eat, and all foodstuffs had qualities — hot, cold, moist, dry — to balance an opposite defect or excess in the human body. Galen instead prided himself above all on his knowledge of the texts of Hippocrates. ”It was true also that Galen had an encyclopedic knowledge, and we can only understand his influence if we remember that he was a man of immense knowledge of all branches of the medicine that existed at his time. He was the person who perfected Hippocratic ideas. He was said to be a great patriot who saved Athens from the plague, a man who scorned money and was perfectly wise and perfectly just. Now, probably some of you are wondering — we’ve talked about humoralism and its advocates, and you want to know, “well, that’s all very fine; did it work?” I’d like to say that humoralism had a number of strengths. They did not participate in surgery except, for example, for setting bones, lancing abscesses and practicing venesection; but the internal cavities of the body they knew were off limits. Protestantism was a challenge, with a challenge to authority and established texts. This gave them a collective presence and authority, and Asclepius also vouched for their ethical conduct. So, this is humoral medicine, the first embodiment of scientific medicine."
610,history,hist-234,lecture-3,"The bubonic plague is the measure by which succeeding epidemics have long been measured. Its extreme virulence, horrible symptoms, and indiscriminate victim profile all contributed to making plague the archetypical worst-case scenario. For these same reasons, the plague is also an ideal test case for the thesis that epidemic diseases play a major role in shaping human history. Over the course of its three pandemics, the plague had major economic, religious, cultural and political implications for affected societies. In its wake, religious beliefs and medical practices were questioned, public authorities tested, and the social fabric strained.","Well, what we’ll do this morning is to start right now. And this fact, among others, made plague seem like an unnatural, or might we say supernatural, event. It also magnified the economic and social dislocations it caused. Another feature of plague we’ll be looking at is terror as a response to it. It was associated with scapegoating and witch-hunts, for the guilty people in society responsible for the disaster. Plague public health — and we’ll see this more next time — involved a military style policy carried out by the army and the navy. I would argue that plague also led sometimes to its opposite; the terrifying conclusion that how could there be a good God, because a loving and all-powerful being would not take the lives of half the population of a great city, indiscriminately killing men, women and children. Now, the humoral idea, and Hippocrates, had recognized the difficulty that epidemics pose for humoral theory. But let’s not think of Fracastoro as a modern medical scientist. And in addition to being cyclical in that sense, plague had a pronounced seasonality. But that provides an ideal environment for fleas, which are decisive in plague, and their need for warmth and humidity, for their eggs to hatch; and they become inactive in cold or very dry climate. It may well — and this is the common theory — have arrived aboard a Genoese merchant ship that had sailed from the Black Sea in the summer of 1347.In any case, Italy was the first land to be invaded by the disease; again, as I say, not by chance, because Italy was at the center of the trade routes of the Mediterranean, and therefore was always, at this time, permanently at risk. Florence in 1348, when the disease killed half the population — and that’s portrayed vividly in Boccaccio’s ; 1576 to 1577, Milan; 1630, again Milan — and there are two major plague works of literature: Manzoni’s novel , and his work  — 1656 in Naples; and 1665 and 1666 in London, which you’re reading about in Dafoe’s .Then for reasons we’re going to return to, the plague was vanquished in Western Europe between the end of the seventeenth century and the middle of the eighteenth. They hide in the shipments of wheat and are transported overland. And, so, the clothing of dead men and women was packed in crates, and sold in markets and fairs, often with fleas intact among their folds. And the study of the symptoms of the epidemics we study isn’t just a matter of ghoulish curiosity. This led — I want us to remember how dehumanizing the symptoms of plague were, and that’s tremendously important to the way that societies experienced its outbreak. They’re one disease in three separate manifestations. And pneumonic plague is also recorded in your favorite nursery rhyme. In regard whereof, it could not be otherwise, but that a countless multitude of men and women fell sick; finding no charity among their friends, except a very few, and were subject to the avarice of servants."
611,history,hist-234,lecture-4,"Community responses to the bubonic plague ranged from the flight of a privileged few to widespread panic and the persecution of foreigners and other stigmatized social groups. The suspicion of willful human agency in spreading the disease, identified with the work of poisoners, was a major source of anxiety. Mass religious revivals also accompanied the pandemic, with the emergence of new cults of saints and public forms of repentance. Official attempts to contain the second pandemic resulted in the first full-scale public health program, the plague regulations instituted by the Italian city-states, regulations that included military quarantines, compulsory burial, and imprisonment of the infected. It is unclear to what extent these measures, while representative of impressive technical and administrative advances, actually contributed to defeating the epidemic.","Last time, as you’ll remember, we talked about a general overview of the three pandemics, as well as the impact of the plague bacterium — which we have here, , the star of our show — on the individual human body. Panic and fear of sudden death led people to depart in haste. So, let me give you a different and also dramatic example. Every activity in Naples ceased at the time. There was general unemployment and universal hunger. And indeed one of the popular images of the plague in art was a black figure on horseback, one of the dread horsemen of the Apocalypse who had come on this final day of reckoning. Well, first they would fall on foul odors; and these were plentiful in an early modern city. That’s to keep people away, at a safe distance from you. Sin could be the abuse of food and drink; excessive sleep and idleness; immoderate, unnatural or sinful sex; or blasphemous religious practices and beliefs. It might fall also on infidels, religious dissenters, Jews and gypsies. The poisoning hysteria reinforced this idea, and there was often an hysteria that the poisoning and the atmosphere was not a natural event but a crime. Let me give two famous and notorious examples, a first and early one at Strasbourg in the fourteenth century, where rumor had it — you’ll remember in the fourteenth century, the Jews were cast out of the Iberian Peninsula, and the panicked fear was that they were carrying out a plot as vengeance to destroy Christian Europe by poisoning the wells of Christendom. The city of Milan in 1630 was at war with Spain, and to their misfortune, four hapless Spaniards were found in the city, just as plague was breaking out, and they were accused of starting it by spreading poisonous ointment on the doors of the houses of the city. So, there was a great vogue in this era of Saint Sebastian, who was invoked to help human beings to avoid the plague. There is a theme we’ll see next time of the dance of death, the so-called , of people being rounded up by the grim reaper. And this is the first form of organized public health, that eventually leads, by the late seventeenth and the early eighteenth centuries, to the first victory of human beings over a major infectious disease. And you can see the homes that are shut up and sealed, with people inside, are marked, that these are the homes of plague victims. This is a picture from the nineteenth century by Gros of “Napoleon in the Pest House of Jaffa.” And often they were drunk, as they consumed spirits to fortify their courage. And only at the end of forty days were goods shipped and passengers released to enter the city at will. And it might be said as well that occasionally the pope reinforced the physical sanitary cordon with a spiritual one; that is, threatening anyone who crossed the line with excommunication."
612,history,hist-234,lecture-5,"One of the major cultural consequences of the second plague pandemic was its effect on attitudes towards death and the “art of dying.” As a result both of its extreme virulence and the strictness of the measures imposed to combat it, plague significantly disrupted traditional customs of dealing with death. This disruption made itself felt not only in religious belief and burial practices but also in art, architecture and literature. European culture was profoundly shaped by the experience of the plague, as witnessed by the advent of symbols such as “vanitas” and the danse macabre in iconography, as well as the visual representations associated with the new cults of plague saints. The successful containment of the plague might be seen to have exercised a similarly powerful effect in shaping the philosophical project of the Enlightenment, in that the measures taken to ward off death gave material substance to theoretical claims of progress.","And with that, I’d like to turn to our subject for the morning, which is about the third — it’s the third in our series of lectures on bubonic plague, and I’d like to talk about the effects, or some of the effects, of bubonic plaque on European culture. But I want us to remember that when we’re talking about those effects, I’ll be trying to say it was the effects not only of plague itself as a disease, but also the impact of the organized reaction to plague, the anti-plague measures, and the sense that for the first time society had means that were effective, and could protect itself against this dreadful outside visitor. So this is a tremendously painful experience, and you can see the pain written in their faces, of Adam and Eve. So that, in a way, is a story of our course. Leading themes in this are themes of solidarity, dignity and community. Now, the seventeenth century, the time of Defoe’s great work, also witnessed in Britain the publication of the work of one of the most famous of all writers on the theme of , the art of dying; that was the extraordinary Anglican preacher and bishop, Jeremy Taylor, who lived from 1613 to 1667, and wrote two major works, both of which have gone through edition after edition, they were so popular and so influential. In times of epidemic diseases that swept populations, this fear of death was very pervasive. I wanted to move on though to this particular painting, one of the most important of the plague years. And this again is Poussin, whom you saw earlier telling you how to die properly, what the good death should look like, who should be there and all the rest. The story is from the First Book of Samuel in the Old Testament. A special reward to any of you who tell me what an emerod actually is. It is, then — again we can see it’s a representation in painting of plague as being a punishment for divine anger and for sin. And we can see the passerby holding his nose because of the stench of the victims and the fear of miasma. Or quite a terrifying picture by Micco Spadara, “The Plague of Naples in 1656.”While we look at this, let’s think of the reference that it’s making. And if you look at the details, I think it becomes all the more disturbing, the closer you look at it. You see the skeleton, the crossbones, the shovel and all the rest of it, all around the edges. You can see the skull and human achievements. A glorious mural from 1463, one of the glories of the Renaissance in Germany. Venice, as you know, because of its site in the Mediterranean, at the center of the trade routes, was scourged again and again by bubonic plague, and was the place that first devised the anti-plague measures. Here was a basis for a new faith in reason, and the creative potential of political power."
613,history,hist-234,lecture-6,"In the eighteenth century, smallpox succeeded plague as the most feared disease. The two maladies, however, are very different. While plague is a bacterial disease, smallpox is viral. Plague is spread by rats and fleas, smallpox is transmitted by contact and airborne inhalation. Unlike plague, smallpox can exist as an endemic as well as an epidemic disease. The dread of smallpox was a result of its agonizing and unpleasant symptoms, which, in the case of survival, often left victims permanently disfigured. Prior to the discovery and successful implementation of inoculation and vaccination regimes, a host of ineffective and often dangerous treatments were attempted, including bleeding, purging, and cauterization of affected areas.","I want to turn to the next topic, which marks a new unit in our course. Plague was associated with terror and social disruption, and in the New World we’ll see that it had an even more dramatic impact on the Native — smallpox did — on the Native American population. Their survival depends instead on invading living cells. In any case, what we need to know is that smallpox was caused by a virus, and a virus that has no animal reservoir. The disease was restricted entirely to human beings, and that will prove to be important in making it eventually a good candidate for eradication. Not everyone, of course, who is exposed is infected. Other examples are simply doorknobs, eating utensils, and so on. The disease is known to have afflicted Ancient Egypt. But we need to know that it’s from a comparative description of its characteristic lesions. The smallpox had small lesions and primarily affected children; at least in countries in which it was endemic. The patient tosses about continually, and cries out. On the cheek and forehead, the appearance is of severe sunburn, and indeed the sensation felt by the patient is of scalding pain or intense burning. The disease then moves on, by the fifth day of the rash, when fluid begins to accumulate in pockmarks, which are then raised and firm to the touch — so we’ll pass on — now called vesicles. And they’ve transformed from solid to blister-like fluid. At this point, the patient is almost totally unable to swallow or talk, and deteriorates slowly, being drowsy most of the time and restless at night. These areas are all painful, and contribute to the frightening appearance and the misery of the patient. Treatment, should a case appear today, would be largely supportive, depending above all on intensive nursing, to keep the lesions scrupulously clean, to prevent bedsores and to minimize the breakdown of the skin. Or the patient could be immersed in a hot bath. Light and fresh air, according to this therapeutic fashion, were deemed to be harmful, and the patient was kept in the dark, if possible, with minimal ventilation. After hearing of all of these treatments for smallpox, perhaps you’ll appreciate the work of Thomas Sydenham, in the seventeenth century, the so-called English Hippocrates, who decided that the wealthy and noble who received extensive attention and treatment for smallpox perished of the disease more frequently than the poor, who had no access to treatment."
614,history,hist-234,lecture-7,"It is not known for certain when smallpox first appeared in Europe; however, the disease reached its highpoint in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when it persisted as an endemic disease while periodically erupting as an epidemic. European literature testifies to the pervasiveness of smallpox, a disease that most would have had acquired in childhood. In the New World, the disease was experienced very differently. With no acquired immunities on the part of native populations, European explorers and colonists were responsible for devastating “virgin soil epidemics,” one consequence of which was to pave the way for the importation of African slaves. The first practical public health measure to effectively combat smallpox, inoculation and later vaccination, achieved notable success but was not free of flaws and controversy.","Now that we’ve discussed smallpox and its impact on the human body — its symptomatology — this morning I want to concentrate instead on the impact on history, and I want to concentrate on three aspects in particular. And, so, let’s begin with the impact of smallpox in Europe. The havoc of plague had been far more rapid. So, unwilling to put his fair complexion, and his even fairer hair, at risk, Lord Castlewood took to his heels, and he deserted his household for the duration. These were catastrophes that accompanied European expansion to the New World, Australia, New Zealand. That is to say that the European encounter with the New World brought about the large-scale exchange from one side of the Atlantic to the other, and in the reverse direction, of fauna and flora. But unfortunately for them, the kindness wasn’t reciprocal. But the encounter between the Europeans and the indigenous peoples of Hispaniola resulted in an extraordinary and terrifying die-off. Well, the plates at Amherst College in the 1960s looked like this, and they show Sir Jeffrey scourging the Indian population with a whip, on horseback. And she was preoccupied with smallpox, in part because her own beauty had been compromised by a severe attack of the disease, and she elected to protect her own children by having them inoculated, by the practice I’ve just described, while they were in Constantinople. But there are a couple of relevant factors that we could note. The infective matter also was made to enter the body through the skin, in a way that doesn’t happen in nature, and, for reasons that aren’t understood, attenuates the virulence of the virus. So, inoculation was simply not accessible to the poor. To understand what happened, we need to remember what we said last time; and that is that there were three species of the genus of orthopoxviruses: . The problems involved such things as he required, at the time, an arm-to-arm method, and this entailed the risk of spreading other diseases, in particular syphilis, while trying to present smallpox. This blindness on Jenner’s part discredited vaccination in some quarters, and was one factor — these various limitations then — for one of the most powerful mass movements of the nineteenth century, and one that’s still with us today, and that is the antivaccination movement. There were various sources of opposition. And from that time, the annual toll from smallpox began to plummet, despite the fact that the nineteenth century provided conditions that would have been favorable to promoting the disease: improved and speedy transport, with steamships, canals and the railroads; crowding with a population that was ever more mobile, massive growth and urbanization and large cities. And those changes and advances were reproduced across Europe and North America."
615,history,hist-234,lecture-8,"In the decades immediately following the French Revolution, Paris was at the center of a series of major developments in medical science, sometimes described as the transition from medieval to modern medicine. Although the innovations associated with the Paris School were in large part products of the ideological and institutional transformations brought on by the Revolution, they belong to a long list of challenges to the Galenic orthodoxy of “library medicine.” Successive scientists and physicians had questioned the exclusive commitment of medicine to interpreting ancient texts; in the hospitals of Paris, a new medical epistemology, focused on empirical observation and the diagnosis of specific diseases, was put into practice.","Okay, well good morning, and we can get underway. One of those is already taking shape, I hope, in your minds and in your section discussions, and that is the history of public health strategies; that is, ways in which societies organize to defend themselves against the incursions that we’re discussing. And you’ve also seen that smallpox brought about a second major style of public health, and that is vaccination, and clearly we’ll be returning to that as well. So, public health is a major theme of our class. We should remember that this had an importance for medical epistemology. In other words, for Galen there was a new understanding of medical epistemology. Knowledge was derived from considering the ancients, from a careful study of their texts. So, this was ultimately, then — Harvey’s discoveries were incompatible with the medical thinking of his time. It was a democratic process, and it rejected the cult of authority. Authority could be challenged by anyone’s observations and measurements. And there came to be, alongside the Galenic system, the idea of contagion instead, which was a non-humoral idea. Indeed, Fracastoro developed this strongly, and it gained a wide purchase in popular culture, and the search came to be for some agent responsible for epidemics, not humors, but perhaps a chemical. All of these were severe criticisms for the humoral system. But there was no new medical science that was robust enough to create a new medical practice. So, let’s look now, with that as the background, at this new incarnation of medical science, the Paris School of Medicine, which was a conceptual revolution in the understanding of disease. And I’m pointing it out to us because it’s impossible to understand the Paris School of Medicine and the new understanding of medical science without taking into account the great hospitals of Paris that were its site and were crucial in the development of its ideas. In some sense he was skipping over Galen and returning to Hippocrates. But the point I want to stress today was that in terms of medical philosophy he was a sensualist. Here we see a picture, very widespread on the Paris wards, where hundreds-of-thousands of leeches were imported monthly by these hospitals. But by mid-century, the dynamism of Paris was on the wane, and it had to do particularly with therapeutics."
616,history,hist-234,lecture-9,"Professor Snowden describes the historical detective work that went into the research and writing of  his study of the 1884 and 1911 epidemics of Asiatic cholera that struck Italy. The latter epidemic is of particular interest, because the official historiography of the disease has long confined its outbreaks in Western Europe to the nineteenth century. Through his investigation, Snowden discovered that there was in fact an epidemic on Italian shores in 1911, and that its absence from subsequent histories was the result of concerted efforts of concealment on the part of Italian and U.S. authorities. The story of this successful concealment sheds light not only on the history of Asiatic cholera in the early twentieth century, but also on more recent public health campaigns that have involved concealment, such as China’s response to the 2002 SARS epidemic.","And this morning will be a slightly different style of lecture. And, so, I let this medical project have a life of its own, and this is what eventually became my book. And I’m going to be arguing that it was scourged also in times that aren’t recorded in the standard historiography of the subject, and in particular in 1911. So, my next place to visit was the Cotugno Hospital of Infectious Diseases. So, what do you do next if you think there’s a major epidemic and you want to demonstrate its existence?The next thing that happened was that I had the idea that this was a time, in 1911, that was the height of mass emigration of Italians — that is, I’ve said that I had been studying the disappearance of the European peasantry and its transformation into workers or urban dwellers, and a part of that was the extraordinary story of Italian transoceanic migration, in large part to this country, but also to Australia and other places. What are the politics of concealment, and so on? And I was lucky then because I was interested in a physician called Leonard Rogers, who was one of the world’s experts in tropical medicine at the early years of the twentieth century. And it was he who in 1908  made a major discovery. So, having discovered that, there were attempts by physicians to replace the fluids intravenously. The first files on this that I discovered were in police records. And I think our newspapers rather misled us in leading us to believe that this was simply unique to China, something very unusual. And Italy had — this was the fiftieth anniversary of Italian unification, and there was a major fair with a grand U.S. pavilion, and Johnny was planning to visit; until, that is, he got a letter from his friend, the U.S. Surgeon General, who wrote to Johnny’s parents that this trip simply wasn’t on in the summer of 1911, because due to infectious diseases it wasn’t safe to visit Italy. And to destroy the festivities by putting them off, by warning the world that cholera was rampant in Italy at this time, would have had enormous economic repercussions for tourism, a major industry. And there was an opposition to this municipal government in Naples, which was using health as one of the complaints of the opposition parties. So, one of the features — and I think 1911 is a good example of what happens if you don’t provide information. A first thing that happened was that this disease spread through many provinces of Italy. Because the patients on the wards of the Cotugno Hospital, and elsewhere in Italy, were systematically denied what was then the best available international practice, which is the administration of rehydration therapy, as developed by Leonard Rogers, and Italian doctors weren’t allowed to know that this was the state-of-the-art and the way in which it was possible to save Italian lives, reducing mortality from fifty to fifteen percent, or something like that."
617,history,hist-251,lecture-10,"Professor Wrightson discusses the Elizabethan settlement of religion and the manner in which it was defended from both “Papist” and “Puritan” opponents. The settlement of religion achieved in 1559 (and enforced through the Act of Uniformity) restored the royal supremacy, but was in some respects deliberately ambiguous, combining moderately Protestant doctrine with traditional forms of worship and church government. It was designed to minimize the danger of religious conflict by appealing to traditionalists as well as convinced Protestants. From the 1570s, however, the settlement came under attack from both Catholics and Puritans (the “hotter sort of Protestants” dissatisfied with the limits of the Elizabethan reformation). Wrightson describes how both threats were countered and defeated, while the Church of England gradually became normalized and accepted by the population as a whole.","Well, as you know, in 1528 religious change had not been a significant issue in English politics. She was of course Anne Boleyn’s daughter, and as Anne Boleyn’s daughter it was in a sense her conception in December of 1532 that had finally precipitated the assertion of Henry VIII’s royal supremacy. She didn’t really disclose them, but unquestionably she identified herself with the Protestant cause. They blended the two together so that you could read it as you chose. And one could say that Elizabeth was winking at people too. She was the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. ”What she and her counselors wanted was order, outward conformity, stability, and in pursuit of those objectives the ambiguities of 1559 were in many ways advantageous and they could be developed. But her more Protestant bishops really wouldn’t stand for that and many rood screens were gradually dismantled throughout the kingdom in the course of the 1560s. So let’s look at the two groups who opposed in different ways the Elizabethan settlement and how their challenges were met. Her counselors were in a panic as she lay on her sick bed. At last there had been principled resistance to the Elizabeth settlement, at last there had been a lead from the papacy, but in a sense it was also a disaster for the average traditionalist in religion. They had to make a stand, like it or not. This seemed a demonstration from abroad of the risk of Catholic treachery. And that was especially true amongst the younger clergy who were emerging from the universities, now thoroughly trained in Protestant doctrine, and who were becoming, if anything, more emphatically Protestant even than those who had led the church in the later years of Edward VI.This younger generation were moving beyond the doctrinal position which had been established by Archbishop Cranmer in the early 1550s and was enshrined in the prayer book. The godly saw themselves as a beleaguered minority in a world that was dominated by the reprobate, the unregenerate. A form of activism which in a sense could give them greater assurance. For the most part, they did that work in relative obscurity, down in the many parishes of the kingdom. As a result, the Queen simply suspended him and the Archbishop of Canterbury himself was suspended from exercising his duties from 1577 through to his death in 1583.Well, at that point, Grindal’s death in 1583 could be said in a sense to symbolize the passing away of the first generation of Elizabethan bishops, many of them people who half sympathized with the desire for further reformation within the church, men who had been willing to serve, willing to bear with the Elizabethan compromise for the time being, but in their hearts would have liked to have seen more. In addition to which he was a firm disciplinarian, and in 1583 as a means of preventing further action on the part of Puritans Whitgift introduced what was known as the Three Articles to which each of the clergy was required to subscribe. Meanwhile, as the 1580s drew to a close, some of the leaders of Puritanism were dying away. The Catholic missionary priests concentrated their attention on politically significant people. Most of their work was done amongst the gentry, there was no real mission to the common people, and by 1603 the Church of England had something like two and a half million communicants while there were only some 8,000 to 9,000 known Catholic recusants, most of them members of the gentry or their immediate tenants sheltered under their protection. But perhaps that’s too harsh a judgment on people who have been nicely described as ‘parish Anglicans’ or ‘prayer book Anglicans’, building up a loyalty for the form of religion with which they were familiar."
618,history,hist-251,lecture-11,"In this lecture Professor Wrightson provides an overview of central political issues of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. He discusses the Queen’s personal character and identity-forming experiences (and the challenges posed by her gender), the manner in which she interacted with her political advisors (notably William Cecil) and addresses the foreign and domestic crises which impacted her rule (such as the ongoing threat posed by the claims of Mary, Queen of Scots to the English throne and England’s increasingly tense relationship with Spain). In particular, Professor Wrightson highlights the shifts in political culture which occurred during the period, as ideas concerning political participation and the role of institutions such as Parliament expanded. He introduces Patrick Collinson’s notion of the Elizabethan regime as something of a “monarchical republic,” with the Queen exercising power in cooperation with political stakeholders whose ideas about governance were informed by both their Protestant convictions and classical political principles.","Well, in retrospect, looking back from the perspective of the twenty-first century, the reign of Elizabeth I tends to shimmer in the historical imagination. But the situation was far from stable, far less stable than it had been under Henry VIII for example. Government would be conducted in her name and by her royal authority, but the general assumption was that she would soon marry appropriately and in the meantime the privy council would assert its role in running the country and Parliament would provide safeguards. I thank God I am endued with such qualities that if I were turned out of this realm in my petticoat I were able to live in any place in Christendom.” She was a monarch ordained by God and anointed at her coronation. This time, however, Cecil managed to persuade her because of the obvious threat, and in 1560 some English troops and ships were sent to aid the Scottish covenanters. So, that won a breathing space but it was only a short breathing space, because in December 1560 Francis II of France, the young king, husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, died, leaving Mary an eighteen year old widow. By 1566, she had fallen out of love disastrously with Lord Darnley. In a jealous rage he assisted in the murder of her secretary, David Rizzio, at one point; and in 1567 he was murdered by a group of Scottish lords acting, it was said, with the covert assistance of Queen Mary herself. They didn’t want to restore Mary, Queen of Scots to the Scottish throne, because the Scottish — power in Scotland was now in the hands of friendly Lords of the Congregation who had proceeded to bring up the young James as a Protestant. Indeed, already by 1572, after the first of these, some members of Parliament, some members of Elizabeth’s council, including even some of the bishops, were calling for Mary’s head in order to resolve this danger. When Parliament asked her to do so she vetoed the bill that was brought before her with the words “la reine s’avisera,” “the queen will think about it.” Initially of course people expected that Elizabeth would soon marry and that she would bear children, bear an heir. It didn’t happen of course, but it’s still quite extraordinary. Well, of course that term is something of an exaggeration. It’s rather being playful in putting it forward for the sake of argument, but it does make a very serious point about the changing structures of political life and about what the expanded, increasingly participating political nation was capable of conceiving of and even of doing; their capacity to act in defense of the state that they wanted with or without the Queen’s consent. But also that period saw heads gradually turning away from the aging Queen and towards the assumed, but as yet formerly undeclared successor, James VI of Scotland."
619,history,hist-251,lecture-12,"Professor Wrightson traces the major economic expansion of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Despite occasional crises of mortality, population levels rose steadily, particularly in urban areas. Increased population levels resulted in enhanced agricultural and industrial output. Professor Wrightson reviews the extension of the cultivated area, forms of agricultural improvement and trends in enclosure. He then examines urban growth, the expansion of traditional industries such as cloth-making, and the development of new ones such as coal production. He ends by discussing the intensification of internal commerce and the expansion in foreign trade which took place during the Despite economic expansion and a greatly increased national income, however, prices continued to rise, real wages remained depressed, and the problem of poverty appears to have grown.","For the last three weeks, then, we’ve been going through some of the major developments in terms of political and religious change in the course of the sixteenth century, and for the next three weeks we’ll be looking at other aspects of what was going on in the reign of Elizabeth and under the early Stuarts, dealing with a number of themes that run across from about 1560 to 1640 and then we’ll return to the political narrative. Between the 1520s and the 1640s, the population of England and Wales roughly doubled whereas in most European countries which — continental European countries — which have been studied the rise was something like 50%. And that this could happen at all is of course an indication that some kind of economic expansion was probably going on. Another thing they did was to drain waterlogged land and to reclaim it for agriculture. A lot of wasteland was plowed up and brought into cultivation. In the forest of Arden, for example, in Warwickshire an area which was previously largely an area of grazing in forest clearances  much of the forest was cleared and the land went over from meat production to arable and dairying. Sometimes that was by introducing technical changes in agricultural production. But in the early seventeenth century it picked up again and 40% more of the county was enclosed. By the 1630s, there were 50,000 people in the east London suburbs. So this single London suburban parish contained more people than most of the cities in other parts of the kingdom. He came to the conclusion — I’m quoting him — “let the mortality be what it will, this city repairs itself within two years.” It’s been calculated that in order to replace the numbers who died under these dreadful mortality conditions and to continue to grow in the way that it did London needed an average of 6,000 new people a year coming in to the city to replace its losses and grow. But manufacturing in other industries also extended well beyond the cities. They brought their expertise and they helped to revive and transform the cloth industries of those areas especially around Norwich and Colchester. Marks and Spencer’s gets a lot of stuff from Nottinghamshire and so on. By the 1630s, the patent had expired and it spread beyond London, became particularly established in villages in the west of England in the Gloucestershire area. There was also migration to certain rural areas which were becoming very densely populated, especially the manufacturing districts, and those densely populated areas of course exerted demand in their turn for the agricultural products of a more specialized agriculture. One can only imagine the massive amount of commercial activity which was going on. Whereas in 1500, then, a great deal of the marketing which had taken place in England was rather localized, with some longer distance flows going across the kingdom in particular commodities — cattle, cloth and so forth — by the early seventeenth century one gets a picture of a society which was ever more closely interconnected and integrated by market dealings and commercial transactions. They began doing so partly to look for new markets for English cloth, partly also to get direct access to the source of much desired imports which had previously been obtained from the Netherlands. So companies were founded with royal charters to trade to the Baltic in search of the furs, the grain of Poland, the timber products of Scandinavia, all of which had a place in England’s growing economy. Attempts to establish overall national income in this period are extremely dodgy, but a number of heroic economic historians have attempted to do it and you’ll find the estimates there in section eight of your table."
620,history,hist-251,lecture-13,"Professor Wrightson reviews the consequences of the economic and population changes discussed in the last lecture. While economic shifts allowed some members of English society, especially members of the gentry and the land-holding classes, to increase their wealth, they also (coupled with an expanding population and price inflation) resulted in the growth of poverty and vagrancy. Professor Wrightson discusses the relative wealth and economic pressures faced by various segments of the early modern population (providing specific examples) and suggests that, while society was becoming increasingly polarized between the poor and the wealthy, there was also a third group, the ‘middling sort,’ who were expanding in numbers and influence. Professor Wrightson concludes by touching on the rising levels of poverty in the period and government responses to it (culminating in the passage of the Poor Laws), as well as very real human element in these larger social and economic processes.","Well last time I was presenting a kind of panorama of economic expansion; on the whole, a very upbeat story. It helps to explain how the long population growth of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries was able to be sustained. In general, the income of the gentry and the nobility was expanding. To give you an idea of the kind of proportion of these people who might be in town, in 1632 King Charles I, in the circumstances of a harvest emergency, ordered the gentry to return to their estates to keep order and to see to the needs of local people. Those who had a big farm with a substantial surplus to market, were actually very well placed to benefit from rising prices and for the growth of the market for their products, be it food-stuff or agricultural raw materials. In the county of Essex, for example, here to the east of London, it was very commercially oriented. William Harrison, a clergyman who described all of this happening in the later years of Elizabeth’s reign, said that despite the fact that higher rents were being paid, many of the villagers in his area — the yeomen farmers are the ones he was thinking of — were able, he said “yet to find the means to obtain and achieve such furniture as heretofore hath been unpossible.” They could also put their money into other things: bigger dowries for their daughters so they could marry well. They might have a poor competitive position. Finding the capital to set up could be difficult. Pretty soon he owned land, he owned a ship, he became involved in the trade in tobacco and in the supply of goods needed by the colonists. If you’re interested in that kind of person and that kind of development, Robert Brenner’s book, , the first section is a splendid depiction of these shifts and developments in the last years of Elizabeth and under the early Stuarts. That made it a little more difficult to establish yourself as an independent master and a great many people had to be content with serving as skilled craftsmen working for others, whereas previously they might have hoped to become independent masters. Donald Woodward, in a very imaginative piece of research, worked out the price of foodstuffs; found the wages being paid to craftsmen of different kinds; and then figured out how many days you would need to work to feed husband, wife and three children. Well, much of the same was true of the industries of the countryside. And they gained their living most of the time, but he added that when trade was dead “they know not how to live. Agricultural intensification and a diversification of industry and urban growth all meant that there was more work for such people. One description that arrested me when reading this was: “a Northern man by his speech,” “high-colored,” “beard close-cut mingled with white hair,” “in a manner crazed. Very often historians talk about these decades, these generations at the turn of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, as witnessing a process of “social polarization” and there’s some obvious truth in that. In many ways, the social structure was rearticulating into a, sort of, three-part form. So we have the voice of economic individualism opposing Cecil. Under those statues, a full national system of poor relief was created, based upon compulsory local taxation at the level of the parish, administered by officers to be appointed in every parish. In the early seventeenth century, the rates of fertility that can be calculated from the parish registers of parishes show that marital fertility was falling quite sharply."
621,history,hist-251,lecture-14,"In this lecture, Professor Wrightson discusses witchcraft and magic. He begins with the context of magic beliefs in this period, introducing the “cunning folk” who had reputations as healers and were often consulted. He then considers the specific problem of witchcraft, the use of magic to do harm, and its identification by the late medieval church as a form of anti-Christian cult. He examines the distinctive nature of both witchcraft beliefs and the history of witchcraft prosecution in England (as compared with both Scotland and continental Europe), outlining the typical circumstances of a witchcraft accusation and what these might suggest about the rise and fall of concern with witchcraft. Finally he considers a number of unresolved problems in the history of witchcraft in England: the nature of the links between gender and witchcraft; the reasons behind the passage of the statutes defining witchcraft as a crime; and the exceptionally large number of trials conducted in the county of Essex.","Well, in 1921 a group of workmen working on the highway near the village of St. Osyth, which is here in Essex, in East Anglia, discovered a skeleton. In the first place, they often were appealed to for medical reasons. She was known as a healer in her village. And the key to why that was so is perhaps to be found in what the historian of the Spanish Inquisition, Henry Kamen, has described as a peculiarly horrible conjunction in European history, a conjunction he says between “popular superstition” on the one hand and “ecclesiastical fantasy” on the other, the fantasies of churchmen. It was also made a felony to consult with or to feed an evil spirit for any purpose. There’s no evidence that the authorities actually wanted a witch hunt. They came up one or two at a time and so forth. Well, all of this probably had its influence in the course of the decline of witchcraft prosecutions. When that happened someone would bring an accusation; other neighbors would chime in. Witchcraft accusations could arise in other contexts. Thomas and Macfarlane suggest, first of all, it was partly because of the loss of the protective magic which had been supplied by the medieval church. They might feel uncomfortable about that. Women were seen as being morally weaker, as more prone to temptation, as more likely to use occult means to revenge themselves upon their neighbors; spells were the weapons of the weak. The work of James Sharpe reveals how many of the suspicions that led to accusations actually arose in the female spheres of village life; they were often initiated by other women. Women themselves felt threatened by witchcraft and were deeply involved in identifying and accusing witches. And on the other hand many of the juries, universally male, who heard these cases, failed to believe them. Essex seems to be wholly unusual so far as one can tell. All of this, then, may have given peculiar publicity to witchcraft as a threat and what could be done about it. Ursula Kemp incidentally was one of the women tried in one of those group trials, the one of 1582.So to conclude: the whole issue of the history of witchcraft, why people were so concerned with it at a particular point in time, is clearly enormously complex. So then, I suspect that overall both the rise and the fall of witchcraft prosecution is best explained by the way in which the law first of all gave people, and then later took away from them, the opportunity to settle a particular kind of personal conflict through the use of the law and the prosecution of people to their deaths. The beliefs behind all of that were very ancient and they long continued, but the history of witchcraft is very much to do with the use of the criminal law in the way I’ve described."
622,history,hist-251,lecture-15,"In this lecture Professor Wrightson examines the problem of order in early modern society, focusing on crimes of violence and upon property crime. In examining violence, he notes the existence of special cases geographically (the borderlands) and socially (aristocratic violence) before looking at the lower (and gradually declining) levels of homicide in general. He then considers property crime, distinguishing the various categories of theft and the manner in which cases were brought to, and handled in, the courts. The late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries witnessed a peak in prosecution, but while the law could be harsh and bloody in meting out punishment, it was also characterized by discretionary extension of mercy. Interpretations of the use of such discretion are compared and assessed – as are the limits that existed on its use in a society that believed in the deterrent effect of “exemplary punishment.”","Well, we’ve looked at a number of ways in which the late Elizabethan and early seventeenth-century period was a rather anxious age, and one of the things that the authorities in Elizabethan England and under the early Stuarts were very generally concerned about was the problem of order, which naturally raises the question of just how disorderly society was at the turn of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. And today I want to approach that in one way by looking at two of the kinds of crime which provided much of the serious criminal activity dealt with by Elizabethan and early Stuart courts and which will help us to approach this general problem. So, for example, amongst the men who were accused in Northumberland in the 1580s and ’90s of reiving, or of slaying, used with — using swords, daggers or lances, we find, for example, Thomas Armstrong, known as “Geordy’s Tom.” We have William Ridley, known as ‘Slack Will.’ Well, that kind of aristocratic and gentry violence could be added to from all over the kingdom. Well, the special problems that were posed by both the geographical and the social peripheries were fully recognized by contemporary authorities, and the Tudor and early Stuart state did its best to try to deal with them. He wrote with enthusiasm to one of his friends in the south how he spent every day in the saddle pursuing people across the border. It heard complaints, alternative channels through which feuds could be settled. It summoned offenders before it to answer. All this was slow to affect behavior but perhaps significant in the long run in changing the expectations of what was tolerable behavior amongst the elite. And when you look at the court records it’s always property crimes which predominate in the evidence that survives. Grand larceny was clergyable though some offenses were considered so serious that clergy was not permitted: house breaking, burglary, highway robbery and some other offenses. In 1596 for example, one justice of the peace for Somerset said that in his opinion only about a fifth of the property offenses which were committed ever came before the courts; the rest went unprosecuted, largely because people didn’t consider it worth the time and trouble and charge of bringing a case over goods which were of low value. That’s certainly brought out vividly in years of bad harvest or trade depression. But even when they were actually brought before the courts there were various ways in which the full rigor of the law could be spared. They frequently indulged in the practice of reducing the valuation of the goods which had been stolen, so that a person would get a lesser conviction. The rest were permitted clergy and, since the levels of literacy were so low in this period that it seems highly unlikely that such a high proportion of felons could actually read, it’s perfectly clear that the magistrates and the judges were permitting any kind of stumbling through the neck verse, often from memory probably, in order to allow them to have this means of escaping the death penalty. In one of them, Douglas Hay has argued that this use of discretion was a quite calculated policy by the magistrates to balance the terror of the law with the practice of mercy, and by doing so to retain the gratitude and the deference of the poor. And she suggests that among such people there were certain shared ideals of justice, which meant that they tended to practice the gradual sifting out at various stages of the case of those whom they deemed to be truly culpable, truly criminal. A harshness greater than that that was later to be the case."
623,history,hist-251,lecture-16,"Professor Wrightson reviews the basic structures and aims of popular protest: notably food riots and agrarian disturbances. He notes that such disturbances were often surprisingly orderly affairs, rather than chaotic expressions of discontent. They aimed to defend traditional rights (rooted in custom) that participants felt were being threatened, either by food shortages or by agrarian changes such as enclosure. The forms taken by such events reveal a coherent moral order. Professor Wrightson reviews the tactics employed by protestors and the ways in which they constituted attempts to negotiate with authority. Official responses were often equally restrained, although the government was capable in some situations of displaying real severity. He concludes by noting that these forms of early modern popular protest were fundamentally political in nature, and that while agrarian resistance gradually subsided, these defenses of popular custom and rights influenced early forms of labor organization from the late seventeenth century onwards.","Let’s begin today with a few apparent paradoxes. The language they used to describe them says it all: the “meaner sort of people,” “the clowns,” “the ruder sort,” “the rabble.” Now whether that term is fully justified we’ll see, but the evidence at least reveals that the common people were neither unconditionally deferential to their rulers nor on the other hand were they secretly alienated from the existing social order, but rather, as one laboring man from Northamptonshire in the English Midlands put it on one of these occasions, they could — to quote him, they could “tell well enough how to devise a means to help themselves.” These riots also occurred in years of industrial depression when rural industrial workers in particular who were dependent upon the market for most of their food supplies found that they lacked the income to supply themselves because their employers were no longer able to put out work to them. They were almost entirely directed against corn dealers. Problems of that kind could provoke a great deal of local resentment. So these actions were aimed at rectifying quite specific forms of local grievance, a sense amongst local populations that they were being exploited by middlemen in the grain trade and abused. Sometimes the youth, or the women of the community, were to the fore in this action in order to evade severe punishment. The rising in the Midlands in 1607 started on May Day. And again, agrarian risings of this kind very rarely involved violence against people. As you know, in any individual manor, custom constituted a kind of local lived-in environment of norms and usages, a collection of rights which people believed to have existed “time out of mind to which the memory of no man is to the contrary,” in the phrase they often used; “time out of mind.” With that kind of conflict of interests, when push came to shove the notion of the sanctity and wisdom of custom strengthened the arm of those who tried to resist claims against local customs which were detrimental to their interests. Very often food riots were preceded by petitioning; petitioning the local magistrates to act to relieve distress and to put into operation scarcity regulations. That might include, for example, initial appeals to people who had set in motion enclosure schemes to desist and give them up. Or again there could be anonymous threats. Another form of action frequently taken was to initiate lawsuits. When people describe these actions as un-political what they seem to mean is that they involved no challenge to the authority of the state, and that they were not indicative of any revolutionary attempt to overthrow the established social order. They lost because the world that they — that they were trying to defend was gradually dissolving all around them. In all of these spheres new customs, the customs of the trade, were being established."
624,history,hist-251,lecture-17,"Professor Wrightson begins by assessing the state of education in the late medieval period and then discusses the two cultural forces (Renaissance humanism and the Reformation) which lie behind the educational expansion of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. While there were distinct hierarchies of learning in the period (with women and the lower orders having far fewer educational opportunities open to them than other members of the social order), this was genuinely a revolutionary period in terms of education. Attendance at the universities and the Inns of Court expanded exponentially, educational ideals for the elite were transformed, standards of clerical education reached unprecedented heights, grammar schools and petty schools were founded across the country and, by the end of the period, literacy levels in the population were much higher. England was now a partially literate society and was well on its way to achieving mass literacy. A threshold had been crossed, and this shift had far-reaching cultural and political effects.","Well, today I want to talk about changes in education and the growth of popular literacy in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, one of the most important sets of changes which were going on in the reign of Elizabeth and the — under the early Stuarts. First of all, there was the influence of renaissance humanism, affecting mainly the social elite. In 1537 he published a book called  which proved to be a great popularizer of humanist educational ideals. It was very important to learn to write a letter well. He was recruiting someone else to tutor the boy and he described the boy’s father’s desires as follows: “His father means not to have him a scholar by profession but only to be seasoned with the varnish of learning and piety.” It’s been described by one legal historian as “a formless, confused jumble of undigested particulars successfully resisting all efforts at simplification or systematic statement.” One student who came from Dorset, down in the southwest, a man with the wonderful name William Freke, who attended the Inns of Court in the early 1620s, has left behind a list of the books he bought during his years in London at the Inns and it’s very interesting. The sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries were a great age of school foundation. The universities, as we’ve seen, were also dominated by the gentry and the 50% or so of students who were of plebeian birth were not drawn from the poor. Interestingly, a study done of them shows that servitors and sizars working their way through almost invariably graduated, whereas the gentlemen they served of course very rarely did. You had to supply your own books and paper and pens and some families couldn’t afford this kind of thing. Children were often put to school at the age of five or six but taken away at the age of seven when they were able to play a more productive role in the family economy. What this indicates in general, studies of this kind, is that, in the course of the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, illiteracy amongst the social elite was completely wiped out; it was just eradicated. They would be educated at home by their mothers, by governesses, by the lady of the household if they were in honorable service in a great household, perhaps by the domestic chaplain of such a household. So the kind of education that gentlewomen were getting was restricted in its scope though there are a number of rare examples of individual girls who got a much fuller education including classical learning. The universities, of course, were closed to women. Again the transformation of the education at the level of the clergy is surely very significant. Literacy was now something that people would encounter much more frequently in many contexts of life, something they would use for many purposes. To give perhaps a silly example, I once worked on a village in the north of England, up near Newcastle on Tyne, where, in the late sixteenth century, every will surviving for that village was written by the local clergyman; he was the only one who could do it. If one thinks of late fifteenth-century society as one of heavily restricted literacy — restricted to certain social and occupational groups — by the early seventeenth century we have fairly widespread literacy; a partially literate society which was well on the road to mass literacy. Most readers of this stuff would not have been members of elite society, but they did have access to some of the issues and ideas of their day. One of the great collections of them which survives was put together by Samuel Pepys, Secretary to the Navy, a member of the highest-level bureaucracy of his day, but he enjoyed the cheap literature as well as the learned works that he had in his library."
625,history,hist-251,lecture-18,"Professor Wrightson reviews the conflicts which developed within the Church of England in the early seventeenth century and played a role in the growing tensions which led to the English civil wars. Wrightson begins by describing the “Jacobethan consensus” which largely prevailed throughout the reign of James I, characterized by broad-based conformity and adherence to Calvinist doctrine. However, this consensus was strained by the local activism of Puritans in many areas. The success of these Puritan efforts at local reformation was uneven across the country and largely depended on whether Puritan clerics were able to secure the support of secular magistrates in order to enforce godly discipline. He next considers the Arminian movement (anti-Calvinist in doctrine and with strong elements of ritualism and clericalism) which destroyed the Jacobethan consensus. He traces how the rise of Arminianism resulted in the polarization and politicization of religion with Charles I’s appointment of Arminian clerics (notably William Laud) to positions of control of the church and their repression of Puritan opponents.","Well, today we return to the main political and ecclesiastical narrative leading up to the — do you mind? — They were very conscious of the need to be able to communicate in that kind of way. And there were two of them in particular to emphasize. The Puritans, as we’ve already seen, were those that contemporaries thought of as, in the phrase of the time, the “hotter sort of Protestants.” Protestantism seemed to them to demand popular enlightenment. Richard Greenham, who was one of the most famous of the early Puritan preachers — he was the minister of Dry Drayton near Cambridge, a man much sought after for advice by other Puritans — Richard Greenham finally resigned his living at Dry Drayton after twenty years of effort, effort which had him not only preaching on Sundays and on weekdays but even going out and standing by the fields as his parishioners went out to work on their farms to talk to them about matters of religion and so forth. In short, they were prisoners of popular custom rather than followers of the precept of scripture. Well, such recommendations didn’t fall on deaf ears, and where godly ministers and like-minded local officers and magistrates supported one another, as they sometimes did, this kind of answer to the cultural failings of the reformation, its failings to adequately communicate with the people down in the parishes, led to what’s been characterized as widespread cultural conflict in the early seventeenth century, right down at the level of the locality. As a result, some communities became well known as models of godly discipline. Nevertheless, all agree that such conflict existed in many parishes, in many towns and it was all part and parcel of the local history of the reformation in its most advanced form. There was never a minister of Puritan persuasion, or a town council of Puritan persuasion, there to instigate such reformatory programs. The north and the west tended to see much less Puritan activity. But they had nothing whatever to do with the troubles of the Church of England. In 1630, Laud was appointed Chancellor of the University of Oxford with predictable results as regards theological teaching at Oxford. Between 1630 and 1632, when he was Bishop of London, Laud was extremely active in East Anglia, part of which fell under the bishopric of London, in rooting out Puritans, in calling them before him to be examined on their beliefs, in suspending them, indeed in ejecting them from the church. This again was anathema to Puritan ministers. Three of the most famous dissidents who smuggled in anti-Arminian books from the Netherlands to escape Laud’s censorship of the press, were arrested in 1637, ‘38, and severely punished by Laud acting from the Court of Star Chamber of which he was a leading member. There was widespread resentment and frustration amongst the godly folk who remained in English parishes that the reformation had been stopped, that perhaps it was being reversed before it had even been half won."
626,history,hist-251,lecture-19,"Professor Wrightson reviews the events leading up to the outbreak of the English civil wars and assesses the various historiographical interpretations that have been advanced to explain the war. He notes that while it is essential to appreciate the various long-term causes of the conflict, we must also recognize the role of contingency in the period leading up to the war. He then describes tensions between the crown and the political nation under James I and Charles I with particular attention to the role of the Duke of Buckingham, growing dissatisfaction with royal policy and the increasingly acrimonious tone of parliaments in the 1620s. The fresh start represented by the period of “personal rule” 1629-40 is then considered, with an emphasis on the anxiety aroused by royal financial expedients (notably Ship Money) and religious policy. He ends with the violent response to the attempt by Charles I and Laud to impose prayer book worship on the Scottish church, which triggered the collapse of Charles attempt to rule without calling parliament.","Well, I want to attend today to some of the political developments of the early seventeenth century. In the 1970s and 1980s, however, a more conservative, so-called ‘revisionist’ school of historians rejected these interpretations of the high road to civil war and began arguing that they were essentially the product of hindsight. We have to be alive to the importance in politics of contingent circumstances and the interventions of specific individuals. It was rather critical of the King’s use of his prerogative power to raise customs revenues by so-called ‘impositions’ on trade, and at the same time it was deeply suspicious of any financial innovation which might make the crown more independent of parliament. James was also ready to use his power to dissolve parliament when he became exasperated with it. So Buckingham came to provide something of a focus for deteriorating relations between the crown and the political nation. This occasioned massive anxiety in England followed by widespread public rejoicing when the marriage negotiations eventually fell through. Following that humiliation, in 1626 parliament met again to provide money for the war. This deteriorating situation finally came to a head in 1628 to ‘9. In January 1629, parliament reconvened and attempted to press its advantage. To those who sympathized with parliament and particular to the leaders of the House of Commons like Sir John Eliot or John Pym, the erosion of consensus was attributable to what they described as a popish plot amongst evil councilors of the crown who were hostile to English Protestantism and to the liberties of the subject and who were favorable to absolutism or arbitrary power in both church and state. Wentworth in particular was a man who had been vehemently opposed as a member of parliament to the Duke of Buckingham, but who recoiled in 1629 from what he took to be the excesses of parliament threatening the breakdown of order. In 1631, following a harvest crisis he issued a Book of Orders which tightened up the administration of local government with particular attention to the efficient enforcement of the poor laws and a great deal was achieved in that respect. Down in the counties local rulers usually obeyed royal commands when they received them. In 1633, Sir Robert Harley entered in his diary his prayers for a new parliament as well as his prayers for Protestant success in Europe and for the religious exiles in New England. But by the end of the 1630s he too had become convinced that there existed around the King what he described as a “malignant party” who “hate reformation and would bring in tyranny.”"
627,history,hist-251,lecture-1,"Professor Wrightson provides an introduction to the course. He briefly discusses the main features of the political and social landscape of early modern England and then summarizes the broad social and structural changes that occurred during the period. Professor Wrightson offers some thoughts on the nature of history and the study of history and focuses, in particular, on the benefits of studying the history of early modern England. He notes that the history of Britain in this period affected many other nations, such as early America and Canada, as well as later colonies such as those in Africa and India, and that studying these events helps us to better understand ourselves in time and contextualize many of the features of modern society that we take for granted.","So this is History 251, and this morning I want simply to introduce the class and to explain what it might offer to you. I could have called the course ‘Tudor and Stuart England’ and indeed that term is used in the subtitle. In introducing the political narrative, which will form part of the core of the course, I’ll certainly be looking at the lives and the times of the great figures who gave their names to the age, the faces on the coins you might say. Whether you imagine her as Cate Blanchett or as Judi Dench . He was born and died on September 3rd and also fought his two greatest battles on September 3rd, which is probably no coincidence. How did people make their livings and how did the economy change? One of them who is representing a cavalry regiment keeps interrupting the debate. And it’s thrilling because you hear for the first time the voice of the common people erupting into the councils of the nation. Since the 1960s in particular it’s been one of the most vigorous of historical traditions. Of course, all periods of history do that, but the events of the early modern period have a peculiar resonance. And if you start turning to other place names in Connecticut it just gets ridiculous. Same place names, they’re just in a different configuration and, in a sense, that’s symbolic of the relationship between British and early modern — early American history: same names, different configuration, slightly different meanings. To explore it is to explore part of your own identity. There’s a timeline running through the whole thing, but as it develops there are overlaps. In lectures ten and eleven, I’ll look at the England of Elizabeth I, focusing on the problems in religion and in government policy faced by the Queen, the struggle for stability in the immensely insecure environment which she inherited, and then in lectures twelve and thirteen I’ll go on to look at some of the principal features of social change under Elizabeth and the early Stuarts, looking at roughly the 1580s through to the 1630s, a period of major transition in society and economy."
628,history,hist-251,lecture-20,"Professor Wrightson begins his examination of the major events of the English Civil Wars which culminated ultimately with the defeat of the royalist forces and the execution of King Charles I in 1649. He describes how Charles was forced to end his personal rule and call a parliament in 1640 in order to defend England against invading Scottish armies. The events of the Short Parliament and the first sessions of the Long Parliament are examined, culminating in the outbreak of war in 1642. The composition of both royalist and parliamentarian support is discussed, followed by the war aims and strategies of the two sides and the campaigns and politics of 1642-44, leading eventually to the formation of the New Model Army under the leadership of Sir Thomas Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell. He concludes with the victory of parliamentary forces in 1645-1646.","The great political philosopher Thomas Hobbes — who, if you haven’t read you will be learning something about in the section reading this week — Thomas Hobbes formulated his theory of the state and his ideas on political obligation in the context of the civil wars which tore apart all three of the constituent kingdoms of Britain in the 1640s. He needed time for such opposition to die down; if it would. When the Short Parliament met late in April 1640 it immediately took up the old tactic from the 1620s of agreeing that they would vote the King money, but only if their grievances were first remedied, and indeed the very first speech made in the Short Parliament in the House of Commons declared that the Scottish rebels were less of a threat to the kingdom than the threat which was posed by the King’s government to the liberties of the subject. Indeed it’s been suggested that nationwide perhaps between a quarter and a third of all adult males voted in the election for the Long Parliament. Then in December 1640 parliament received, graciously, from the city of London a petition known as the Root and Branch Petition against episcopacy in the church and calling for further reformation in the church. The spring of 1641 also saw Strafford’s impeachment proceedings in the House of Lords which gradually turned into a trial of the entire regime of the 1630s, in particular the exercise by the King of forms of arbitrary power, with Strafford’s backing according to the allegations. It was a long document, a comprehensive indictment of Charles’ misrule ever since he had come to the throne in 1625; all of these points set out in order to justify the demand that henceforward parliament should have the power to choose the King’s councilors, thereby having control over whatever forces might be granted to the King, and that an assembly of divines should meet to determine the future structure of the Church of England to satisfy the Puritan zealots amongst Pym’s supporters. This seemed to confirm the theory that there were indeed “popular spirits” seeking to undermine the monarchy and the ancient constitution. He had the Grand Remonstrance printed and distributed outside parliament into the country to win support. Faced with this situation, Charles withdrew from his capital. Charles replied to this ultimatum that if he was to accept this — I’m quoting him — it would be “the total subversion of the fundamental laws and excellent constitution of this kingdom,” for, he continued, “parliament never was intended for any share in government or the choosing of them that governed.” In July 1642, parliament voted to raise an army. On the other side, some parliamentarians saw themselves as defending the ancient constitution and the law against a king who could not be trusted. And much of this was true also of the common people because they didn’t participate simply as dutiful tenants or impressed men. Amongst them we hear most in contemporary sources about a tendency to support parliament. They were people who had signed the county and municipal petitions which had been brought to the Long Parliament in 1640. But, be that as it may, they didn’t call the tune. The aims of the King and his advisers were simple. Secondly, they passed a Self-Denying Ordinance. They favored independency: congregationalism in church government. Achieving that victory, however, had released forces which could not easily be contained or pushed back into the bottle."
629,history,hist-251,lecture-21,"In this lecture Professor Wrightson considers the events leading to the execution of Charles I in 1649, and the republican regimes of 1649-60 (the Commonwealth and the Protectorate), with particular attention to the role of Oliver Cromwell. He begins with the unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a settlement with Charles I after the civil war, the intervention of the army in 1647 and the outbreak of the second civil war in 1648, which culminated in Pride’s Purge and the trial and execution of Chares I. He then considers Cromwell’s campaigns in 1649-51, his expulsion of the Rump Parliament in 1653, the nominated parliament of 1653 (Barebone’s Parliament) and the two phases of the Cromwellian Protectorate 1654-8, ending with the instability following Cromwell’s death and the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Professor Wrightson notes that although the Restoration marked the failure of the revolution, the political landscape had been irrevocably changed. The restored monarchy lived in the shadow of the civil war, the politicization of a large section of society was not reversed, religious dissent was now a permanent reality, and a plethora of new political and religious ideas had been advanced.","So, we’re in 1646 and, as I explained last time, the development of the war, especially between 1643 and ‘45, had unleashed forces which could not easily be controlled and created aims and expectations which had not originally existed at the outbreak of war, especially the controversy concerning the future organization of the church and the issue of ‘liberty of conscience’. Then on the 4 of June a junior officer, Cornet Joyce, went to Holmby House and seized the King and brought him to the army. Then, in late July 1647, demonstrations in London on behalf of Presbyterianism and against the army’s actions, led to the Independent members of parliament fleeing the city. Fairfax was a professional soldier, not a politician. In December 1647, the King, meanwhile, concluded an agreement with Scots representatives. On the 29th of April, 1648, they called the whole army to a general assembly at Windsor to the west of London for a prayer meeting before they divided into various bodies, each of which was to take on the Royalist threat in different areas of the kingdom. They saw the renewal of the war as being both a judgment from God upon their previous actions and a test of their resolve, and they resolved that Charles was “a man against whom God  hath witnessed” — I’m quoting from the declaration which ended the meeting — and therefore “that it was our duty if ever the Lord brought us back to peace to call Charles Stuart, that man of blood, to an account for that blood he hath shed and the mischief he hath done to his utmost against the Lord’s cause and people in these poor nations. ”The King with great dignity attended his trial in Westminster Hall but refused to recognize the authority of the court. So the fingerprints of these events are here. All writs were to run in the name not of the King but of the “keepers of the liberties of England.” So, by 1653, the Commonwealth was militarily triumphant. This was not the popular regime which had been envisaged by the Levellers. It was the brainchild of one of his officers, Major General Thomas Harrison. Cromwell was head of state with the title of Lord Protector. In May 1659, under pressure from the generals, Richard resigned, and the Rump Parliament was recalled. Thirdly, the Church of England could never again encompass the sheer diversity of English Protestantism. It resurfaced in the eighteenth century in the cabinet of curiosities of a gentleman, then vanished again for a while. Extensive forensic examination was done of the head to see if it was genuine. So if you go to Cambridge and visit Sidney Sussex College and go in to the chapel area where it’s probably buried you may be walking over Cromwell’s head. And he is there and the portrait has curtains and if a member of the royal family happens to visit Sidney Sussex, which happens from time to time, they draw the curtains across Cromwell’s portrait in order not to cause embarrassment."
630,history,hist-251,lecture-22,"In this lecture Professor Wrightson discusses the Restoration settlement of 1660 and the reigns of Charles II and James II. He highlights the manner in which tensions between the crown and the political nation slowly escalated during Charles’s reign (as a result of his attempts to grant religious toleration, unpopular wars against the Dutch and diplomatic alliances with France). Charles showed himself to be a shrewd politician and managed to contain these tensions, but the situation became increasingly fraught after the alleged “Popish Plot” precipitated the Exclusion Crisis of 1679-81 and the emergence of the Whig and Tory parties. Charles faced down the threat to his authority successfully. However, he was succeeded in 1685 by his openly Catholic brother James II, who proved politically inept and unable to build on Charles’ success. Fears of James’ catholicizing and absolutist intentions erupted in 1688 in the Glorious Revolution, when the Dutch leader William of Orange (husband of James’ daughter Mary) was invited to intervene, leading in James’ flight abroad and the offer of the crown to William and Mary.","Courtney has just pointed out that today is November 17, the significance of which had evaded me, but it’s the accession day of Elizabeth I,  which would have been greeted in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries with bell ringing and so forth. And then, if we turn to London, London appears to have had about a fifth of its population favoring dissent. He showed his courage during the great fire of London in 1666 when he joined in the firefighting. Samuel Pepys, Secretary of the Navy at this time, confided to his diary repeatedly his dissatisfaction with the manner in which the war had been conducted; his dissatisfaction with the way in which the King and his council would not attend to business as had been done under the previous regime. In 1677, when he had to call it again, it met and tried to make the voting of further taxes conditional upon Charles joining the Dutch-led alliance against France. There was also a growing sense of distance between the court and the country and a growing suspicion of the King’s intentions. Then there was the revelation in December 1678 in parliament, by an aggrieved former ambassador, of the secret clauses of the Treaty of Dover of 1670, which caused uproar. The Popish Plot precipitated what Jonathan Scott has described as the second great “crisis of popery and arbitrary power”; the Exclusion Crisis as it’s called, running from 1679 to 1681: Exclusion Crisis because it involved attempts by parliament to exclude James, Duke of York, heir to the throne, from the succession. Mass demonstrations took place in London calling for a new parliament. There was a real basis of popular concern which Shaftesbury and his friends successfully mobilized. This one’s usually known as the Second Exclusion Parliament. In March 1681, the Oxford Parliament met, again in an atmosphere of tremendous public agitation. He had consolidated his position by appealing to the fears and the prejudices of the Tory-Anglican majority amongst the political nation at large, and he had demonstrated that a Protestant authoritarianism was not necessarily unacceptable to those people. Not impossible, but we’ll never know, because if Charles II had had a lot in common with his grandfather, James I, James II proved to be rather closer in temperament to his father, Charles I. In a sense he was a better man morally than his brother Charles, but he also suffered far too much from energy, coupled with a catastrophic lack of political judgment. Parliament was generous to him indeed in its financial grants. In sum then, the king’s dispensing power was being exercised with a freedom that was clearly turning it into an illegal suspension of the law, the very thing which parliament had declared against in 1673. By September 1688 then, Louis of France considered himself free of that threat and obligation and he moved his troops south in order to invade the Palatinate in south Germany; the first steps in a renewed war. He was allowed to escape to France, and on the 24 of December 1688 an assembly of the nobility asked William and Mary to take up the reins of government."
631,history,hist-251,lecture-23,"Professor Wrightson discusses the remarkable growth of the British economy in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. He examines the changed context of stable population and prices; regional agricultural specialization; urbanization; the expansion of overseas trade both with traditional European trading partners and with the Americas and the East; the growth of manufacturing industries which served both domestic and overseas markets, and the intensification of internal trade. He describes and explains the emergence of an increasingly closely articulated national market economy, closely linked to a nascent world economy in which Britain now played a core role.","Well, the Glorious Revolution of 1688, so-called, which I described last time, began as a relatively bloodless coup, but it did go on to usher in some pretty massive changes in the structure of government and also in Britain’s standing in the world. But part of understanding that change requires us to understand how Britain was able to sustain that kind of role after 1688 and that brings us back to the economy, especially in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. The population stabilized, but it didn’t decline. All of that involved, and was part and parcel of, a general regional reorientation in land use. Increasingly, the east and the southeast of the country were predominantly arable. One of the most striking features of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries is that although population as a whole stabilized the population of the towns and the population of the rural industrial areas continued to grow both absolutely and relatively. In the 1960s, as a result of the work of Ralph Davis, who was the first economic historian to really map the trends in trade in this period, people began to talk of the late seventeenth century as a period of ‘commercial revolution’, which is a description which has some justice to it. Nine tenths of the pepper that came in from the East was re-exported. Certain goods could only be exported to the colonies in English ships. Half the merchant fleet was based in London. Prominent amongst these markets were of course the Americas and the growing colonies there. They’re still made in the west of England. And so one could go on for other less dramatic developments in regional industrial specialization and growth. But a great deal of the raw materials used were being produced at home. Wooden wagon ways, railways built of wood along which wagons would run to transport coal more cheaply and easily, wagons pulled by horses, were introduced from the 1660s and were commonplace in the coal mining areas by the early eighteenth century. It could encourage spin-off developments. One indicator of that, to close, is the proliferation of village shops in this period. Such local tradesmen as Abraham Dent showed how far England’s local economies had moved away from the era of relative self-sufficiency which I described at the beginning of this lecture course, and the existence of shops like Dent’s symbolize, in a sense, the completion of a massive process of commercial integration and transition. It was not yet what he describes as the “mineral-based energy economy” of the Industrial Revolution era. But if it was still an organic economy it was a very advanced organic economy, and already in many ways beginning to anticipate the transformations which would come in the later eighteenth century with the introduction of steam power and mechanization."
632,history,hist-251,lecture-24,"In this lecture, Professor Wrightson discusses the transformation of the English state in the twenty years following the Glorious Revolution of 1688. He examines the ambiguities of the Revolutionary Settlement which placed authority in William III and Mary II following the deposition/abdication of James II, and the manner in which parliamentary government was strengthened through responses to the demands of the wars precipitated by the revolution, culminating in the constitutional provisions of the Act of Settlement of 1701. Finally he considers the origins and outcomes of the 1707 Act of Union which fused the kingdoms of Scotland and England into the United Kingdom of Great Britain, and ends by briefly characterizing the paradoxical realities of the British state of 1714.","When I was at school we were often told that one of the great things about British history was that the country had never been successfully invaded by a foreign power since 1066 when William the Conqueror and the Normans conquered the Saxon kingdom, and this was part of the national story as we got it. Well, these are some of the key elements classically stressed from the eighteenth century onwards in Whig historiography. On the 22 of January 1689, a Convention Parliament met to begin working out the settlement. But he also withdrew himself and abdicated, so he hadn’t actually been deposed for his offenses. It was shaped partly by political and religious prejudices, and partly also by the constraining force of immediate circumstances. War first of all to defend the Revolutionary Settlement against Jacobite risings — Jacobites being supporters of James — Jacobite risings in Scotland in 1689 to ‘90, then to oust James II from Ireland where he’d landed with an army in 1689 to ‘91, culminating in the Battle of the Boyne at which James was defeated and fled back to France. Under Charles II, Parliament’s ultimate control of the public purse was of course not in doubt but, as you know, suspicion of the crown’s policies could mean that Parliament was unwilling to grant supply. There was also the development of a market in various forms of state securities, these new state securities which were being issued. In 1717, after the end of the War of the Spanish Succession, a variety of sinking funds were established to pay off parts of the debt, but it was generally recognized that a public debt of some size, reliably serviced in the way I’ve described, would be a permanent fact of life thereafter. But if Parliament was willing to provide the resources which made possible that kind of growth in the power of the state, Parliament also exacted a price. But if Whigs and Tories fought furiously for dominance in both Parliament and in local politics, there were also vital areas in which they were fundamentally at one, and that was revealed in 1701 when the death of Princess Anne’s only child, the ultimate heir to the throne, called into question the future succession of the crown. This raised, in the early years of the eighteenth century, a potentially dangerous situation. In 1707, after protracted negotiations a Treaty of Union was at last agreed. The Scots would join a single parliament for the United Kingdom meeting in Westminster. Many Scots at the time feared that it would be the former. The Union then, one could say, confirmed neither the fears nor initially the full hopes of the Scots who had agreed to it."
633,history,hist-251,lecture-25,"In this final lecture, Professor Wrightson reviews the major themes of the class through a reflection on the nature of the historical process. He explains how the developments traced in the course illustrate the complex and ambiguous nature of historical change and emphasizes the importance of studying history as a means of “understanding ourselves in time” through the disciplined recreation of the past in the present. He concludes by offering his thanks to the teaching fellows.",": Okay, well today we’re just winding down. And that’s not just true of England or Britain, but also of a larger world that at one time or another was subject to British influence, firsthand or at secondhand. To that extent, many of these things are a widely shared legacy and worth knowing something about. He meant reflecting on the actual nature of the historical process. We’re looking at societies which are in constant motion. And it’s because of the ambiguities in all of this that I’ve tried to adopt a variety of perspectives; looking at things from the Catholic point of view and from the Protestant point of view, from the monarchical, from the populist; history as viewed from the top, or from the bottom, or from the middle; history wearing breeches, history dressed in a gown. It contains, in the evidence it leaves to us, many voices, all of which deserve to be heard."
634,history,hist-251,lecture-2,"Professor Wrightson provides a broad sketch of the social order of early modern England, focusing on the hierarchical language of “estates” and “degrees” and the more communitarian ideal of the “commonwealth” by which society was organized. The differences between the social structure in rural and urban areas are addressed and the subordinate roles of women and the young are also outlined. Professor Wrightson discusses the differences between members of peerage, the gentry, and the commonalty and the social positions of servants, yeoman, husbandmen, and apprentices are explained. The mechanisms by which the social order was preserved, such as prescriptive literature and ecclesiastical injunctions, are also considered. Professor Wrightson concludes that, while in the theory the social order was rigidly hierarchical and rooted in relationships of authority and subordination, in practice there was a great more flexibility and ambiguity within every day interpersonal social relationships.","Well this week and next week I’m going to concentrate on setting the contexts, introducing you to the contours of an unfamiliar society, and today I’ll start with the social order, how people perceived their social world as a whole in the sixteenth century. Then he turned to the second estate, what he called the ‘chivalry’. In earth he hath assigned kings, princes with other governors under them, all in good and necessary order. And indeed the three degrees as Dudley described them can be shuffled together into a single rank order of precedence, as they were when people went on processions, for example. Beneath the crown came Dudley’s chivalry and that was itself internally differentiated into, on the one hand — and your handout will help with this — on the one hand, the peerage, and on the other hand the gentry. In the sixteenth century they were usually selected to be made knights from amongst the leading families of each of the forty counties of the kingdom, and the title could not be inherited. Millers and blacksmiths were able to make a good living, for example. Some of them might have a trade from time to time, but most of them relied upon wages for at least a significant part of their income, working as farm laborers on the holdings of bigger tenants. What you can say in general is that rural society was highly differentiated. Complete dependence upon wage labor was still exceptional in the countryside and I emphasize that because that’s something that was going to change, as we’ll see, in the course of the sixteenth century. At the top the great merchants of the cities could be men of prodigious wealth who were generally also the rulers of their towns. You put out work to skilled workers and you collect the goods and market them, and I mention it specifically because it was the form of organization in England’s most important single industry, the cloth industry, the manufacture of woolen cloth most of which was exported to Europe and which was very prominent in certain regions. Nevertheless, contemporary moralists did have very clear views about the place of women and children and the young in general, and in both cases that place was a subordinate one. She could hold no goods independently in marriage unless a separate trust had been erected for her. Servants were generally young, generally aged between about fourteen and the mid-twenties. Usually, apprentices were migrants to the towns. Far fewer people lived through to their fifties and even fewer to their sixties when they enjoyed these positions of authority. It was conceived of as a commonwealth, as an organic whole, but one constituted of people whose opportunities and experiences were very far from uniform or equal, and that structured inequality was taken to be part of the natural order of society."
635,history,hist-251,lecture-3,"Professor Wrightson lectures on the structures of households in early modern England. Differentiating between urban and rural households, the households of great lords and those of yeoman, husbandmen, and craftsmen, the varying structures and compositions of households are discussed. The process by which households were established, courtship and marriage, are addressed. Stressing the various ways in which early modern households differed from modern notions of the home, Professor Wrightson analyzes the roles played by individuals within them. The positions occupied by women and the array of tasks that they were expected to perform in furtherance of the household economy receive detailed attention, as do the experiences of children. Professor Wrightson discusses the manner in which households could be affected by external crises, such as plague or harvest failure, and touches on the strategies and steps employed by householders to ensure survival of this important unit.","Well, last time I was looking at the vital social distinctions that were recognized in the sixteenth century and also how people conceived of society as a whole. So all households have that much in common but they vary greatly in their size, their composition, and the complexity of the relationships contained within them. Whereas we tend to think of a household as a unit of residence and consumption, child rearing, and provision of emotional support — all of that was true in the sixteenth century too — but the household in the sixteenth century also had more extensive functions which we don’t associate with the household today. When people died inventories of their goods were drawn up and from them we can learn every single possession that they had, and it’s striking how sparse domestic interiors were in this period. So huswifery as they understood it in the sixteenth century was concerned not so much with managing a domestic environment as with managing the daily consumption needs of the household. Well, lots of records that survive from the many courts which governed many aspects of local life give us little glimpses of what people are doing. One glimpse survives of a woman called Rose, Rose Hearst. In most areas there was a minority of those large yeoman farmers I mentioned last time. But in such circumstances the small farmer might not be able to feed his own family; he might fall behind on his rent; he might have to buy grain in the market at inflated prices. Other sources of insecurity could be equally unpredictable. So this was another hazard of life which would periodically strike, devastating the households that were infected. It was a period which had no pensions for those who were left behind. Some of them are described as husbandmen. They’re farm workers living in the household with these yeoman farmers and most of them, as you’ll see, are pretty young; they’re in their late teens or early twenties. These were families in which marriage might have great social and political significance and it was too important to leave to the young people themselves. It’s not a unilateral matter for the young people alone. In 1500, for example, one study shows that the portions which were given to daughters of the gentry in the county of Kent, which is down here in the southeast, averaged around 280 pounds. And nor was it a matter for the fathers alone because if they laid down in their wills the division of their goods amongst their children it’s also very clear that the successful completion of these family strategies usually depended upon the sustaining of the household economy after the father’s death by their widows. It lay of course with the household head. Accordingly, you find in the evidence that wives were very often far from being the silent spectators of the decisions that were made regarding their family’s well-being."
636,history,hist-251,lecture-4,"Professor Wrightson begins by discussing how modern perceptions of the “traditional” community have informed the manner in which the early modern social landscape is discussed. From here he moves on to address the lived reality of community and social bonds in the period. The roles that the intertwined ideas of lordship and tenancy, custom, neighborliness and social “credit” played in rural manors and parishes are examined, as are urban institutions like the guilds, and relationships of kinship more generally. Professor Wrightson argues that the social bonds of community and neighborliness were indeed key features of early modern society and could occupy a pivotal position in people’s lives, but also warns that communities could also be restrictive and riven by conflicts and tensions. While recognizing the importance of bonds of mutual obligation, we must not sentimentalize them.","Well, last time looking at the household provided a point of entry to some of the basic realities and priorities that shape people’s lives at the most basic level in the sixteenth century. It’s a perennial aspect of the human situation, but if you want to consider it in the past then we can best do so by trying to carefully reconstruct the actual ties, institutional and personal, that linked people together, the ties through which they mapped out their social world, so to speak; the ties through which they made it legible and understandable. We’ve already encountered these in a social order imagined in terms of hierarchical ties of obligation and differentiation. That was a customary form by which you would take land for the life of yourself, your wife, and your eldest child. So lordship and the relationship between lords and tenants was a defining relationship in any rural community. It created a local map of rights and of obligations. Nevertheless, it carried this aura of antiquity. To this extent custom was seen as being essentially the property of the tenant community. If custom was one key word in rural society, “neighborliness” was emphatically another. Well, that kind of arrangement, that kind of scattering of land around the field, that sharing of common grazing land inevitably meant that there had to be a good deal of cooperative organization of agriculture in such a place, and the manor court provided the opportunities to pass bylaws which enabled people to draw up the rules for their cooperative agriculture. There was a very strong expectation that ultimately people would conform to a system which was ruled by custom in the interests of ensuring the sustainability of the agriculture of the community as a whole and the subsistence of its component households. So ties of neighborhood were something which one could also extend from the countryside in to urban communities. In the town of Folkestone, which is down here on the south coast in Kent, for example, one young woman who had been recently married and was coming to the town with her husband for the first time found that in the street where they were going to live the neighbors were gathered. Members of the guild were under obligation to relieve other members of the guild who fell sick. They provided for widows and orphans from charitable funds that they maintained. When Queen Elizabeth I made her first entry into the city of London in 1559, for example, the streets were lined by the city guilds all in their liveries to greet the new queen. People moved around a good deal more than used to be thought. That’s what I’ve been talking about obviously. I’ll leave it there, and next time I’ll go on to look at urban society more fully and the network of connections which bound together the kingdom as a whole.—1."
637,history,hist-251,lecture-5,"Professor Wrightson discusses local particularism and regionalism in early modern England and highlights the importance of local customs and economic patterns. He then focuses on the manner in which these local areas, while enjoying a measure of cultural, institutional, and economic autonomy, were simultaneously integrated into a larger national whole. The role of trade (both between English regions and with the Continent via the Netherlands), the importance of market towns within the localities as nexuses of social and economic interaction, the place of ‘provincial capitals,’ and the pivotal position of the metropolis of London are all considered. Throughout the lecture Professor Wrightson also provides details of early modern regional topography and information concerning the role of urban areas in early modern social and economic life.","Well, today is the fourth and final of the contextual lectures introducing sixteenth-century England. And that kind of organization in the putting-out system of the cloth industry was very widespread indeed. Parts of Kent, lots of places in the West Country, and a number of places scattered across the north were heavily involved in manufacturing England’s most famous product at this time, high-quality woolen cloth. So, for example, to indicate what I’m trying to express here, the fact that the coal industry was centered on Tyneside (up here in the northeast of the country) was not simply because coal was found there and was found near to the surface where it could be reached with relatively simple technology. Local market areas were based upon small market towns. The country depended upon the towns to provide a place to trade and also for specialist manufactures, specialist services of various kinds. There were thirty-two settlements in the area. Four of them had between eighteen and twenty-seven occupations. The north is a very good example and Richmond is a splendid place to visit. As you know, village populations were not rooted and immobile. The wool which was produced in East Anglia or Lincolnshire or the north would find its way down to the woolen industry in the west and the southeast. Watermen rowed people hither and thither and  is a good example of that kind of thing if you’ve seen that movie. The Archbishop of York was based there in York Minster, the wonderful cathedral. In Bristol a similar study shows that the apprentices came from all over the west Midlands and they came from — let me just check the figure — thirty-seven different towns and villages of which twenty-five were actually located on the River Severn which runs up like that. They focused entire regions and bound them together into the national unit and they channeled inter-regional trade, but the final element of the kind of articulation that I’m talking about, of course, is at the ultimate national level and that’s provided above all by the capital city, London. An almost ridiculous example: if you were a great nobleman or a gentleman and you wanted to have a grand renaissance tomb erected in your parish church in preparation for your death. That’s where the stone masons were who would do something like that. The dominance of London was based upon the fact that it was so close to the crossing across to the Netherlands. In fact, woolen cloth alone made up two thirds of English exports in the early sixteenth century. They were the people who had truly national social networks with their equals as members of the elite. Other areas were less closely interconnected."
638,history,hist-251,lecture-6,"Professor Wrightson begins by discussing recent trends in English political history, which has expanded from focusing solely on institutions to include analysis of political culture. After this, the formal institutions of government, such as the various law courts, the offices of royal administration, and Parliament, are briefly defined and situated. In the remainder of the lecture, Professor Wrightson explores the dynamics of royal power and authority. The impact of the personalities of Henry VII and Henry VIII on their individual reigns are noted and their relationships with the nobility are focused upon. Professor Wrightson addresses the manner in which the early Tudor kings solidified and extended royal authority through the uses of propaganda, patronage, consultations, and coercion. He ends by signaling the expansion of government which was to occur post-1530 as a result of the issues of the succession and religious change.","Well, today we turn to politics and the structures of power under the early Tudors. Nevertheless, weak though his claim was, Henry was the last of the claimants of the Lancastrian House and he took the throne on the behalf of that particular group in English politics, which I’ll explain later. And to a considerable degree, as we’ll see, they all overlapped and reinforced one another, but taken together they comprised the polity of the time as contemporaries described it; the polity, a system of established government and rule. That was for a long time the really central concern of historians of this period. But high as the king’s dignity was, England was also, as one contemporary jurist, John Fortescue, put it, a   — he phrase is there on your handout — which meant that royal authority was supreme — that’s the  part — but it was also sustained and restrained by certain political expectations, certain constitutional institutions. They ruled with the advice of a variety of councils. Henry VII called such councils of his leading noblemen on a number of occasions. For the most part, for example, Henry VII’s day-to-day council consisted in its principal members not of the great nobles of the kingdom, but of great members of the church, notably Cardinal John Morton, who was one of his closest advisers in the early stages of his rule, and in addition a number of lawyers and professional administrators, those who are sometimes described as ‘men of business’, the nucleus of a kind of royal bureaucracy. So the king was expected to take counsel. In each county some leading gentlemen were appointed as justices of the peace commissioned to deal with crimes, usually petty crimes, and other administrative matters arising. The House of Lords consisted of the leading lay and church nobility of the realm summoned by a personal writ to attend. In others the choice of a member for Parliament was restricted to a small oligarchy of the leading citizens. They gave stability and continuity, but the actual exercise of power and the maintenance of the authority of government depended very much upon the personality of the king and the way in which the kings interacted with various important groups of people, communities of interest within the realm. He should have been mustering his troops to stop them. Darcy didn’t act because he was out of sympathy with royal policy in religion. His system of government has been described as being somewhat like the mob in the way that each of the great nobles had his quasi-independent sphere of influence. Maintaining authority over them was absolutely vital. There were royal entries to the cities accompanied by great ritual, pageants, display, and everywhere the royal badge was displayed. Access to the king was vital, and those who could control access to the king were in positions of real power. It handled all kinds of business brought to its attention. And these members in their turn got what they wanted. These were used, for example, against any nobleman who in any way infringed the requirements of new laws. But finally, changing government in the sixteenth century involved more than just reasserting royal authority."
639,history,hist-251,lecture-7,"In this lecture Professor Wrightson surveys the religious landscape of England during the later medieval period through to the reign of Henry VIII and the beginnings of the reformation. He notes that while the late medieval church was more vibrant and popular than many early triumphal analysis of the reformation allowed for, there were, nonetheless, critics of Catholicism within England. He traces the earlier opposition to the church as arising from three primary groups: those educated clerics and laymen who desired reform within the church, the small pockets of Lollards within England who opposed traditional religion, and the group of people influenced by European reformation thought who would later work to implement doctrinal change within the Church of England. Professor Wrightson also provides an analysis of late medieval piety and the role that the traditional church played in people’s daily lives at the local level prior to the reformation.","Well, last time we looked at the early Tudors reestablishing the authority of the monarchy, and now we turn towards what was to prove one of the biggest problems for most of the sixteenth century: the question of the authority of the church and of the nature of English religion. Ely Cathedral dates back to the twelfth century and when you go there the main nave of the cathedral is of magnificent Norman architecture, but rather gloomy. Attempts have been made to estimate their numbers. In a society in which the vast majority of people were illiterate, the decorations of the church — the paintings on the wall like those in Easby, the images, the carved images around the walls or the altars, the stained-glass windows with their pictures — all of these were to a large extent the books of the unlearned. It was the product of the medieval church’s toleration of what people refer to as syncretism, the blending together of different religious traditions, the Christianizing of some older traditions like those holy wells and sacred trees and so forth. And at times it could undoubtedly be hard to draw the line between where Christian devotion to the saints ended and superstitious practices began. Most of them from the early sixteenth century leave some bequest to religion. It supports such views as that of the historian Richard Rex who argues that “it’s possible that the ideal of a Christian community united in belief and worship,” an ideal which was to be pursued so zealously by Protestants and Catholics alike, “was never so closely approximated” to as in the late medieval parish. As for the higher clergy, by the early sixteenth century men like Thomas Wolsey were really spectacularly exceptional. John Colet, whose name is on your handout, the Dean of Saint Paul’s Cathedral in London, was a man who was deeply troubled by the failings of the church. He — in a famous sermon which he preached to Convocation, which was the gathering of the leading clergy, the parliament of the church if you like — in a sermon to Convocation in 1511 he castigated the pride and the worldliness which was to be found among some clergy. Bishop John Fisher of Rochester, which is down in Kent, or Bishop Tunstall, first of London, then of Durham, were other bishops who had reforming agendas of this kind within the church. Many of them saw both the pope and the church hierarchy as being a kind of collective representation of Antichrist. They regarded it as fraudulent and idolatrous. The Cambridge men, who included Thomas Cranmer, later to be the Archbishop of Canterbury under the reformed church, met secretly at a tavern known as the White Horse Tavern which was in the red light district of the town near the river — it still stands; it’s now the Cambridgeshire Folk Museum — and the meetings amongst them were known as Little Germany because they were discussing books which had been smuggled from the centers of the early reformation in Germany. They also discussed the works of the early Swiss reformers which were available to them. Well, the position of these early Protestants was often rather ambiguous. He saw it as a cluttered form of devotion. Tunstall, like many churchmen, associated the scriptures in English with Lollardy. In all probability, it would never have spontaneously gained the strength to mount a victorious challenge to the religious status quo of the kind that was mounted by Protestants in some of the cities of Germany and Switzerland and Flanders and so forth. And what made it possible was a contingent circumstance, a contingent circumstance of the kind that so often makes history take turns which are otherwise utterly unpredictable."
640,history,hist-251,lecture-8,"Professor Wrightson examines the various stages of the reformation in England, beginning with the legislative, as opposed to doctrinal, reformation begun by Henry VIII in a quest to settle the Tudor succession. Wrightson shows how the jurisdictional transformation of the royal supremacy over the church resulted, gradually, in the introduction of true religious change. The role played by various personalities at Henry’s court, and the manner in which the King’s own preferences shaped the doctrines of the Church of England, are considered. Doctrinal change, in line with continental Protestant developments, accelerated under Edward VI, but was reversed by Mary I. However, Wrightson suggests that, by this time, many aspects of Protestantism had been internalized by part of the English population, especially the young, and so the reformation could not wholly be undone by Mary’s short reign. The lecture ends with the accession of Elizabeth I in 1558, an event which presaged further religious change.","Well, we’d better get started because there’s quite a lot of ground to cover today as you will see from the handouts. Well, if there was a phase of blundering about, as Christopher Haigh puts it, then it came at the beginning, and it was occasioned of course by the fact that the King and his advisers were facing a completely unprecedented situation in 1527. First of all, Katherine was a very strong personality. In September 1529, Cardinal Wolsey, who had clearly failed Henry, was threatened with the legal charge of , which was an offense established by statutes in the fourteenth century regarding the jurisdiction of church and state within England. The second crucial argument, which they put forward, was that within England the king enjoyed imperial power, not only over the state but over the church in matters which were not of a strictly spiritual nature. The convocation of the church, meeting in Canterbury, resisted and Henry demanded that they recognize his supreme headship of the church. By December 1532 she was known to be pregnant and in January of 1533 they were secretly married. The King was willing to go ahead and do that because he was convinced that his first marriage would be declared to have been void. They had rejected the jurisdictional authority of Rome, they had asserted the royal supremacy over the church, and in 1534 to ‘5 this was backed up with a flurry of executions of individuals who dared to defend the Aragon marriage and the authority of the pope, and those who were executed included John Fisher, the reforming Bishop of Rochester who could not tolerate this, and most famously Thomas More, the former Lord Chancellor, former good servant of the King, who also could not stomach this and died for it. Now on the face of it, the royal supremacy over the church had nothing whatever to do with religious reformation. And they did a great deal to mold developments. It was not presented as an attack on monasticism in principle but as an attack upon abuses. There was not much doubt that by 1539 things had gone a lot farther than anyone anticipated and that elements of reformed doctrine were being gradually smuggled into Henry’s church. And the new king, King Edward, was only nine and a half years old and that of course is another of those contingencies that helped to shape the history of the reformation. The Duke of Northumberland lost his nerve. But a deeply loyal Catholic she certainly was. The universities of Oxford and Cambridge were also purged. If she had no reason to love her father’s memory, it’s clear at least that she shared his implacability with those who opposed her, and by doing so the persecution helped to cement England’s religious divisions and associated the old religion with a level of persecution that was wholly unprecedented. Christopher Haigh suggests, as have a number of other recent historians, that her reign appears to be an aberration only in hindsight. She was childless despite a couple of phantom pregnancies which gave her hope."
641,history,hist-251,lecture-9,"Professor Wrightson surveys the changing economic landscape of early modern England in the early sixteenth century. He notes that, throughout the period, population levels rose and, at the same time, inflation caused a rise in prices, and real wages fell. While many landowners were able to raise rents on their lands and profit from enclosing land, and many yeoman farmers prospered, these trends also resulted in a measure of social dislocation and a growth in poverty and vagrancy. Moral outrage at these developments was voiced by the so-called Commonwealth’s Men, and popular discontent resulted in large scale rebellions, such as the Pilgrimage of Grace and Kett’s Rebellion. Professor Wrightson ends by discussing the economic thought of Sir Thomas Smith, which influenced government initiatives to combat these problems.","Well, we’ve seen now how the early Tudors managed to reestablish the authority of the monarchy; how that achievement was threatened by the succession crisis which was looming under Henry VIII; how that problem was met by actions which further extended royal authority over the church, but at the same time, of course, introduced a new form of instability into the kingdom — potential conflict over religion. That’s very bad news when prices are rising. This was done by landlords who were short of tenants. Why would the crown dispose of the land in this kind of way? Another significant group were upwardly mobile people from the middle ranks of society: yeoman farmers piecing together field to field until they could emerge with a sufficient estate to call themselves gentlemen; people from the towns who had no gentry ancestry, perhaps lawyers, perhaps merchants, prosperous craftsmen and tradesmen, who were able to acquire land and its superior social status, perhaps in some cases on a level which would again bring them into the lower ranks of the gentry. A lot of the monastic land was bought by speculators who rapidly sold it on. Then there were those who were — one could think of as would-be farm tenants, those who might aspire to getting a foothold on the land but found it increasingly difficult because rents were rising, fines were rising and so forth, and they couldn’t compete with the bigger guys in the village who could take up land that came available on the local market. It could be quite a difficult time for the young in that respect. It was more a matter of the poverty that resulted from life cycle crises of a small minority of people: the widowed, the aged, the sick, orphaned children. But as the sixteenth century advanced people began talking and writing about poverty in two worryingly expanded forms. For some people this brought new opportunities and indeed enhanced prosperity. Contemporaries didn’t have information of this kind. Well, these ideas not only persisted throughout the early sixteenth century but they were powerfully reemphasized in the 1540s with the emergence of a group of moralists, most of them Protestant clergymen, in the reign of Edward VI, who addressed these social and economic grievances. They thought this was the opportunity to achieve it, and yet they saw all around them evidence of the corruption of social relationships by what they saw as the cardinal sin of covetousness, one of their favorite words, covetousness — greed — and the pernicious idea again which they constantly refer to that, quote, “every man may do with his own as he will.” They denounced the representatives of covetousness whom they identified. It had discovered it for the first time in English, and as I say, the language of Jeremiah or Isaiah is the kind of language that they used to denounce what they saw as a world out of joint. From about the 1530s onwards, researchers working on records of local government and on the courts find that the country was increasingly pockmarked with minor forms of disorder as the peasantry of particular localities resisted initiatives on the part of their landlords, perhaps rioting against the enclosing of fields or of common land and so forth, or against changes in their customs and tenures. And when the crown got the opportunity with the flurry of a few more agrarian troubles in the northwest at the beginning of the following year royal troops went in and suppressed them with considerable violence. They were trying to preserve the rights that they had in the land in a changing economic climate which threatened to diminish them, trying to create a world in which gentlemen were kept at arm’s length, and their statements of grievances and demands make very interesting reading."
642,history,hist-276,lecture-10,"Because drinking is such an integral part of French culture, alcohol abuse has been historically ignored. Although there have been celebrated attempts to address this problem, such as Zola , it is only in the past five or ten years that the government has seriously tried to tackle the problem of alcoholism. One of the major ways in which alcohol is embedded in the cultural identity of the country is the close association of certain wines and liquors with their regions of production. Likewise, different types of bars serve as loci for social interaction, and have always played a central role in rural as well as urban life.","So, the subject is drink and in particular drinking too much. Impressionist painting, for example, the role of  where you could go and be entertained as you drank, is important in Impressionism; or paintings of the coast, of the Normand coast by Morisseau and lots of other people. So, more and more people are dependent upon wine for getting by. And somebody told me recently that California wine is now facing phylloxera. But what’s incredible is that the number of cafés continues to expand exponentially. And you compare that to Elboeuf, which is a town in Normandy, one for every sixty. And you see the difference between American construction industry and French construction industry. Again, then here we go back to myth, but the myth is that it came back with soldiers of Napoleon’s armies returning from the German states, just as the myth that the consumption of vodka, which is very — now there’s a big problem because they sell, these companies sell this pernicious vodka stuff mixed with fruit juice, and the  students get wasted with it. And then it became legal again, and now you can produce it, and you can drink it, and it’s more of a southern drink. He was interested in the way that crowds behaved, and he described them in ways that reflected three of the kind of cultural/intellectual preoccupations of the period, of the Third Republic before World War I. First, he describes crowds as flighty, that they’ll go from one place to another — think of the women in the castration scene in Decazville — and that was reflective of the fact that women were supposed to be flighty and not rational, and what does that fear reflect? But this was, this image of this street, was something that fascinated upper class readers. And, of course, now in more refined times is that true or not? And another drink came along too, that’s identified with the region, that some of you may know about, and I hope if you’re under 21 you’ve never drunk, and that is called a kir, k-i-r. You look at the k, and you think, “well, that’s an Alsatian or Breton name,” because there aren’t words in French that begin with k. But actually Kir was, he was the mayor of Dijon, I guess, in about the 1940s and ’50s, and he came up with the idea of putting — somebody else had had the idea but he drank a lot of these things — of putting this sort of black currant into white wine. Again, even ten years ago they started this campaign against drinking too much. I must say now the last five or six years they really have made it harder because they have not gone the Swedish way, but they have — it used to be you could have an aperitif, you could have three glasses of — a big, a  is a big glass of wine, and maybe a little  afterward, and the guy said, “blow into this” — what do you call those, those , and he says, “well see you , .” And he brought his friend from work, ironically in a halfway house for alcoholics, and this guy made my friend look like a skatback, look like this tiny little guy, and this guy’s at least about, I’m serious, about 350 pounds. But, they’ve done a very good thing in trying to control drink. And that’s what came to this sort of elaboration of meals and occasions for sociability, that’s where it becomes part of the culture."
643,history,hist-276,lecture-11,"Modern Paris was indelibly shaped by the rebuilding project ordered by Napoleon III and carried out by Baron Haussmann in the 1850s and ’60s. The large-scale demolition of whole neighborhoods in central Paris, coupled with a boom in industrial development outside the city, cemented a class division between center and periphery that has persisted into the twenty-first century. Curiously, this division is the obverse of the arrangement of most American cities, in which the inner city is typically impoverished while the suburbs are wealthy.","Okay, today we’re going to talk about Paris. But another reason why there are not a lot of people about or any signs of life is that this has already been targeted for demolition, and the people have had to move out of what was already a poor neighborhood to find an even poorer one on the margins of urban life. That was a photograph by Charles Melville. So, now, if you’re looking later, in 1855 you see that the city had expanded but you still have the wall around Paris and you still have these sort of rural areas within the city. You know about the barricades, at least some of you do anyway, of the French Revolution. There are more barricades in 1830, there are more barricades in 1851. And, so, this is again a photo from 1900. So, this is basically — there are a few automobiles racing around; they’re not racing, the speed limit was three miles an hour; but now, of course, you’re a dead duck if you try to cross there. So, that just gives you kind of a view from the top. And, so, Louis Napoleon has other expositions. But it’s the ’50s and ’60s that brings to London, and to Vienna, and to Berlin, and to Paris the department store, where you could buy forty different kinds of shawls, cheap shawls to very fancy shawls. This is where the police were, at the Châtelet in the eighteenth century. And you can over-emphasize his themes too much but it’s still worth keeping in mind. You had to pay a tax on what you brought into the city, more about that in a minute. But you can see that these boulevards become extensions of these walls that had once been there. Because this is something of the , and the first metro opened along the Seine, paralleling the Seine, on July 14th, 1900, for the exhibition; it’s now the line that goes to Île-de-France all the way out to Vincennes, to the east. You can imagine this is someplace where someone lived, and ran up and down the stairs, and had fun, and then went out and got away from the sort of industry of Argenteuil. And this wall, or this taxing apparatus, is called in French the, o-c-t-r-o-i. And I love these little buildings. And on the edge of Paris are created these working-class industrial suburbs that are feared by the center, and during the 1920s and 1930s become major sources of support for the Communist Party, because people, most of the people who lived there were extremely badly lodged, and the Communists do very well because of the , that is people who are badly lodged, and they provide services to poor working families that in other municipalities simply one did not have. And even the image when you say, in French you say, you come from the , you come from ninety-three, that means Seine-Saint-Denis, and that — for them that’s the image of the ninety-three license plate is that of the periphery, of people who are thought to be marginal by the center."
644,history,hist-276,lecture-12,"France’s colonial properties were thought of in the latter half of the nineteenth century as consolation for the bitter loss of Alsace and Lorraine to Germany. As civilian administrators came to replace military personnel in the colonies, and as more and more French settlers arrived, empire and colonialism came to play an important function in France’s cultural self-presentation. World War I heralded the eventual decline of the French empire, a decline realized at the hands of the colonized subjects themselves.","Today we have my friend, Charles Keith, who’s finishing his doctoral dissertation on Catholic Vietnam in the 1920s and ’30s, and he is going to be talking about French Imperialism from the origins of the Third Republic up until the war in 1914. Diplomacy used to be concerned with the Mediterranean and the Bosphorus; now it has to do with China and the Congo. Although many of these were lost during the era of the French Revolution, one of the Revolution’s most powerful legacies was the idea of a moral imperative to continue the revolution beyond France’s borders; in other words, France had not only a right but a duty to bring French civilization to the rest of the world. Even the bulk of French expansion in Algeria after 1830 (Algeria was really France’s major colony in the years — for most of the nineteenth century) even this was largely the work of generals who waved the flag and shot their rifles, often in direct opposition to the wishes of national governments in Paris. Yes, this happens places other than France, heads getting cut off. So, in many ways it was this colonial lobby that was most responsible for imagining and spreading the idea that national greatness was closely tied to colonial expansion. Colonies slowly but surely crept into the most mundane forms of everyday life. Even the goods that people bought increasingly evoked the colonies, often through advertising. Settlers were often committed to the colonies for life. When there weren’t enough Frenchmen, landowners didn’t hesitate to populate their lands with non-French Europeans like Italian and Spanish, some of whom were also in the colonies as members of the famous international military force, the Légion Étrangère, the Foreign Legion. Places that had once been considered too dangerous for women became places where women eager to marry went to find a husband. Most settlers, for example, had to build and maintain their own houses, clear forests or brush, and set up their own shops. For the most part, life was really quite separate between whites and others. Of course, not all was well in the empire. Needless to say, the realities of empire did not often coincide with Jules Ferry’s promises to spread the best of French civilization, nor did it coincide with the caricature of the smiling, graceful African in the popular press or on the front of the Banania box on the breakfast table. French structures of authority enforced inequality between French and other races, and justified the exploitation of resources and the political repression that really were the realities of everyday life, for most of the French colonial subjects. Like their counterparts in the colonial lobby, anti-colonialists opposed French expansion for a number of reasons. When the French colonial empire eventually expired in 1962, when the French left Algeria, it did so first and foremost because of the many forms of resistance organized and carried out by those who lived under its yoke. For some people it did seem for a time that what the French were saying about the , the civilizing mission, might actually in fact be true. Europe’s prestige had been greatly compromised. What had been a point of unification in France slowly turned into a source for political and cultural tension."
645,history,hist-276,lecture-13,"The traditional, diplomatic history of World War I is helpful in understanding how a series of hitherto improbable alliances come to be formed in the early years of the twentieth century. In the case of France and Russia, this involves a significant ideological compromise. Along with the history of imperial machinations, however, World War I should be understood in the context of the popular imagination and the growth of nationalist sentiment in Europe.","Wasn’t that good the other day, Charles Keith, you liked that lecture? So, what to focus on is just — when you’re looking at this thing, is there’s Africa. And, so, that’s a major issue in Western Europe — is obviously the relationship between these folks and Alsace, and the parts of Lorraine that had been annexed into the German Empire; annexed rather uncomfortably, as we’ll see in awhile. But most people thought there would be a war in their lifetime, because of these antagonisms. More than that, many people, how many it’s difficult to say, wanted a war — more about that later. Now, the last thing that Bismarck wants — and remember Bismarck’s out of there; you may not know this, but he’s out of there in about 1894, isn’t that — ? And what this does is it ends what Bismarck had intended, the diplomatic isolation of France, and now these guys are surrounded. So, the last thing they do, that the British think that they can do is lose control of the seas, and all these big German ships in kind of an aggressive way, that they’re inaugurated by this — Nicholas or by the Kaiser, Wilhelm II banging bottles of German champagne over these ships, and giving more heated speeches about Germany’s destiny and place in the world, et cetera, et cetera. So, the way to do it, and not for the last time, they are willing to violate Belgian neutrality, and Dutch neutrality, though that disappears from the plan. That guarantees that without any question at all, guarantees that the British will go to war. And this is 1913.Now, Alsace and parts of Lorraine are annexed in 1871. But again, showing the sort of people can have multiple identities. And, so, for the point of view of the German military, in particular, they don’t trust the Alsatians, even though they speak German, they speak the same German that is spoken across the Rhine River in Freiberg, for example. It’s built into the planning, and we will see how that happens. But they gave me the book of the documents showing that the Germans started it all. And Charles alluded very effectively, very cleverly, to some of the other factors the other day, and I barely need to repeat them, but that the imperial rivalry helps create this culture of popular imperialism which feeds into this culture of popular aggressive nationalism that — in which the Other, whether it be an indigenous person who dares stand up for his or her rights in Mali, or somewhere like that; the next stage is identifying the Other, the dangerous Other, as being one’s enemy, traditional enemy in some — in the case of Germany and France, on the continent."
646,history,hist-276,lecture-14,"The sacred union that united France’s political parties during World War I contributed to a resilient morale on the home front. Germany’s invasion of France, and the conflict over Alsace-Lorraine in particular, contributed to French concern over atrocities and the national investment in the war effort. New weapons and other fighting technologies, coupled with the widespread use of trenches, made fighting tremendously difficult and gruesome on all fronts.","Okay, I want to talk about the war up through 1916 today, and then followed by 1917 and 1918 on Wednesday. The big fortress of Liège — when I get so close here I can’t see — but Liège there falls, and falls to the young — not so young, but — commander, Ludendorff, after a huge bombardment on the 16th, followed by the fall of Namur. The second factor, which is often forgotten, is that the Sacred Union, this , is extremely effective in mobilizing through propaganda but also through extremely intelligent action, bringing help, for example, to people trying to bring the harvest in, using troops, and when they have them fairly soon, capture German soldiers to help bring the harvest in, and they also begin to give , or sort of family allocations, family resources I guess is a way of putting that, to families who the departure of sons, brothers, and fathers was catastrophic; but, of course, they hadn’t seen anything yet. But they’re very shrewd in this, and the home front, unlike Berlin — and that’s another story — but the home front in France holds throughout the entire war. And what you have basically is you have a race to the sea. And, so, basically, as you can see from this map, that the trenches go all the way from Switzerland, literally, to the English Channel, and that is where  of France and these other countries, where the youth, the young men, and some older men, too, of these countries, died. That was the end, where their short lives ended, in the vast majority of the cases. That’s where the Germans first used poison gas. Or the Somme is the obvious example that everybody uses and I will use again in awhile. And reports put in the civilian press about the hardy, vigorous life of these soldiers, because they’re in such good shape, because they’re eating well — which was obviously not the case, they’re eating frozen potatoes, and when Pétain increases the rum ration so they could go over the top a little tipsy to get killed in Verdun in 1916.So, there was this enormous — and this is one of the scenes in the literature of the war — there’s this huge discontinuity between the civilian life and the soldiers. They know they’re not going to break through, but again it has ultimately to do with that French birthrate, is that they know, because they have more children, they can afford to lose more German soldiers; that is, if you were German, you guys, then the French, that is you guys, or the British, you guys, if you were French or you were British. And here you have — these are the entrance. You can go, as a tourist you can go right into there. These are not where these plaques are all put up around here, like they’re inside a church. But generally they used these kind of periscopes to look up and to survey the scene. Go there sometime, go into Vaux and Douaumont and try to imagine what it’s like. You can see that too, they removed the bones."
647,history,hist-276,lecture-15,"1917 is a critical moment in World War I, as the Bolsheviks seize power in Russia and Woodrow Wilson leads the U.S. into war on the side of the Allied powers. Although morale held steady on the home front in France, there were multiple mutinies and strikes as the war progressed. These mutinies were not in favor of German victory; rather, they were in protest of corruption at home, in the form of incompetence and profiteering. Literary and historical records of World War I bear witness to the difficulty faced by soldiers in reentering civilian life after returning home.","Maybe one or two of you have heard this before. I must have done this too when I showed up late for midterms or whatever, if I remembered to go, you just — you panic and you start writing. I got taken out there a little bit here, thinking about those old times. But the other thing that changes the outcome of the war is that the Americans come in. ”And, so, that’s the big Ludendorff offensive, which I’ll come back to, in March of 1918. And the mutinies are not on the home front but they’re quite close to it. As I said at the beginning here, most people in France did not want war in 1914, but because it was easy to portray Germany as the aggressors, which they were, the vast majority of the population obviously was prepared to hold on because of the proximity certainly of Paris to the front; and this is right through the war, it’s right through into the failure of the Ludendorff offensive. And there’s another tension too that’s not talked about so much, but I can — I’ve heard it in the sort of collective memory of where we live too, is that one of the things that happens with the war — and obviously when you look at a map of France — that  like the Ardennes, and the Ain, and the Marne, and the Pas-de-Calais, and the Nord are basically German, or the front line is running right through that . So, you’ve got these millions of people who become refugees and they are going — in a more organized fashion than in 1940 when everybody’s seen the pictures of them walking along the roads, carrying what they can, and then diving into the ditches as the Luftwaffe, the German fighter plane, the German air force is strafing them, in a more organized fashion. Well, they end up in the places in France where there is not fighting. And, so, they are strains on local resources, which are already extremely limited. And, so, 1917 is a big year for that as well. A very good book edited by my friend Jay Winter and Jean-Louis Robert called  — because conditions are worse in Berlin than they are in Paris. Most of the generals, who are fairly clueless, see organized Bolshevik propaganda behind this; or pacifists, those people coming out of Sweden or Switzerland and trying to stop the useless way this war is being fought. And the Americans have, by spring of 1918, 325,000 soldiers. Church of Saint-Gervais, right near the Seine. Just in terms of dead and wounded, just a couple — you can write these down, you can write them down or don’t write them down. There is, by the way, but one soldier left in Great Britain who’s still alive from World War One. And periodically, on Armistice Day, he is interviewed; you can hear him on BBC. Abel Gance, g-a-n-c-e, did a very long, over-rated film on Napoleon, with the famous snowball fight."
648,history,hist-276,lecture-16,"The human cost of World War I cannot be understood only in terms of demographics. To better understand the consequences of the war upon both soldiers and civilians it is necessary to consider mourning in its private, as well as its public dimensions. Indeed, for many French people who lived through the war, public spectacles of bereavement, such as the Unknown Soldier, were also conceived of as intensely private affairs. Both types of mourning are associated with a wide variety of rituals and procedures.","It’s a great pleasure to have my wonderful colleague and great friend Bruno Cabanes, who is going to do give a lecture today on “The Great War, Grief and Memory;” and he’s the author of a really terrific book called, in English, , on what happened at the end of the war to the soldiers and to France. And to the dead of the Great War one must also add all those killed by the pandemic of the Spanish flu — maybe two or three times more murderous than World War I; probably twenty million people were actually killed by the Spanish flu epidemic in 1918. But, according to me, they mean nothing if one does not consider them in the relationship with private and collective mourning; and that’s the topic of today’s class. In the first part of my discussion I would like to — my perspective will be rather general. So, the concept of communities in mourning, coined by Jay Winter, is a very useful one as a means to grasp the scale of mourning after World War One in its entirety. So, she had been brought up with the idea that in some ways it was her duty, as a child, and I would say as a young girl, which is not the same, as a young girl, to do so. Second specificity: death was also experienced by the soldiers in a very solitary way. But here it must be seen specifically in the light of both the extreme violence of this war and in the light of the religious rituals that were still very important in France, before the outbreak of World War One. Nobody knows, but the enormous amount of energy many French families spent to have this decree finally signed shows in itself the psychological sufferings caused by distance and prolonged absence. The first one can be presented as a kind of nationalization of mourning. A kind of war tourism appeared during the conflict itself and develops in the 1920s and 1930s; just refer, if you’re interested by that topic, to the book written by David Lloyd, , published in 1998.These new sites of memory, or to use the famous terminology coined by Pierre Nora, these new , were often represented on objects, paintings and pictures, and a number of ceremonies were organized to pay tribute to the dead, especially on Armistice Day each year. In most countries, except Germany and except Russia, the cult of the Unknown Soldier was extremely popular in the 1920s. It appeared almost at the same time in Paris and London in 1920; in Washington, DC, Rome and Brussels in 1921; and in Prague and Belgrade in 1922. And the ceremonies of November 11th, 1920, brought hundreds of thousands of weeping people into the streets of Paris, many encouraged to believe that the coffin that passed actually before them contained the body of the man they had lost. He was unmarried, had only a few relatives. He was first considered missing in action, and his body was identified only in spring 1917. Some ground from the battlefield, from the Somme, was brought back to Creil and exposed in a room, along with — I don’t know if you can see that here clearly — with fragments of shells and other material souvenir of the Great War."
649,history,hist-276,lecture-17,"A plethora of Far Right and fascist organizations emerged in the wake of World War I. Economic depression, nationalism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia all played a part in this upsurge. On the left, the tension between communist revolutionaries and socialist reformers was reconciled, for a time, in the Popular Front government of Leon Blum. While the Popular Front would eventually fall, it pioneered many of the reforms and progressive measures that French workers enjoy today.","Okay, obviously France in the 1920s and ’30s has to be seen in terms of the international situation in Europe, and particularly the rise of fascism. Mussolini was on the cover of  eight different times in this country. In the case of France, what happens in the 1920s and 1930s, and particularly culminating on this day that I’ll talk about, February 6th, 1934, you can see the origins of that before World War One, in Boulanger and in the case of the anti-Dreyfusards. And this would be a scene that would be very important under Vichy, in the collaborationist years of World War Two as well. Another, the Croix-de-Feu, the Cross of Fire, attracted war veterans. Moreover, the French Right — I’ve already made it clear — they hate parliamentary regimes. And if Charles Mauras and the other Action Française people wanted a king, there weren’t very many likely candidates. And they’re all virulently nationalist; when you’re talking about the annexation of the left bank of the Rhine or when Hitler’s talking about elbow’s room, , elbow room, expansion room, for the German population, it is part of this theme of aggressive nationalism, and that also ties into the kind of xenophobia that is behind this entire movement. And, of course, Hitler runs into some difficulty, very minor, with German populations because he begins to use euthanasia as a tool of the state and to kill people who are handicapped or mentally retarded, as well as Jews, and gypsies, and gays, right along the way. And again, I said this before but it’s true, if you look at the whole period, 1914 to 1944 or ‘45, it’s a thirty years war because basically Europe is still at war and it’s a war waged on different levels — on the intellectual level, the newspaper violent headlines level, and battles in the street. When the new head of the government, Daladier, whom you can read about, called Chiappe telling him of his dismissal the policeman refused to be sent to Morocco and promised that he would be in the street, suggesting to Daladier not a fear of unemployment, that he was going to be in the street because he is unemployed, but a promise to lead the overthrow of the Republic. And when Jaurès was killed on the 31st of July, 1914, Léon Blum was the logical successor of Jaurès. Léon Blum was Jewish, and he was an intellectual. And what is interesting is that the strikes take the labor federations and the Communist Party by surprise. And they don’t want to lose the influence of the party. They don’t like it — what kind of Republic is this? France was a more agricultural country than, say, Germany, or the United States, or Britain, and so the Depression comes later and it stays longer; though the U.S. doesn’t get out of the Depression really until the armistice of World War Two. Ideologically, the reformist Socialist Party and the Communists remain a world apart. Léon Blum is not going to say, “occupy permanently the factories; take over the means of production, that’s all there is to it” — no, he wasn’t going to do that. The Italians tried out their tanks there."
650,history,hist-276,lecture-18,"For decades after the end of World War II the question of French collaboration with the Nazis was obscured. One of the reasons for this was the desire of de Gaulle and others to downplay the central role of communists in resisting the occupation. In fact, many French civilians were involved to greater or lesser degrees in informing upon their fellows or otherwise furthering the interests of the German invaders. Under the Vichy regime, right-wing politics in France developed an ideological program founded upon an appeal to nationalism, the soil, and the rejection of perceived decadence.","Today I want to talk about the fall of France and then mostly about collaboration, and next time I’m going to talk about resistance; so, the first part just sort of briefly. But they’d attached a number of tanks to each division. And the word “collaboration,” the English word collaboration, a word that you all know used to mean simply what? And it was also the myth that was perpetuated by Charles de Gaulle, because for Charles de Gaulle, who assumed the kind of mantle of the resistance, what he needed to do was to make people forget the communist resistance and to see himself as this sort of mystical body of the French people, that as his voice crackled over the airwaves, for those who could hear it — and many people who hadn’t heard it claimed to have heard it, on the 18th of June, 1940 — that we must keep resisting. ”And, of course, it was not the case at all. Then they started tracking down people with rather bad histories. But here you’ve got historians, and historians have a much greater public role in France than in the U.S; people care about history much more than they do in the U.S. And, so, Paxton became this expert witness in the trial of Touvier. Maurice Papon, he worked in a prefecture in the Gironde, in Bordeaux, and he was a functionary. So, from having no official memory of Vichy, no — but only sites of memory that had to do with the resistance — which I’m going to talk about next time — that since, before you were born, but France underwent this re-evaluation — and that was important for people who had lost family members because of Vichy. They tried, of course, at the beginning — and they did this in Bulgaria too, and in Hungary. It was not done by the Germans who would’ve been very happy to do it. And for this guy, his father was taken away with a wife after the war. And for people like that there was sort of a satisfaction. Whereas in voting Left in France — you could do a map and place a map on that, and place it on a map of de-Christianization, and the French Revolution, and the elections of 1849 — I’ve said this before — and there’d be a remarkable similarity and hardly any changes at all. That’s not true in terms of collaboration, nor is it true in resistance. And you think, how can a smart guy like that ever do these things? Third, and this is a subset but it should stand by itself, is anti-Semitism, that the French Vichy regime — let me interject the fact that it’s only in November of 1942 that the Germans occupy the Vichy zone, because the resistance is mobilizing — that the French put in laws about Jews, depriving Jews of rights that the Germans didn’t even ask them to do, in terms of saying, “well, if you are Jewish because your grandmother or your grandfather was Jewish” — I don’t remember exactly the laws. But the laws in some ways are even harsher than the infamous Nuremberg laws of the Reich. The High Command of the French Army was replete with anti-Semitism, had always been that way. It doesn’t come from people elected to represent the Haute-Garonne, Toulouse’s region, and sitting in the Palais Bourbon, in the political club, authority comes from the top down — this is the 1920s, ’30s and ’40s — and that’s what they viewed as a very good thing. And why they begin to change, and the origins of the resistance, and who resisted is a fascinating topic, and that’s the one we’re gonna do next Monday, I’m going to New Mexico between then and now but I will see you on Monday."
651,history,hist-276,lecture-19,"If the extent of French collaboration during World War II has been obscured, so too has the nature of resistance. Although the communist Left represented the core of the resistance movement, resistors came from any different backgrounds, including in their ranks Catholics, Protestants, Jews and socialists. Unlike the relationship between de-Christianization and right-wing politics, in the case of the resistance there is no clear correlation between regional locations and cells of resistors. It has been argued that the definition of resistance itself should be broadened to include the many acts of passive resistance carried out by French civilians during the occupation.","Okay, I want to just finish off, because trying to do the collaboration in one week is not easy. French  —  were the heads of the , that is France is divided into, that is the whole structure of education from the universities down to the , to kindergarten, the demissed Jews from their post — and you met one of them, Marc Bloch, whom I said lost his job twice; he lost it in Strasbourg and then in Montpellier. Now, again they didn’t have to do this, the Germans weren’t saying — they had other things, security and things that they were worried about — “security” in quotes — but it was just done because they wanted to do it. And it’s the same thing in the legal profession where lots of magistrates, as in the case of Hitler’s Germany, in Weimar before Hitler came to power, the magistrates, many of them, most of them, had been trained under the Second Reich, that is before World War I, and they flocked to the extreme right very quickly. Now, the French record is not very good, even compared with other countries, the spectacular exception being Slovakia, which was certainly one of the worst places you could possibly have been as a Jew, and not too far from Auschwitz, across the frontier in Poland, which turned over both natives and foreign Jews to Nazis right away. Now, there’s another thing going on too, just look at the map. And toward the end of his life two facts about his life came out. And as I began the lecture last time, Charles de Gaulle was determined that the France of the Fourth Republic was to be built around his large body, and part of that was to try to convince people in France and abroad that the Gaullists were the only resistors and that they had heard the crackle of his voice, imposing voice, across the airwaves on June 18th, 1940. But there’s several obvious reasons for that. He got out, he survived, he became a cake producer. Well, who knows, but Protestants were over-represented in the resistance. Now, priests, I don’t know what you — priests and school teachers are kind of opinion makers or whatever the phase is; they are people that, along with the mayor, that sort out problems in a village. By the way, the term  means basically organized resistors. One is right near Clermont-Ferrand, here. And there, there was a whole bunch of these people up there and they had some fairly considerable arms — this isn’t the pitched battle — but then they get denounced; there are always people that are going to sell other people’s lives away, there’s no question about it. But the resistance, whether they were Gaullists, or whether they were communists, or whether they had no affiliation at all, , the resistance depended on neighborhood, small town and above all village networks; thus the role of the school teacher or some kind of local leader. In the prefecture of the Ardèche there was — they’d have this big sort of joyous celebration when the town is liberated and then they noticed, some of the resistors noticed that all sorts of people had dressed up in fancy military clothes and all of that; they had nothing to do with the resistance at all. There were about 24,000  who were killed in the liberation of France. But this is before the computer, the quiet violence of the computer, and these were lists that were done by hand, and she simply went into the drawers and ripped them up, ripped up the lists, and put the scrap paper not in the wastepaper basket but in her pocket and went out and deposited it in the first  or garbage can that she found."
652,history,hist-276,lecture-1,"Professor Merriman lists the books on the syllabus, and offers a brief  of each of them. Three of the principal themes of the course will be national identity, linguistic identity, and the consequences of the two world wars. Although the course will consider some well-known historical figures, such as Hitler and de Gaulle, it will also examine the individual histories of ordinary people.","This is History of France, 1871 to the Present. And my name’s Merriman, and we meet Monday and Wednesday in this room, which is a pretty good room. And what this is, is that if you want to take the section in French, you should have about an equivalent of 130, and the discussion’s in French and a couple of the books — I’ll talk about them in a minute — you can read in French, the others you read in English. And this person looked at me and said, “Well the maid was from Dijon.” Well mommy used to take us to Chamonix for the — .” is a book that I became obsessed with, oh, about five or six years ago. Emilie Carles was born in abject poverty in the High Alps, in the  near Gap, up really high in the mountains here, and she became a schoolteacher as a common sort of means of social ascension for a poor person from a village. It was a phenomenal thing, and she ended up on this very famous French television show called , with Bernard Pivot, who said that she was one of the most interesting people that he’d ever had on his show. Then he went back to a farm that he owned in the Limousin, in the Creuze, up here near a boring place I used to work called Gerais. I forgot one, I forgot to put one in; no, no here it is. They shot the men, and they put the women and the children in the church, and they killed them. There were riots Limoges that they were pardoned. My kids have been in French schools for many years so I know about these places. And it’s about the attempt — the role of the Catholic Church in Vichy is not a very savory one, the French hierarchy and many priests, but many priests were very heroic and when this particular priest, who was a real live guy called  Jean, Father John, tried to hide this boy in the school so he wouldn’t be arrested and sent off to the camps, but he was denounced by somebody who was in the militia, the  is what it’s called, which is sort of paramilitary thugs that worked for Vichy; and, of course, it does not have a happy ending. And then the last film, most of you won’t have seen it, called ; hate, I guess you would translate that as hate, or hatred. Okay, one theme I’m interested in is — well let me tell you about lectures, first of all. Before he was guillotined he dictated his life. When Bernadette of Lourdes, in 1856, believed that she saw the Virgin Mary, of course they had to have somebody come and translate there what was a mountain patois influenced by Spanish. And that was 1970 — more about that in a second. And his father was denounced by a policeman, by a policeman. I was the only person frisked going into Notre Dame, literally, that I saw. But, anyway, so the other thing that happened was a friend of mine, I’m very proud to say, called Robert Paxton, wrote a book called , and he had to use captured German documents because the French documents weren’t open, they were not available, because the big secret of collaboration should not be known."
653,history,hist-276,lecture-20,"Anti-Americanism in France has historically been directed toward the U.S. government and corporations rather than American citizens. In the wake of World War II, the Marshall Plan for rebuilding Europe was considered by many to be a form of American imperialism. Along with the establishment of American military bases on French soil, the years after World War II bore witness to a great influx of American products, notably refrigerators and Coca-Cola. French concern over American cultural imports persists today, and has extended to include policies aimed at keeping the French language free of English words.","I don’t know if you’ve been following the events in France in the last couple of days. So, as a matter of fact when I was teaching in Rouen — I do a course, I’ve done it the last couple of Mays, a course that’s a couple of weeks there, and the first day I was doing it — I’d just only met my students and we went to a demonstration against Sarkozy, in front of the Palace of Justice, and we were outnumbered by the CRS. I’m going to be, this afternoon, calling my student pals in Rouen and finding out what’s going on with them. There were angry outbursts even against the Marshall Plan. There were pro-American intellectuals who made the case in the very beginning that the American path was the way to go. I agree with those people who said that they had great faith in humanity until the cell phone; and plus my daughter’s lost three of them already. But, again, you have to put this in the context of the times, and that’s what I guess what historians try to do. Now, remember, the guy who got rid of the U.S. bases in France was Charles de Gaulle, who was anything but a communist, who was completely opposite of a communist, but his view, as we’ll see, was that France had to maintain its status as a great power, had to have a neutral path and influence in places where French was spoken, particularly in West and North Africa, and in the Middle East in parts, in Lebanon, and things like that. In 1952, at the time of the visit of U.S. General Matthew Ridgeway to take control of NATO forces, there were huge demonstrations against the United States. And I’m not criticizing these companies, am I? Now, people that defended the Tour Montparnasse, which is identified with Chicago and the skyscrapers, would say, “well, look, well people criticized the Tour d’Eiffel, the Eiffel Tower when it was built in 1888 and 1889”; and Zola was among those who signed saying this is awful, it must go. But the clothing that was identified with America was seen as being somehow un-French. Now, McDonald’s has tried to compromise in some ways, and if you go get a McDonald’s — and I won’t go in the place; well, I shouldn’t say that because we’re recording this, but I haven’t been in years in France — but they have these little salads with a few pieces of goat cheese in it, to go along with the two million calorie burger, and all that. And then what comes along now but Starbucks. The hotdog became the, in these times of these various commands."
654,history,hist-276,lecture-21,"France’s colonial territories were of very high importance after the embarrassment of occupation during World War II. Algeria, in particular, was a complicated case because it involved large numbers of French settlers, the . Despite international support for Algerian independence, right-wing factions in the military and among the colonizers remained committed to staying the course. After Charles de Gaulle presided over French withdrawal, the cause of the has remained divisive in French political life, particularly on the right.","Okay, by the way there was big trouble over the weekend in a suburb. And this, despite the insistence of Winston Churchill, for one, that the British Empire would not be dismembered. One has a tendency to say, well, the Communist Party represented Vietnamese nationalism, but there were other nationalists who weren’t communists, but the war — because the war ends — the way the war comes out one ends up talking a lot about communist nationalism. And, so, therefore France gets out of Vietnam, and one of the things that happened — by the way, my friend Mark Lawrence has an excellent book on this — is that already the French and the British in the late 1940s were getting the Americans to kind of do what they wanted. But that was nothing compared to Algeria, that was nothing at all. There is outrage in the French rightwing press. And this seems to be another humiliation, and what this does as it begins to harden the lines. And, so, within the army there begins to be not only discord but attempts to organize rightwing groups — they became known as the OAS, the secret army, that eventually tries to kill Charles de Gaulle himself, and launches a campaign of terror in France, and things that you can read about. But lots of people there were again these café owners, were people of modest of means who were simply caught in the middle of all of this. Now, on March 13th, 1958, a protest demonstration by French settlers, the , in Algiers, turned into a military led insurrection against the French government. And, so, the OAS, which had already existed, in reality they tried to kill de Gaulle."
655,history,hist-276,lecture-22,"Charles de Gaulle’s importance in postwar French political life was matched by his importance in the nation’s collective imagination. This authority was consciously contrived by de Gaulle, who wished to bear upon his figurative body the will of the French people to maintain the power of their nation in the face of a political environment characterized by the opposition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Ultimately, de Gaulle’s symbolic originality proved more lasting than his political innovations.","What happened at Villiers-le-Bel was that you got your basic cop car, coming along, and it wasn’t rolling aggressively, it was about fifty kilometers an hour, and these two young North-African extraction youths, without helmets, didn’t yield to the car. I have never been controlled, not once, not once. And, so, this incident, which involved a police car, was not coming in and sort of saying “up against the mall MF” and all this but, “let’s see your papers.” So, this was sort of the Gaullist take on this. Now, those of you who know anything about France before 1871, if this doesn’t sound like Napoleon, both N-I, Napoleon the First, and N-III, Napoleon the Third — it’s an obvious thing to say, but it’s still true — that in — there’s no need you should know this, but some of you do — 1799 on the 18th of Brumaire, Napoleon, with the help of the wily Abbe Sieyes, the priest, Sieyes, who wrote “What is the Third Estate,” overthrow the Assembly. But Napoleon was perceived as somebody on the Left. Napoleon was only wounded three times, very lightly. But he never intended it as witticisms; the man had virtually no sense of humor. And that this kind of influence, a cultural influence and a political influence of being an honest broker between these two big colossal powers will help accentuate France’s existence as a great power, continued to exist as a great power. I think one of the nurses was Palestinian but I think the other ones were Bulgarian, I’m sure they were Bulgarian; I’m not sure about the Palestinian but I think so. His own family, by the way, his own family -ed him, his children did. And, so, this caused all sorts of problems. But it’s just my feeling, but I don’t know enough about it to say that’s a good idea, but I have the same kind of cultural feelings that he does about it. But although he was vehemently anti-communist, he did not want — he saw himself as again this honest broker in negotiating between these powers. The French Right couldn’t — what de Gaulle did is he took the nationalism of Napoleons, the Napoleons, which was a nationalism associated with the general liberal Left — the State will do good things for people — he transforms that in the evolution that you see in the Third Republic, the nationalism, moving to the nationalism of the Right, into the equivalent of the Sacred Union of World War One, into a nationalism, fundamentally a nationalism of the Right in France. But the most, the greatest legacy that he left is probably his style, that of the monarchical president, the monarchial president, the king of the republic, the idea that he represented France in a way that the Sun King had represented France, towering over France, and that overriding the interests of those he considered to be talkers, mere posers or talkers, including technocrats, the kinds of people who had emerged in part out of World War Two and out of the Fourth Republic. It was rather like FEMA, whatever they called it — did an amazing thing just a couple of weeks in California, they planted — the people in the room weren’t reporters they were FEMA employees, and they presented it as a press conference where one guy raised his hand and he said, “why is FEMA doing such a remarkable job this time around?”"
656,history,hist-276,lecture-23,"The student protests of May 1968 in France were linked to international protests against the American war in Vietnam and other political and social consequences of the Cold War. In many respects, the terrible condition of many schools in France that led students to revolt remains a problem. Recent attempts to impose American-style reforms on the university system have met with protests that echo some of the demands made in ‘68; although, other conditions for revolution seem as though they may never again be realized in the same way.","All right, I want to today talk about 1968, which I can even remember, though I wasn’t in France in 1968. And you could see them from the 16th  and there were ladies in their fur coats and they’re flashing rings, and they were there to express their solidarity with the General, to whom all of this seemed something just strange, from another planet, that he couldn’t comprehend, didn’t want to deal with, just wished it was all going to go away. And that was an enormous, enormous event for people of my generation. And you also had this extraordinary ambiguity, in thinking about this, or ambivalence, because if you were basically against the sort of technological, super-powered society of fast cars, and the Americanization of European culture, if you believed strongly against that, what kind of job is there going to be at the end of the tunnel for you?You can’t be a professional militant your entire life. In 1964 two percent of the university students were sons or daughters of workers and peasants, two percent in 1964. I have a friend, in fact a Gaullist with whom I waited in line to get into Notre Dame for the Charles de Gaulle affair, who was supposed to take — he’s a lawyer and he was taking an advanced degree, and he lived in the suburbs and he stayed in — the prosperous suburbs, fairly prosperous — but he stayed in Paris one night because the metros closed, the buses closed, and if you didn’t make the 12:32 then you had a long walk; and I’ve walked back to that suburb and hitchhiked back and all of that — some funny stories about that but now is not the time. Students conversed in Latin, Latin was a living language. And there was already a very strong university in Lyon, and there was X and there were other universities. This is also tied — and this is a point I stupidly forgot to mention early — the women’s movement, although not terribly dominant in France, still essentially limited — this is probably an exaggeration, but to the middle class feminists, influenced by Simone de Beauvoir, the women’s movement also meant that lots of women put forth their claims; and again, as I said, that the vast majority of the students are bourgeois students, they’re upper class students and so — but that still was part of it. There was so much that seemed to have to be changed that it was very frustrating. It happened at Columbia and places like that. And these things were easily transformed into barricades. Before that even, on May 6th during the fighting, there were 1,422 arrests, et cetera, et cetera. It was the largest mobilization of workers in French history, without any question, even more than 1936. And they’re both fighting against the brutalization, as they would have put it, of human relations, is that capitalism seemed to be simply perpetuating this favored society in which the rich do very, very well, thank you very much, and the are full of only people who are well connected; basically that was always the case, the big, fancy schools. Lyon II, places like Lyon II, as opposed to Lyon I and Lyon III, is going to do very, very well; Toulouse is going to do very well under this system. They said, “well, you can do history of urban France,” because I’ve written books on urban France, “and then you can do the 1920s and ’30s.” Now, in our three classes on the 1920s and ’30s there were 400 students. And there was another one in the municipal library in Lyon. But then some were just brilliant and some were terrible. And then they go off into a different line. In the end that generation was right, I would like to say, in opposing U.S. policies, in trying to create or insist on a more human world, humane world, in industrial relations and in the university."
657,history,hist-276,lecture-24,"French culture is threatened both by European Unification and the rise of xenophobia within France itself. The defeat of the referendum on the European Constitution testified to the dissatisfaction of many people in rural France with the economic realities of the new international community. Racist policies targeting residents of France’s poor suburbs threaten the national ideal of liberty, equality, and fraternity. These problems remain to be resolved if France is to preserve its unique identity.","I want to talk about a couple of things at the beginning, and then I want to talk about the suburbs, to end with, because that’s going to be a big problem in the future. I’ll tell you a funny little story that has to do with this, in some ways. And many people, many ordinary people — not in Paris, if you’re working with the George Bush dollar and trying to afford a single café in Paris — but for very many ordinary people the euro, that is the currency that became January 1st, the year 2002 — I actually wrote something about the transition to that currency — that this currency to most people seems like what you say in French is an, it’s a sting. And the government can trot out all the information they want to try to show there hasn’t been massive inflation due to the Euro; and that’s simply false, because things that people buy in their lives — I don’t mean rich people but I mean ordinary people — have become extraordinarily high and expensive, because of the euro. And we can debate, we could go on and on about it. That didn’t happen two years ago and that’s not a good sign. But the great players were Thuram, Zidane, Desailly, these were the really great ones. But happily most people in France celebrated joyously because they certainly are French. And the damage was far less than, for example, in L.A. during the Rodney King riots in 1992, after the police who beat up this guy, on camera, beat up this minority guy from downtown L.A. The L.A. suburbs are not where the under-privileged people live. And when there were attacks on buildings they were attacks at night so nobody would be in the buildings. He referred to the rioters as “riff-raff” or even “scum” — , a word that I’ve used before; , scum, which can — it can also be “tough guy” but it means “scum” more. I did a book on this a long time ago, not just on that word but on some of this stuff. It was a strategy that Charles Pasqua, who had been a Minister of Interior long ago and tried to use, and had not worked, but it worked this time around. You can’t get teachers to teach there because there is violence; not big-time violence but there’s violence. This was discovered actually about ten years also that in some of the neighborhoods in Paris, and Montmartre, and in the 18th and 20th , but above all in the 20th, that the white population voted overwhelmingly in some areas for the National Front, in part because they were afraid of the fact that they would be minorities in their own  and all of this. And they’ve been controlled so many times. And I don’t dress any differently than they do, as you might have been able to tell. The red belt remains a dream of the past. You can’t imagine the kind of thing that the Americans want to do, or some Americans want to do, build this huge wall, a new Berlin wall, between Mexico and the United State. But this isn’t a problem that’s going to go away; and one shouldn’t see it as a problem, it’s a challenge, and because France believes deeply in the tradition in this course, the history of France and liberty, fraternity, and equality. So, be sure to know where you’re supposed to go for your final, okay?"
658,history,hist-276,lecture-3,"Despite various attempts at reform, France remains the most centralized state in Europe. The organization of the country around the Parisian center was originally a consequence of the French Revolution, which gave birth to the departmental regions. These regions have retained an oppositional relationship towards the metropolitan center. In 1875, an enduring republic was formed despite the competing claims of the Comte de Chambord and the Orleanists. This republic owed its founding largely to support from workers and peasants in the various non-Parisian departments.","I’m going to talk about the centralization of the French State and the question of why Paris — and that’s kind of fun to talk about — and the role of Paris in centralization, and the particular role of Paris in French economic, political, social and cultural life. And, then, in the last twenty minutes I’ll talk about why this sort of strange man, the former “miracle baby,” as he was called after his birth, the Comte de Chambord, did not become King of France, Henri V, and why France ended up a republic, and how; and, that has something to do with the centralization of the French State. A Rastignac was — it was before this course, but was the central figure, or one of them, in Balzac’s novel , , and he’s a sort of a somewhat poor noble from the Charente in the west of France who’s going to hit the big time, and wants to sleep with all the right ladies and become wealthy without doing any work, and he became sort of a symbol for this aggressive, provincial, in this case a sort of poor noble who has to get to Paris to make the big time, because the big time could only be there. And Balzac, to go back to Balzac, he put it the way Parisians view the provinces, and this is still the case. And, so, Louis XIV, who liked to call himself the Sun God, a modest megalomaniac, he sends out officials into the provinces to enforce his will, and these dudes are called intendents — but that doesn’t matter, you don’t have to remember that. But, what they do is they increase the power of the center, of the government. The only big change came in 1960 when they consolidated the ones around Paris, because of the growth of the Paris region, as you can see there. They’re named after rivers and they don’t all — they’re not all the same size. The point is that the revolution, in order to defeat its enemies, further centralizes the state, and then along comes the little corporal, the little general, the little megalomaniac, Napoleon, N One. I mentioned it the first day because that’s where lots of people were hung. You would like a bridge across your river, wouldn’t you?” And, so, every government that comes to power, they say, well we’re going to do something about this. And as France held its breath, because they wanted a boy, this miracle baby was born, . So, and also because of the close association of the monarchy, and particularly the Legitimists, they’re called Legitimists, the Bourbons with the church — you’ve got fertile ground in areas that were still practicing religion, and we’ll talk more about that another time. And these are big crosses that are put out, usually outside the villages. And the key to his strength, besides the church, are the nobles. Now, there was even a group of nobles who believed that they could be elected, that if you had an election people would actually vote to restore the monarchy. And he went back to his castle, anti-Semitic jokes and card-playing buddies."
659,history,hist-276,lecture-5,"Religion in France after the Revolution can be understood in terms of two forms of de-Christianization. The first of these is political, and takes place in the  separation of church and state. The second is a decline in religious practice among individual citizens. While the history of the former change is well documented, the latter is a more ambiguous phenomenon. Despite the statistical decline in religious participation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Catholicism in particular continues to play a significant role in the cultural imagination, or , of many French people.","Okay, I’m going to talk about religion today, yes, and what I’m going to first — well, I’ll talk just a little bit about people who weren’t born into the Catholic Church. The vast majority of the population of France at the time, in the course, until say 1960, were born Catholic. How do you do that, how do you know what — whether people went to church or not? But, so I don’t know if that would be a statistic in this kind of evolution, but basically what — in the Catholic Church babies have had to be — I don’t know if it’s still the case — but had to be baptized within the first three days of birth; thus all these certificates that have — remember the , where people say, “I see this baby, the baby is alive,” and they baptize the baby so if the baby dies — and remember babies died all the time, after childbirth. There are parts of France that have always had a lot of priests, Finestère, Brittany, for one example. When people start naming their babies, when they stop naming them after saints, that tells you something. In some of those places the monument to the dead is not only not near the church that no one goes to, but will have a broken cross, asking that same question that Voltaire once asked about the Lisbon earthquake: “if there is a God, how could he or she have allowed this to happen?”And even those monuments are symbols of a decline in what had been assumed by the church, and indeed assumed by the state, of that old-time religion. But the cities were basically lost to the Catholic Church, with some exceptions. And this is background to the separation of church and state in 1905. Now, this, to be sure, is a rather pessimistic, from the point of view of the church, assessment, and perhaps overly so, because there has been recent work that has described in many parts of France, and in parts of Catholic Germany also, a revival of intense religiosity that has a lot to do with miracles. And we used to like to go to a — if you can imagine me as a failed altar boy, you’re looking at one, but we used to like to go out to the girls school and help the priests with the mass and all that, just to have a look at these women who we had basically never seen before. And their teaching was valued for what they did. Now, to be sure, the Catholic Church had not done itself any great favors with the Papal Syllabus of Errors in 1864 that said that modernity, liberalism, democracy, helping workers, anything, was bad, and it made the church look pretty ridiculous. Now, I got interested in this, because I was writing a book about this place, and so I went to all the archives, of course, and I went to all the newspapers, the Catholic newspaper and to a very anti-clerical socialist newspaper, and I read the accounts of all the incidents in which that happened, in all these other villages, in this part of France in which tensions between Protestants and Catholics had always been very high because of the wars of religion in the sixteenth century, the seventeenth century, and in the eighteenth century. So it had a place there, even though it never happened. So, because churches do provide charity still and help organize lives for very elderly people, this is very sad."
660,history,hist-276,lecture-6,"The Industrial Revolution in France is often said to have been entirely overshadowed by British industrial development. This analysis is inaccurate because it ignores the significance of domestic and other non-factory occupations. Indeed, it was the class of artisan workers, rather than industrial factory workers, who were first responsible for the organization of labor movements. One of the great innovations of the factory was the imposition of industrial discipline, against which many workers rebelled, often in the form of strikes.","Today I want to talk about large-scale industrialization and workers. But, well into the 1870s you still have something like 75,000 embroiderers, mostly women again, living in the hinterland of Nancy. But in the north, that is certainly the case. And the other big industrial region, of course, the biggest, is the Paris region. So, you had these fine clothes still being made by — put together by single women or single men, I don’t know if they’re married or not, but working by themselves at home, that are part of the artisanal structure of Paris; where, if you went into the hinterland of Paris or into the industrial suburbs there you have the dirty industries, soap production, chemical production, that people don’t want in the city and the city values are so high that if you want space you’re going to build them outside — more about that when I talk about Paris. So but these places are rather spread apart. But there was industrial production of some kind almost anywhere that you could go. And, because it has now been annexed by Germany — that is, not now but in the 1870s, I mean in 1871 — I didn’t talk about all the textile production in Alsace, but there was lots of textile production there. And, as in the case of Britain, that is, the trains help encourage investment because people can see trains, they can ride trains, and they look like something that’s going to lead France into this new, brand new industrial world, and so that helps accentuate the number of people who have something to invest, investing in railroads. As a matter of fact, one of the things that probably hurts French industry during exactly the period we’re talking about, that is the 1870s, ’80s and the early 1890s, is the fact that French capitalists begin investing in railroads, but in other places, in Italy, in Russia, and in Spain, where the railroads are to a great extent built by French capital. And, so, those continuities are still very important. So, what I want to talk to you about now is how workers viewed what was happening to them. And, so, people who were born into a life of work, a life of hard, difficult work, that was one — you ended — you were born into the jobs that you would get. I’m writing a book about a guy whom I’ll tell you about some day, who really — he said that love can make you hate. And, so, all of a sudden in Paris in the 1830s, ’40s and ’50s there’s all sorts of wagons being pushed through the street with beautifully made clothes on them, going for practically nothing, because there’s so many other tailors making suits, and the price, the wages these guys get — Marx was right about, only about that, insofar as his assessment of wages — artisans are making less money, their world is falling apart. In the 1820s and 1830s, when artisans went on strike, they knew the boss, the master. He is a symbol of this structure of a large-scale industrialization that they can’t control. And he is off in his chateau, on his boat in Normandie, or something like that, but he has been — the voice of him is now the foreman. When you see — and that’s not the only reason, because you need factories for big machines; these machines I can never — I’d forget how to work them."
661,history,hist-276,lecture-7,"The history of socialism in France can be understood in terms of the competition between revolutionary socialists and reform socialists. The former advocated abandoning electoral politics, while the latter attempted to improve conditions for workers by means of reforms within the political system. These two attitudes found figureheads in Jules Guesdes and Paul Brousse, respectively. Reform socialists and revolutionary socialists are united under the leadership of Jean Jaures, whose organizing efforts define and influence French socialism well into the twentieth century.","Well, today I’m going to talk a little bit about syndicalism, but mostly about socialism, and then Monday I’m going to talk about anarchism. So, this was, while it was scary for a conservative elite, it is energizing for both people who want to capture control of the state, that is, revolutionary socialists and, indeed, reform socialists, as we’ll see in a minute, but their means were different, and anarchists who wanted to destroy the state. He was sentenced to five years in jail after the Commune. But the goals of creating this party were revolutionary, they are not reformist. And one of the interesting things about the Parti Ouvrier — just call it the POF — the Parti, well just the working class, the Worker’s Party, French Worker’s Party, is — which also suggests that the role of personality in all of this — is they do very well in specific regions. So, Guesde is always sort of on the outside looking in, even within the context of the socialist movement. And here’s where the railroads come into play. Now, he was all over the place, basically. And, so, municipal socialism is one of those things that emerges from these reform socialist parties. He somehow ended up marrying the daughter of a Russian prefect of police. And the general strike, he calls it a myth, a myth not in a sense that it doesn’t exist, but a myth in the sense that it’s a sort of overwhelming, given of the possible, that can motivate people to take militant, working class action, and that one day everybody would simply put down their tools, put down their — take off their work outfit, and shut capitalism down by simply saying, “we’re not going to work anymore,” and the whole thing collapsed. Now, how did the Socialist Party become unified in 1905? He was third behind Henri Bergson, a famous guy, and a forgotten school-teacher. His pockets were always crammed with papers and indeed with books — he had rather big pockets. He, unlike one of his friends, Viviani, who took lessons at the Comédie-Française, and practiced them — there used to be, one of my colleagues used to practice his lectures in one of the parking lots, and he’d look at himself in the mirror, these rearview mirrors; and I don’t know why I thought of that. And he could take his crowd on dizzying verbal flights. You’d come into a room with Bart Giamatti — and I often didn’t agree with him about some things, but almost always did, and revered him, and still miss him terribly — but he could — at the end of talking to him, everybody would kind of agree, at least the momentum to find conciliation, and to agree to this common goal that they all shared was a fantastic, fantastic experience. And he was on the road constantly, and he became a voice of progress and reform and reason in a world increasingly gone mad."
662,history,hist-276,lecture-8,"Anarchists, unlike syndicalists and other leftists, seek to destroy the state rather than to capture state power for themselves. Emile Henry and other late nineteenth-century radicals inaugurated the modern practice of terrorism in their individualism and their indiscriminate choice of civilian targets. Despite the terrifying consequences of individual acts of terrorism, these pale in comparison to the consequences of state terrorism.","I’m going to talk about anarchism today, and especially I’m going to talk about the life and death of one guy, somebody I don’t admire, Émile Henry; but, in a way he represents some aspects of the origin of modern terrorism in late nineteenth-century Paris. ”Now, Proudhon was followed by two important Russian anarchists, both of whom I won’t talk about, but who are extremely interesting, and both of whom were nobles, one the guy called Peter Kropotkin and the other the terrifying, quite terrifying Mikhail Bakunin, and they become quite important. There was a fancy ball going on, and he knew he could not get past the guards to get close enough to claim any victims. For Kropotkin and before him Proudhon, the goal was the primitive, the goal was sort of communities that would exist without the state. Kropotkin had lived in the French Jura mountains, in the east, and also in Switzerland, and their watchmakers seemed to get along fine without the intrusion of the state. Everything that is not legal is good for us. He was examined in physics, math and chemistry, and he would put some of the latter to use, as we shall see. He was classified as , that is, he could be admitted. And it was said later that he vowed vengeance on bourgeois society, blah-blah-blah. His two targets were private property and authority, “two vicious germs,” as he called them, that formed the base of contemporary societies that, he wrote, “have to be destroyed, eradicated from social life.” In contrast to Vaillant, who loved the people — Vaillant was the guy executed for throwing the tack bomb — Malato remembered Émile only loved the idea; he felt a marked estrangement from the ignorant and servile plebs, plebeians, a feeling distinctive, also, of a number of literary and artistic anarchists, by whom he met no less a painter than Camille Pissarro, who was an anarchist. He was described later, after his death, as the Saint-Just of anarchy. And, so, they carry it through the first courtyard. And I went up there because I got to see, I got to see. But, when you walk out of this — that’s how you got in, that’s 1894 — when you walk out of this, you turn right and there is the Park of Belleville, and down below the Place de la Roquette where he would lose his head, and he looked out — he was lucky, he couldn’t see the Tour Montparnasse, which didn’t then exist, but he could see symbols that he hated. Twenty people were wounded, of whom one later died. He also had — his knife had poison on it, as well. Now, was this a form of indirect suicide? He’d fallen in love with the wife of an anarchist; and her building is still there too, ironically not far away from the place where he was executed. And I obviously detest everything that Émile Henry stood for, but I’ve tried to understand his hatred. The two interact dynamically and need each other. And, certainly, this is not a course in political science, but the reaction of the United States government and other governments to the horrible, horrible attacks on September11th are a pretty good example of that."
663,history,hist-276,lecture-9,"Two of the major crises of nineteenth-century France, the Boulanger Affair and the Dreyfus Affair, can be understood in terms of the rising forces of anti-Semitism and Far Right politics. The German conquest of Alsace and Lorraine, in particular, fueled nationalist and right-wing sentiments, especially in rural France. Political orientations and prejudices were formed by the popular media of the time, such as illustrated periodicals and patriotic songs.","I want today to talk about two very well known crises in the Third Republic. But I agree with the interpretation that views the Boulanger Affair as the emergence of the far Right in France, events that parallel, for example, the rise of the far Right in Austria, and in other places as well, and particularly the sort of propaganda campaign, the anti-Semitism, and the sort of street thug tactics are rather similar to movements that we would become all too familiar with, not personally of course, but in the 1920s and 1930s. So, this is one of the big images of simply — of instability. But yet, I mean, this is to exaggerate because the Third Republic does provide stability for all of these great affairs. He became the Director of the Infantry at the War Office and his superiors noted that he had a taste for clumsy intrigue, and complained about the civilians, or the , as they were called, the Peking people, the civilians, and they were treated with contempt by the military; and of course the rule in the French Army, really all the way through to the Algerian War, has been this tension between the officer corps, very, very rightwing, and the civilian population — thus the attempts to kill de Gaulle himself, in the time of the Algerian situation. And then he goes upstairs with his mistress, to a nearby hotel, and the opportunity is past. And while he hesitates, as someone once wrote, his enemies do not. They eliminate the electoral procedure that allowed him to be elected. The Republic emerged strengthened by this crisis. And these people had their whole credit networks established, where they could get credit to get to their next stops, always through France. In France they would print out ballots; and, so, political lists would already be printed out, and you pick your list. There are real photos of the guy on his horse. And of course, one thing that he does is that he is able to — it plays off beautifully with the anti-Semites and their newspapers. The geographic shifts in social structure of Paris have transformed it, and henceforth, until 1968, the big demonstrations, , demonstrations, are those of the Right for the canonization of Joan of Arc, after 1920, against the Republic in 1934. It was out there much more in Germany than it was in France. Now, Drumont — Edward was his name, I never did say his first name — Edward, Edward, Drumont, his   had been very — at the forefront of denouncing the scandals of the Republic, arguing that the scandals were inherent in a Republic by its very form of — its very existence, and by the fact that it’s the Jews who dominate , that is the wall of money controlled by the Rothschilds and all of this, the usual kind of claims. In fact there’s a very good book called — written again by my former student Michael Burns, called , about the Dreyfus family, not just about Dreyfus — there’ve been probably forty books written about him; but it’s about his whole family. They convoke a secret court martial and find him guilty of treason."
664,history-art,hsar-252,lecture-10,"Professor Kleiner explores sepulchral architecture in Rome commissioned by the emperor, aristocrats, successful professionals, and former slaves during the age of Augustus. Unlike most civic and residential buildings, tombs serve no practical purpose other than to commemorate the deceased and consequently assume a wide variety of personalized and remarkable forms. The lecture begins with the round Mausoleum of Augustus, based on Etruscan precedents and intended to house the remains of Augustus and the new Julio-Claudian dynasty. Professor Kleiner also highlights two of Rome’s most unusual funerary structures: the pyramidal Tomb of Gaius Cestius, an aristocrat related to Marcus Agrippa, and the trapezoidal Tomb of Marcus Vergilius Eurysaces, probably a former slave who made his fortune overseeing the baking and public distribution of bread for the Roman army. Professor Kleiner concludes the lecture with a brief discussion of tombs for those with more modest means, including extensive subterranean . She also turns briefly to the domed thermal baths at Baia, part of an ancient spa and a sign of where concrete construction would take the future of Roman architecture.","So I thought it was appropriate for us all to tell Rome how much we love–Rome or Roma–how much we love her. I’ve loved Rome for as long as–for a long time, certainly from the age that you are now. We spoke on Tuesday about public architecture commissioned by the emperor Augustus, public architecture that we noted was made primarily out of marble, out of Luna or Carrara marble, that was quarried on the northwest coast of Italy itself, and the objective of it being to try to conjure up the relationship between the new Golden Age of Augustus and the Golden Age, fifth century B.C., of Periclean Athens. And then the outer wall–which you can also see in this view–the outer wall was faced with travertine, which is also interesting; not Luna marble, travertine blocks. I think I can make this clearer by showing you a plan of the Mausoleum of Augustus. I think the model–myself, I believe that the model comes from Italy, and that it’s a very interesting choice on the part of Augustus, because I think what it tells us is that Augustus may have wanted to build public buildings in Rome that conjured up ancient Athens, but when it came to deciding about how he wanted to be buried, he wanted to be buried in the manner of his Italian ancestors. And there are inscription plaques that have come to light, from the Mausoleum of Augustus, and I can show you a couple of them here, that do indicate that was exactly the case. The Appian Way, which you see–this is a Google Earth image once again where you can see a stretch of the Appian Way, or the Via Appia, that is modern asphalt, although there are remains–and I’ll show you later an example of this–there are remains of the polygonal masonry pavement that would have been there initially, looking very much like the pavement that we saw in Pompeii, for example. And you can see the Tomb of Caecilia Metella right over here. So they paid a little bit more in order to get that more expensive material for those critical details of the monument. We see it still inserted into the monument. In this Google Earth aerial view, we see what that structure looks like today. Whether there were a lot, we can’t be absolutely certain. But here it is, a Roman tomb, in the form of a pyramid. And what you see over here is a gateway that also belongs to the later Aurelian Walls. We have evidence for that, because two bases were found that seemed to belong to this tomb; in fact, it’s Cestius’ name, or members of his family, Cestius, you can see there, are named in these inscriptions. So it demonstrates to us again we are dealing with an aristocratic family. It was at that time, and even before, that an interest in things Egyptian came into Rome. But I show this to you just because it’s one of those more fascinating places in Rome. If you think the Tomb of Cestius is unusual, the weirdest tomb by far in Rome, from ancient Rome, is the one that I turn to now, and this is the Tomb of the baker Eurysaces, the Tomb of the baker Eurysaces that was put up in Rome in the late first century B.C. And that again is another tomb from the age of Augustus. So you have to go right up to the monument. So they are cylinders, vertically, and then horizontally. It probably is trapezoidal in shape because the tomb was located on a piece of property that was between two major roads of Rome that exited and entered the city at this particular point: the so-called Via Labicana and the Via Praenestina. And there are these wonderful models of many of them. This is a man who wanted to be remembered for posterity. And you need to think away the frieze up there, because the frieze was probably not on this side of the monument, although there was a frieze around the other three sides. In fact, it’s even better done here because you can see the shape of the knuckles and so on, underneath the garment, the very diaphanous garment that she wears. And, in fact, these dome-shaped ovens are still used in rural areas. And you can see it looks like a breadbasket. His name is plastered on three sides of the monument. But if you look at this carefully, you will see that what it looks like is as if these individuals are still alive and looking out of the window of their tomb, as if out of the window of a house; this very close association in the minds of the Romans between houses of the living and houses of the dead. We know they had thousands of slaves, literally thousands of slaves. So a concrete building, with a concrete dome, used as part of this spa."
665,history-art,hsar-252,lecture-12,"Professor Kleiner features the tumultuous year of 68-69 when Rome had four competing emperors. Vespasian emerged the victor, founded the Flavian dynasty, and was succeeded by his sons, Titus and Domitian. The Flavians were especially adept at using architecture to shape public policy. Professor Kleiner demonstrates that Vespasian linked himself with the divine Claudius by completing the Claudianum and distanced himself from Nero by razing the Domus Aurea to the ground and filling in the palace’s artificial lake. In that location, Vespasian built the Flavian Amphitheater, nicknamed the Colosseum, thereby returning to the people land earlier stolen by Nero. Professor Kleiner discusses the technical and aesthetic features of the Colosseum at length, and surveys Vespasian’s Forum Pacis and Titus’ Temple to Divine Vespasian. The lecture concludes with the Baths of Titus, Rome’s first preserved example of the so-called “imperial bath type” because of its grand scale, axiality, and symmetry.","We are finally at the Colosseum, the very icon of Rome. So the octagonal room, and also I mentioned to you other things in the villa, including a banqueting hall with a revolving ceiling. I also want to say with regard to Vespasian, not only was he a great military strategist, but he also seems to have been an extremely shrewd politician, someone who recognized that you could use architecture in the service of ideology–and that’s in fact what we’re going to see him doing today–and he starts this from the very beginning of his reign. It was made out of concrete; barrel-vaulted chambers made out of concrete. But it’s one way in which one can think about this sort of thing. Here’s another–here’s just comparing the podium of the Claudianum to the Porta Maggiore in Rome, just to remind you of the rusticated columns there, the rusticated drums of these engaged columns, and then at the uppermost part the way in which the upper part of the column and the capital are dressed smooth and seem to emerge. And that’s when I first made that point about the likelihood that the column–that we’re supposed to read this as the column completed inside, just waiting to break free; and we see the same thing, but a further elaboration of that here. And there are fragments of this structure there that give us a sense of what it looked like in antiquity. It was made of concrete, as we shall see. But he decided to raze it to the ground, for political reasons, to discredit Nero; and he hoped to gain favor with the populace. And what he did, smartly, was to say, “What I am going to do with this property? And clearly the experiments, the architectural experiments in the Augustan period, at the Theater of Marcellus, were very important in terms of this particular design; it basically follows the same general scheme. In this case, the Theater of Marcellus appears to have had three stories, only two of which are currently persevered. There were small and larger cages down here, and I’m going to show you what those looked like in a moment. Only that small section is preserved, and I can show you another view where we see the same. You can also see the seats, the , the wedge-shaped sections of those seats, the ; the 50,000 people packed in for this special event. The Colosseum, extremely famous in its own day, continued to be famous in antiquity. And this also shows you very well the way in which the wooden poles rested on the brackets, those wooden poles to serve to support the awning of the structure. You popped over there, you could walk in, in a flash; never a problem. And so I wanted to show you another amphitheater where they are well preserved, so you can get a better sense of what those substructures would have looked like in antiquity. Here’s another view where you can also get a great sense of these substructures, of the places where the animals were kept, and also of those openings in the ceiling that allowed them to be brought up above. The fact that that looked back to the architectural experiments, very early on, second, first centuries B.C., at the Sanctuaries of Jupiter Anxur at Terracina, and of Hercules Victor at Tivoli; it was that kind of thing that was being looked back to. And it’s interesting to see that it was that same plan, that idea of a great open rectangular space, with a temple as part of it, that was used–and with the temple put along one of the longer ends–that was used by Vespasian for his own forum in Rome, the so-called Forum Pacis; it’s sometimes referred to as the Templum Pacis, because we’re not actually sure how it was used. This area here, that’s labeled as the Forum of Nerva, wasn’t a forum at all, at this point, it was a street called the Argiletum–A-r-g-i-l-e-t-u-m. And that street, the Argiletum–and you can see it labeled up there–that street led into a part of Rome, a residential area of Rome, that I’ve referred to before, called the Subura, S-u-b-u-r-a. The Subura was again a place where there were a lot of–I’ve mentioned it again; there were there, a lot of apartment houses, mostly made out of wood: rickety apartment houses that were lived in by a large number of people, with lesser means. And there were consequently always fires there. So another Neronian innovation that remains important. So this combination of imported marbles used for the Forum Pacis in Rome. The reason that this idea came to the fore is that eventually, when the Argiletum was filled in with a forum by Vespasian’s second son Domitian, Domitian did build a forum that is in part preserved, and which we will look at next week I believe. But that forum had on the walls a series of columns with projecting entablatures. He wants to remind them when Nero was emperor of Rome, he had things in his villa that he would never have dreamed of sharing with you. A very large chunk of that frieze and entablature is still preserved today. And then the frieze itself is very interesting. And just a very quick review, to remind ourselves of its major features. And in what kind of building do I want to be buried? So we see experiments in private palace and tomb architecture, villa architecture that we don’t tend to see as much in public architecture. But what we see happening here is very momentous, and that is the lessons that were explored first in private architecture are being adopted in the most public of all Roman buildings, a bath building, and it’s being done in a very different way from the Colosseum. So clearly a very special portrait artist, probably hired to do these portraits; a portrait artist who may have been hired at great expense. There’s some attempt to depict their musculature. We know they had thousands of slaves, literally thousands of slaves. It is the so-called “Temple of Mercury” – that’s what the locals have long called it. I showed you this Etruscan attempt at making a round structure, with a dome, that was done, in this case, in stone, and although it was a valiant attempt, not all that successful. And we talked about the way in which that eventually transformed into the Roman ability to make the  at Pompeii. They would have been stuccoed over, which you can see, and then probably decorated with mosaic. This one up here, which of course is the  at Pompeii, to show you where all of this begins."
666,history-art,hsar-252,lecture-13,"Professor Kleiner investigates the major architectural commissions of the emperor Domitian, the last Flavian emperor. She begins with the Arch of Titus, erected after Titus’ death by his brother Domitian on land previously occupied by Nero’s Domus Transitoria. The Arch celebrated Titus’ greatest accomplishment–the Flavian victory in the Jewish Wars–and may have served as Titus’ tomb. Professor Kleiner also discusses the Stadium of Domitian, the shape of which is preserved in Rome’s Piazza Navona. Her major focus is the vast Imperial Palace on the Palatine Hill designed by the architect Rabirius and featuring Domitian as  (lord and god). Constructed from brick-faced concrete and revetted with multicolored imported marbles, this structure was divided into public and private wings, and was so magnificent that it served as the urban residence of all subsequent Roman emperors. The lecture concludes with the so-called Forum Transitorium, a narrow forum begun by Domitian and finished by his successor Nerva, which features a temple to Domitian’s patron goddess Minerva and a series of decorative columnar bays that create a lively in-and-out undulation that heralds the beginning of a “baroque” phase in Roman architecture.","Today’s lecture is entitled “The Prince and the Palace: Human Made Divine on the Palatine Hill.” And he did that by finishing the platform, and indeed the temple itself that we looked at last time, and that is the Temple of the Divine Claudius, the Claudianum, that had been begun by Agrippina the Younger. Once again you can see the arch in the view on the right. And Valadier did something very interesting, and archaeologically very forward thinking, in that since the center of the arch was made out of Greek marble, pentelic marble–p-e-n-t-e-l-i-c–pentelic marble from Mount Pentelikon in Greece–which in itself is interesting because we saw that the Flavians were using imported marbles in their buildings; I’ve mentioned that already before. This view on the left, there are quite a number of preserved paintings and engravings that show the arch before the Valadier reconstruction, and you see one of those over there. We see it quite infrequently in Roman architecture, but we do see it on occasion. And you can see the famous seven-branched candelabrum that they are carrying here. And you’ll recall what they did with those spoils. So once again the Flavians always showing an affinity for, and an interest in, the people of the city – the people of the city that they were trying, of course, to court favor from. You can get good gelato almost anywhere in Rome, and in Italy, but the very best, this is one of those four; I’ll say something more about that in a moment. Just to show you also that again–just as when we were in Capri I showed you the Bar Tiberio, and its reference to Tiberius–it’s amazing what those who put up restaurants and bars and so on, around Rome, it’s amazing–it demonstrates the strong sense of history that Italians have. So this word, the Domus Augustana, referred both to the private wing, as opposed to the Domus Flavia, but also to the palace as a whole. But we can simplify it completely and just call it the Palace of Domitian on the Palatine Hill, which is what I suggest we do. And it includes, as you can see in the upper left corner, a basilica: a basilica, a room with a central space, divided by two side aisles by columns. And here you get a sense of that space in which Domitian would have sat: the apse of the room, the curvature of the wall, made, of course, out of concrete–as this entire structure was–made out of concrete, with a semi-dome. And then picture windows, through which you would see these very interesting elliptical fountains, as you dined, one on either side of the structure. The private wing of the palace, equally spectacular in its own way. And part of it is on two stories, the part that you see over here. The sunken stadium is actually quite well preserved. As you can see here, it’s one of the better preserved parts of the villa today. Once again, Rabirius has had a great deal of fun with his fountain. You see here again he’s playing off convex against concave. Around the court, the fountain court, and the private wing that we’ve just looked at, there were a series of rooms, and if you look at some of those rooms in detail, I think you’ll be amazed by what you see; some fantastically shaped rooms: some of them cruciform, cross-shaped; some of them going way back to the  with circular rooms with radiating alcoves. And this is again very experimental, very different; it really is different than almost anything I can show you, not only before but even after this great work of architecture, and it gives us some insight into the creativity of Rabirius, and the way in which Domitian was allowing him to be. You’ll remember the location of the Roman Forum here, and obviously down below: the Forum of Julius Caesar that we’ve already studied; the Forum of Augustus built right next to that, that we’ve also looked at in detail; and then the Forum Pacis, or the Templum Pacis of Vespasian, which we have looked at more recently, and which you’ll recall was built in such a way so that it faced the Forum of Augustus and the Forum of Julius Caesar next door. But it was an area that was being eyed by Domitian. He dreamed those big dreams but he was never able to realize them. Because this forum was like a street and was so narrow, that had an effect on what could be built there; so that you can see, for example, in plan, that while the Forums of Julius Caesar and Augustus, and the Forum Pacis, all had colonnades, covered colonnades in fact, there was no space to build a covered colonnade here. We have not seen this before in built architecture. So it’s something again that we think may have been done in temporary wooden architecture, for example. And this also an interesting engraving by the famous artist Piranesi, a Piranesi print of the eighteenth century."
667,history-art,hsar-252,lecture-14,"Professor Kleiner analyzes the major public architectural commissions of the emperor Trajan in Rome. Distinguished by their remarkably ambitious scale, these buildings mimic Trajan’s expansion of the Roman Empire to its furthest reaches. Professor Kleiner begins with Trajan’s restoration of the Forum of Julius Caesar and proceeds to the Baths of Trajan. Situated on the Oppian and Esquiline Hills, these Trajanic baths follow the basic model of the earlier imperial Baths of Titus but increase the size of the complex several times. Most of the lecture focuses on the famous Forum and Markets of Trajan, built on land that the engineer and architect Apollodorus of Damascus created by cutting away part of the Quirinal Hill. The Forum of Trajan consists of a large open rectangular area, a basilica, Greek and Latin libraries, and a temple dedicated to Trajan after his death. Between the libraries stands the celebrated Column of Trajan with a spiral frieze commemorating the emperor’s military victories in Dacia (modern Romania) and reaching a height of 125 feet. The brick-faced concrete Markets of Trajan climb up the hill and form a dramatic contrast to the marble forum. The lecture concludes with a brief discussion of the Arch of Trajan at Benevento, which depicts scenes of the emperor’s greatest accomplishments and the first representations of his successor, Hadrian.","Today’s lecture I have called, as you can see, “The Mother of All Forums: Civic Architecture in Rome Under Trajan.” And he was also extremely wise when it came to his choice of the kinds of buildings that he wanted to put up, because he followed in the footsteps of Vespasian and Titus, by favoring major public architecture in Rome, and by eschewing private architecture. And if you look at the Temple of Venus Genetrix, you see that all that survives, besides the podium and the staircase, are three columns from that restored version, by Trajan. So he does continue this Flavian interest in very elaborate architectural decoration. And there is other Venus imagery, and I show you a detail–and it’s on your Monument List–I show you a detail of part of a frieze that depicts cupids–chubby, winged babies, as you can see here, cupids–who are carrying the arms–you can see one of them with a sword sheath over here–they are carrying the arms and armor of Mars: Mars, of course, the consort of Venus, and Mars making reference also to military victory. This frieze, as far as we can tell, does belong to the Trajanic renovation of the building, but it probably does look back to an earlier Julian frieze that decorated the original temple in Rome. Now these Baths of Trajan are very interesting in all kinds of ways. The Baths of Titus were not small, and yet the Baths of Trajan are at least three, if not four or more, times the size of the Baths of Titus. But we’re not absolutely sure about its plan, that is, the Neronian Baths. And then all the other rooms of the bath were displayed around those, in a symmetrical way. And then you can see that is surrounded by columns. What we’re looking at here is a spectacular aerial view of the part of Rome in which the Forum of Trajan finds itself. And at the very least, right now, without narrowing the street, the main Via dei Fori Imperiali, they are doing excavation in that park area. Colonnades, also on either side, and some additional columns here. And we’re going to see that just as in Augustus’ forum–another reference back to Augustus–that the columns in this main area are Corinthian below, but in the second tier there are figures – not figures of caryatids, but different kinds of figures, and I’m going to show you those soon. The one on the left gives you a better sense of what these looked like in antiquity. And once again, how fortunate we are that we have coins that say BASILICAVLPIA, Basilica Ulpia. And you can see that same, roughly that same scheme here. We’ve talked about the clerestory before. But you can get a sense of it, with the reading tables, with the scrolls inside these cabinets here, with the statuary, and in this case he believes that it had a vaulted roof, as you can see on top. They start to build walls with headers and stretchers. They start to build forts and city walls, in which they put buildings with Roman amenities. It’s very interesting to see them depicting, the Romans depicting, the Dacians in such a heroic way on this column. In antiquity they would have been harder to read. And what’s interesting about this, if you look, if you Google this and look at the website for the Fireman’s Memorial in New York, you will find out that the designer for this talks unabashedly of his admiration for the Column of Trajan in Rome, and that he used, as an artistic model, for the way in which he massed figures here, showing them in relationship to buildings, he used, as his model, the figures on the Column of Trajan, in Rome. So a victory, not only one of his great victories, military victories, but also victory over death. So it’s a very theatrical representation, in the sense that you would be standing here with Trajan, during life, looking back toward that column, looking back at the divinization of Trajan, a bronze statue, which would have seemed as if it was floating on top of the Basilica Ulpia. While the forum was the Romans imposing a rectangular plan on nature–remember, they have to cut back the hill, to make way for it–the markets are something quite different. Here is a view of the great hemicycle, down on the first story. We have not seen that, up to this point chronologically, in built architecture. You can see how skilled they are in using ramps, with polygonal masonry, as well as sidewalks and stairs, so that you can make your way up with either alternative here. I described this, I think, in the introductory lecture as in a sense opening up a series of umbrellas over the space. The major difference, of course, between the two, that this has sculpture only on the inside, and sparingly in the center and around the frieze, and this has much more sculpture, again telling us in much greater detail a list–or describing a list of the great accomplishments of Trajan. So some hanky-panky was going on behind the scenes. And we’re going to see that Hadrian keeps that tradition alive, not only in the Pantheon, but also in his Villa of Tivoli."
668,history-art,hsar-252,lecture-17,"Professor Kleiner discusses the increasing size of Roman architecture in the second and third centuries A.D. as an example of a “bigger is better” philosophy. She begins with an overview of tomb architecture, a genre that, in Rome as in Ostia, embraced the aesthetic of exposed brick as a facing for the exteriors of buildings. Interiors of second-century tombs, Professor Kleiner reveals, encompass two primary groups – those that are decorated with painted stucco and those embellished primarily with architectural elements. After a discussion of the Temple of the Divine Antoninus Pius and Faustina and its post-antique afterlife as the Church of S. Lorenzo in Miranda, Professor Kleiner introduces the Severan dynasty as it ushers in the third century. She focuses first on the Arch of Septimius Severus in the Roman Forum, the earliest surviving triple-bayed arch in Rome. She next presents the so-called Septizodium, a lively baroque-style façade for Domitian’s Palace on the Palatine Hill. The lecture concludes with the colossal Baths of Caracalla, which awed the public by their size and by a decorative program that assimilated the emperor Caracalla to the hero Hercules.","From the time of Julius Caesar, we have seen the rulers of Rome brag about building buildings that were bigger than any others in the world. They had barrel vaults or groin vaults inside. It was put up on the famous via Appia, or the Appian Way. I’m sure you would have said it was a temple; and you would’ve been right in the sense that it looks most like a temple. This is a view of the tomb as it looks today. Concrete construction, faced with brick, the brick left exposed, respected and enjoyed, in its own right. I show you once again a detail of the warehouse or the Horrea Epagathiana at Ostia that we looked at, and also a detail of the Tomb of Annia Regilla in Rome. And I think you can see here what I mean. Two more details of the Tomb of Annia Regilla. Here you see what I was talking about before, the way the architect has scooped out two areas on the left side of the tomb, and placed the columns inside of those, which is a unique–I don’t know of any other example of this in Roman architecture, and it underscores, once again, that when it came to tomb architecture, that the patron could pretty much do whatever he wanted, as long as the architect could build it. But they do seem to have that same pedigree, going back to the whole idea of the caryatids. We see that the tomb is a thoroughly Roman tomb of the second century A.D. But it would be interesting to think that he might have added some touches that might have made some reference for him, and also especially for his wife whose tomb it was, to the Athens of his birth. And I’m sure you are as reminded as I am, looking at this vault, by other things that we have seen earlier this semester. Because although you continue to see floating mythological figures in these rectangular or triangular compartments, if you look very closely, especially in this zone here, you will also see these architectural cages, done in stucco, very similar to the architectural cages that we saw at the top of Fourth Style Roman wall design. So this taking its cue from Fourth Style Roman wall painting. And I have mentioned to you a couple of times already this term that, in fact, most post-Pompeian painting, and stucco decoration, post-79 A.D., does seem to be inspired by the third style, but even more so by the fourth style of Roman wall painting, and we see that very well here, with this stucco decorating the lunettes and also the vaulting. If you want to talk about bigger is better, or biggest is best, this is a truly colossal building, as any of you who have been there know. It is very much like walking along the tomb street in Isola Sacra. And I show you just the most famous mosaic that is located down there, which you see is a figure in a chariot. The same travertine door jambs, inscriptions, slit windows. This is an axonometric view from Ward-Perkins of the Tomb of the Caetennii. Hadrian had died in 138 A.D., and he was succeeded by a man by the name of Antoninus Pius, whose portrait you see here on the upper right. It is a fiction of which the Romans were particularly adept in their sculptural representations. But I show it to you here because it has some bearing on a temple that I now want to talk about. This is the so-called Temple of Antoninus Pius and Faustina the Elder. Over here we see a series of drawings, that come from the Ward-Perkins textbook, that show once again a depiction of that original temple on the coin, and with a legend that says , for eternity, because now she is a diva for eternity. But what you see behind it is the Baroque façade rising up, a Baroque façade that has buttresses–and I’m going to show it to you in actuality in a moment–that has buttresses on either side, that has this wonderful split, arcuated pediment–a split, arcuated pediment that would’ve been impossible to conceive, I believe, without these architects, Baroque architects of seventeenth century, looking back to the baroque element in Roman antiquity. So prime real estate for this temple, when Antoninus Pius decides to build it to his wife. You see Lucius Verus on the left-hand side. It was found–excuse me, not in Rome but in Egypt, and is now in a museum in Berlin. But there were obviously many of these in antiquity. I want to show you first though two buildings; before we look at the Baths of Caracalla, I do want to show you two buildings of Septimius Severus: a public building first, the so-called Arch of Septimius Severus in the Roman Forum, and then an extension to the Palatine Palace. You’ll have to imagine the great bronze quadriga of the emperor at the apex. He lived there, just like every emperor since Domitian. Baths of Caracalla: dates to 212 to 216 A.D. Any of you who have seen it will agree with me this is one–if we had, if Trajan’s Forum was the mother of all forums, this is certainly the mother of all imperial bath structures."
669,history-art,hsar-252,lecture-18,"Professor Kleiner discusses two Roman cities in North Africa: Timgad and Leptis Magna. Timgad was created as an entirely new colony for Roman army veterans by Trajan in A.D. 100, and designed all at once as an ideal  plan. Leptis Magna, conversely, grew more gradually from its Carthaginian roots, experiencing significant Roman development under Augustus and Hadrian. Septimius Severus, the first Roman emperor from North Africa, was born at Leptis and his hometown was renovated in connection with his historic visit to the city. This large-scale program of architectural expansion features the Severan Forum and Basilica and the nearby Arch of Septimius Severus, a or four-sided arch located at the crossing of two major streets. The lecture culminates with the unique Hunting Baths, a late second or early third-century structure built for a group of entrepreneurs who supplied exotic animals to Rome’s amphitheaters. Its intimate vaulted spaces are revealed on the outside of the building and silhouetted picturesquely against the sea, suggesting that the bath’s owners knew how to innovate through concrete architecture and how to enjoy life.","The title of today’s lecture is “Hometown Boy, Honoring an Emperor’s Roots in Roman North Africa.” So it’s absolutely critical for us to understand the area that we’re looking at, and in this case Roman North Africa. And the cities that we’re going to be talking about–there were lots of Roman cities in this part of the world, but the two that we’re going to be focusing on today are the city of Timgad, which you see over here, and then the city of Leptis Magna. So you see this colonnaded, this very dramatic colonnaded street. And I can show you a detail of one of the colonnaded streets of the city of Timgad, as it looks today, and you can see the effect that putting those columns, the punctuation points of those columns, along the way, which actually adds to–makes the vista that one sees from one part of the street to another very, very interesting indeed; as those columns, in a sense, march toward the arch that you see at the end here. So I raised the point with you that while we usually think of ideas flowing from the center to the periphery, this may be an instance where certain ideas are developed first in the provinces, and then make their way to Rome. I talked about the sand, and there’s a lot of sand in this part of the world–this is essentially desert–and we see it especially around the city of Leptis Magna. If Timgad is in modern Algeria, Leptis Magna is in modern Libya, Colonel Gaddafi country. Sorry to put you on the spot, but having taken Roman–it’s Augustus. This is a plan of Leptis Magna as it would have looked in the ancient period. And then down here, to the left of the Hadrianic Baths, there was an arch put up on one of the streets; an arch put up also to Septimius Severus, which we will look at together today. Because there is an inscription on the building that interestingly enough is written in both Latin and then has a neo-Punic translation. But if we look at these pavilions carefully, we see some interesting features. We can also see the columns that surround it; and you can tell very well that these are Ionic columns. And this is where we see a significant difference with the planning of Timgad. In fact, it might remind you, more than a hippodrome, of the Basilica Ulpia in the Forum of Trajan, with its two curved ends, one on either side, and columns running around the center, and then two radiating apses, up here on the right–on the uppermost part, excuse me. The  here with its radiating niches, as you can see. So this is a very significant change in the way they are thinking about the building materials used for the structures of Leptis. But we see three of them here, and they’re very instructive. Well Liber Pater was a god who was very important to this particular part of the world. And that is if you look at the actual remains of the columnar architecture, for example, from this forum, you will see, very quickly, that we are dealing not with local limestone but with imported marble. Well maybe it would’ve looked something like this, at least in plan, but almost certainly not in building materials. It is not axially related exactly to the forum proper. So when you’re standing there, you do get the sense, and as you move from the forum, into this apsed area here, through columns, into the columns of the basilica–which you can do–you don’t realize that the basilica is really off axis with the rest of the building. And you can see, even in black and white, that we’re dealing with local sandstone or limestone for the walls, but with imported marble for the doorways and for the pilasters. This is a view of the shops, of that wedge-shaped section of shops. It is a temple that was put up by Caracalla. The plan, once again, that shows us the basilica, central nave, side aisles, apses on either side, looking very much like the Basilica Ulpia of Trajan in Rome, probably influenced by that. And then a very unusual motif, architectural motif, in the center. And two more details of that decoration here. But I just want to make passing reference to it, because it is the one building that I mentioned that we do believe was put up in 203, and ready for Septimius’ visit to the city. It also is interesting because it was made at the same time as the arch in Rome, the Parthian Arch in Rome, 203 A.D., and also celebrates Septimius Severus’ victories over the Parthians. But we do see here something very interesting, and that is that they have used the broken triangular pediment here. This bath is interesting in all kinds of ways, but it’s interesting primarily because it’s a private bath, not a public bath; we’ve looked at so many public baths this semester. And what’s interesting about it is although we have seen that concrete was not used extensively in Leptis Magna, it is used for this building, and this building is much more innovative for that reason than most of the other structures we’ve seen, even those that honor Septimius Severus, like the arch, like the forum, and like the basilica."
670,history-art,hsar-252,lecture-19,"Professor Kleiner features the baroque phenomenon in Roman architecture, in which the traditional vocabulary of architecture, consisting of columns and other conventional architectural elements, is manipulated to enliven building façades and inject them with dynamic motion. This baroque trend is often conspicuously ornamental and began to be deployed on the walls of forums and tombs in Italy already in the late first century A.D. But baroque architecture in Roman antiquity was foremost in the Greek East where high-quality marble and expert marble carvers made it the architectural mode of choice. At Petra in Jordan, tomb chambers were cut into cliffs and elaborate façades carved out of the living rock. The cities of Miletus and Ephesus in Asia Minor were adorned with gates and fountains and libraries and stage buildings that consisted of multi-storied columnar screens. The lecture culminates with the Sanctuary of Jupiter Heliopolitanus, a massive temple complex at Baalbek in Lebanon, with Temples of Jupiter and Bacchus in enormous scale and with extreme embellishment, and the Temple of Venus with an undulating lintel that foreshadows the curvilinear flourishes of Francesco Borromini’s S. Carlo alle Quattro Fontane in seventeenth-century Rome.","Today I am going to–well actually let me step back for a second. And by that I mean the traditional vocabulary of Greek and Etruscan architecture, for the most part. Think back to Second Style Roman wall painting. I remind you of the Room of the Masks in the House of Augustus, where you see this theatrical façade, done in paint, that represents columns with projecting elements or lintels on either side, and then a kind of a pediment up above. And this is when we really begin to see, in built architecture, this move toward what we’re defining today as the baroque in Roman architecture. And I’d like to concentrate on those today; although we’ll look–we won’t look at those exclusively. It is close to all the sites in Campania that we’ve been talking about this semester. But you can also see that some brick has been used, around the niches, and as a molding, both for these cylinders and for the  above. But we have to think of it as very prescient of what is to come, experimenting, as did some of those other buildings that I just showed you–the Forum Transitorium, for example–with the sort of thing that is going to become particularly popular in the second and third centuries A.D.Now I juxtapose this tomb–and by the way, this tomb, the nickname of this tomb, as you can see from your Monument List, is “La Conocchia.” So that’s how it got its nickname, La Conocchia. But you can see by the juxtaposition of it with the Tomb of the Baker on the right, and with the Monument of the Julii in Saint Rémy, in the south of France–which we haven’t looked at, but which we will look at in a lecture next week on Roman architecture in the south of France, primarily–you will see that it makes reference to both of these. But it’s interesting to see the differences between the two, because what we see in this monument again is much more what we would call baroque, in the sense that we have the undulating façade, we have the use of what looked like, in a general way, the traditional vocabulary of architecture, with these cylinders, with the niches, with the pediments. I’m showing you a map of the Eastern Roman Empire, and we see the site in question, Petra, or some say Petra: you can call it either one, Petra or Petra. And if you look at this tomb, the Deir, you should also be struck immediately by the way in which what the Romans have created here is a version in built architecture of what we saw already in 60 to 50 B.C. in Second Style Roman wall painting. But you don’t have a sense that there is any space in there. But you also see here a capital that is unlike any capital that we have seen before. We don’t see anything like this in Greek or Roman architecture; the metopes, in fact, in Greek architecture are usually filled with figural scenes, figural panels. And that’s not so different from what we saw Rabirius, for example, doing in his octagonal room and in the fountain at the Palace on the Palatine Hill. You can see down below a real temple front, in this case. And I want to begin in Ephesus, to show you one building there of considerable interest I think, in terms of its relationships to Rome. And also just to make the point that this same use of the straight and arcuated lintel, that we see in Hadrianic architecture, turns up also in seventeenth-century Baroque Rome. It now can be seen in the museum in Berlin. There were fragments strewn everywhere: hundreds and hundreds of fragments strewn around the site, and enough fragments so that basically the building was there. The bottom tier is very similar to what we saw there, just two columns supporting a straight entablature above. And you can see that the scheme is the same. We see the Three Graces here, for example. And the remains are incredible, the remains are incredible. Again, it was built over a series of years. A very large altar right here, to Jupiter, because the main temple in this complex was the Temple to Jupiter, and you see it also in the restored view at the back. If you look at the Temple to Jupiter, you will see it’s very similar to the temples that we’ve been looking at over the course of the semester: very tall podium, single staircase, façade orientation, deep porch, freestanding columns in that porch, and the like. You can see the hexagonal court from above. And here an engraving showing the entranceway, with this arcuated lintel, just as we saw popular in the Hadrianic period, and the pediment. You can get a very good sense of its structure, and you can see the way in which it combines typical Roman with Greek features: single staircase, façade orientation, deep porch, freestanding columns in the porch, single cella. This is a big building, and this building is much smaller than the Temple of Jupiter. It is a round structure with a round cella."
671,history-art,hsar-252,lecture-2,"Professor Kleiner traces the evolution of Roman architecture from its beginnings in the eight-century B.C. Iron Age through the late Republican period. The lecture features traditional Roman temple architecture as a synthesis of Etruscan and Greek temple types, early defensive wall building in Rome and environs, and a range of technologies and building practices that made this architecture possible. City planning in such early Roman colonies as Cosa and Ostia is also discussed, as are examples of the first uses of the arch and of concrete construction, two elements that came to dominate Roman architectural practice. The lecture ends with an analysis of typical late Republican temples at Rome, Cori, and Tivoli.","Last time I introduced you to some of Rome’s greatest buildings, and I remind you of two of them here: the Pantheon, on the left-hand side of the screen, the temple to all the gods, and then, of course, the Colosseum, on the right-hand side of the screen. Romulus founded the city of Rome on one of Rome’s seven hills, the Palatine Hill. So I show you one of these views of the Palatine Hill in Rome, from Google Earth, and you can see the relationship of that hill to the part of Rome in which it finds itself. You can see the Roman Forum lying in front of it. It has rounded corners, as you can see here, and the roof of the hut urn is sloping. So we do believe we use this, along with the surviving pavement, to restore what these huts of Romulus looked like in the eighth century B.C.Let me also note–it’s interesting just to see the status of men and women in any given civilization at any given time. And of course it was from this village that the great city of Rome grew, and of course there’s a quite significant difference between Rome as it is now and Rome as it was in the eighth century B.C.I’m going to skip a couple of centuries and take us from the eighth century B.C. to the sixth century B.C., and talk about what was the greatest architectural project in the sixth century B.C. Just a few words about what was going on in the sixth century B.C. Those who were ascendant in the sixth century B.C. were essentially the Etruscans. Believe it or not, we have quite a bit of evidence. But I think you’ll find those handouts extremely helpful. The rectangular structure has a deep porch, and these circles are columns – so with freestanding columns in that porch. Mud-brick, not wattle and daub, but mud-brick for the podium and for the walls, and then the structure had quite a bit of decoration – you don’t see it here, but quite a bit of decoration, sculptural decoration, in ancient times, and this was made out of terracotta. We’ve looked at the Campidoglio; we see Michelangelo’s buildings are up there now. And again a characteristic of Etruscan temple architecture, and as we shall see of most Roman temple architecture, is to have a very high podium. And we see a great efflorescence of wall building therefore after the sack of 386 B.C.And I want to turn to that wall construction right now. And fortunately some parts of that wall are still preserved today. And we see the same use of polygonal masonry at the town of Cosa, which is north of Norba, as you’ll remember from the custom map, the town of Cosa. And I think you can see once again a grayish stone used for these walls, and you can see that the construction is once again polygonal masonry. And I mentioned to you last time that this is very different from what happened in Rome. If there were a lot of hills and so on, it might end up with a somewhat more irregular shape. But I’m going to begin with the one in Rome, which takes me back to Google Earth here, to show you the situation of the so-called Temple of Portunus in Rome, that dates to, we believe, sometime–it was put up sometime between 120 and 80 B.C. in Rome. So you can see, in conjunction to another temple, it was built very close to the river, to the Tiber River. So take us a little further with the columns. Neil was right, however, that this is a combination in that there are columns that go around the monument. From a distance it does indeed look peripteral. But as you look closely you will see that the columns are indeed attached to the wall, on the side, and around the other side. This is a temple that is made out of stone. You can’t see it here, but you can up there. It has a side as well as a front – or sides as well as fronts. So once again an Etruscan plan with some nod to Greece, in the sense that there’s a recognition – we’ve got to have something that goes around here. The Corinthian order; the Corinthian, the last of the three great Greek orders. The Corinthian order, which is very ornate and which I’ll describe in a moment. We see it here, supporting a frieze once again, in this case a frieze with garlands and libation dishes. What’s characteristic of Corinthian capitals is that they have, like the Ionic, they have volutes, these spiral volutes, but they are much smaller and much more delicate, and they are in a sense incorporated into the flowering plant. I think it has to do probably with two major reasons. The Ionic looks best from certain angles where you can really see the volutes well, less well from other angles. The Sibilla used to be a horrendous restaurant. But I think these new Greek style temples were definitely here to stay. And I just wanted to end up with a quote from Cicero."
672,history-art,hsar-252,lecture-3,"Professor Kleiner discusses the revolution in Roman architecture resulting from the widespread adoption of concrete in the late second and first centuries B.C. She contrasts what she calls innovative Roman architecture with the more traditional buildings already surveyed and documents a shift from the use of concrete for practical purposes to an exploration of its expressive possibilities. The lecture concludes with a discussion of the Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia at Palestrina, an impressive terraced complex that uses concrete to transform a mountain into a work of architecture, with ramps and stairs leading from one level to the next and porticoes revealing panoramic views of nature and of man-made architectural forms.","It’s Inauguration Day–Happy Inauguration Day to everyone–and I thought that actually the inauguration of Barack Obama today and the particular lecture in this class are very well suited to one another. Because the change the Romans believed in, the change the Romans believed in was a shift from what we call traditional Roman architecture to innovative Roman architecture. It’s a composite of various natural elements that becomes a liquid mass when mixed with water and eventually hardens into a very, very strong substance, much stronger than any of its ingredients are on their own. This is a very momentous change and one that will have a lasting impact on the buildings of the Romans. They’ve cut and quarried the stones as usual. And actually that was pretty successful, because here it is, still today, looking pretty good in that regard. But with the introduction of concrete into architecture, under the Romans, building a dome like the Pantheon was simplicity itself. I remind you of the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli, which you see here, and you will recall that the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli had concrete, both in its podium, for utilitarian purposes and to support the great weight of the temple, but also that the architects explored making the cella wall, the curved cella wall, also out of concrete. And so a stone facing, , that was particularly favored in the second century B.C. and into the first century B.C. Over time the choice of facing changed. I want to show you today a series of these concrete constructions, concrete experiments we might call them, that begin to turn up, not only in Rome itself, but also in some of the cities close to Rome, that we saw Rome began to colonize in the Republic and into the age of Augustus – cities that either are the same or very close to the ones that we looked at last time, and I’ll show you a map momentarily. The Porticus Aemilia was a warehouse, a very large warehouse on the banks of the Tiber River. The Marble Map of Rome, called the –and I’ve put that word on the Monument List, that title on the Monument List for you, the –the  was a great marble map that was made of Rome in the early third century A.D., under the emperorship of Septimius Severus, and put up on a wall in Rome, and we’ll talk about its location later on in the semester. So we have to do the best that we can to bring that evidence together to determine what it looked like. You can walk not only along each barrel vault, but you can walk in between the piers which, as I said, creates a sense of much more openness, and lateral as well as axial movement. It’s very unusual for them to skew something like this. These are regular stones, all bunched together to create an attractive appearance, although this was probably stuccoed in antiquity. A view once again of the restored view of the sanctuary. And it’s interesting because here too we see the architects using concrete construction, creating a barrel vaulted corridor, in this case with windows on the end and then a few doorways and some slit windows, all of them arched, as you can see here, to allow light into the structure. This is another restored view, showing you the same. We are looking at part–let me go back for a second just to point this out. First of all, let me point out that it is made out of concrete. But here in Rome they decided not to use– work was not the rage in Rome. So you’re having a varied experience, but you’re kind of having it in the way that the Romans want you to have it, and that’s an interesting phenomenon that I hope we’ll think about together as we converse in the online forum. Here you can see these wedge-shaped sections of seats called the , that both Greek theaters and also Roman theaters had. You see Michelangelo’s oval piazza up there. The culminating monument of that town is still the Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia. And that’s exactly what’s happening here. Another view of that, both the wall and the annular vault, decorated with  work; a detail of that  work to show you how very attractive it was. The stairways are pretty–are short, so that it’s a very arduous trip up, as I said. And then you can get a sense of the fact that you would’ve seen the Sanctuary of Fortuna at the top; now you see the embracing arms of the Barberini Palace, but you can see those arms follow the exact shape of the original hemicycle that was once there. And you can also see the theater staircase very well preserved; and I show you a detail of that theater staircase, leading into the doorway into the museum today."
673,history-art,hsar-252,lecture-4,"Professor Kleiner explores the civic, commercial, and religious buildings of Pompeii, an overview made possible only because of an historical happenstance–the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79, which buried the city at the height of its development. While the lecture features the resort town’s public architecture–its forum, basilica, temples, amphitheater, theater, and bath complexes–Professor Kleiner also describes such fixtures of daily life as a bakery and a fast food restaurant. The lecture culminates with a brief overview of tomb architecture in Pompeii and a moving account of what happened to the inhabitants of the city of Pompeii when disaster struck.","Last time we talked about a number of monuments that were connected to one another geographically and also chronologically, and were also made out of the same material: concrete faced with . You can see that this area of Campania is obviously south of Rome. It was a town that obviously had its own population of people who made their money largely from commerce, because they were located so close to the sea. But it was also a spot that was highly favored by the glitterati of Rome, who used to come down to this area of Rome, not only to go to Pompeii itself, but to establish villas, to build villas in the vicinity of Pompeii. The history of Pompeii, as I noted, is much longer than the history of Roman Pompeii. Their property was confiscated, and that property was given instead to the Roman veterans. And we have, from this point on, from 62 on, almost immediately seventeen years of frenzied building activity in which the Pompeians tried to bring their city back from the dead, so to speak, to bring it back to what it had once been. Now this tragedy that befell Pompeii, in August of 79, was indeed a tragedy for them, for the people who lived there obviously. Because, again, everything–nothing is changed from the time that it was left there, except for what the treasure hunters removed. We see all of the buildings at that juncture. And in that Samnite city, the Romans–and they followed Roman surveying methodology here–they looked to what was exactly the center of the city and they placed the , the north-south street, and the , the east-west street, at that exact mid-point of the city. We see that the central part of the Forum, which was again essentially the main meeting and marketplace of the forum, is a very elongated rectangle, with a temple, a Capitolium, a Temple to Jupiter, located on one of the short ends. And you can see everything here that I’ve already pointed out: the open rectangular space, the colonnade, the temple pushed up against the back wall – the Temple of Jupiter, the Basilica over here, the Temple of Apollo, Eumachia’s building here, the Senate House over here, and so on. The view that you see of the Basilica as it looks today is also very illuminating. One of them is restored, at the top right, but that one is a Corinthian capital. And you can also see here some of the lower parts of the columns that would have been encircling the center of the structure and dividing the central space from two aisles, one on either side. These things were often pieced, and so sometimes that can happen. So you can see how large in scale these were in ancient Roman times. And you can see here the tribunal; we’re looking toward the tribunal. So that was one of the first orders of business. I guarantee you, you will remember this name for the rest of your lives. What’s interesting here, and one of the reasons I also bring back the Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia, is the fact that the Romans again are giving you some options in terms of how you get into this building. They give you a few options, but within that scheme it is clearly a pre-determined path, up the staircase over here, and then through only those two barrel-vaulted corridors. We’ll look at it in more detail later in the semester, but I wanted to just show it to you now, because it is so apparent that it is a representation of the Amphitheater at Pompeii, which is not surprising, since this is a house in Pompeii. But you can also see–this is a very important detail that is, and this is the only place where we actually have a representation of it–you can see that at the upper most part of the , there is an awning, called a –and I’ve put that word on the Monument List for you–an awning that was supported by poles, that were located on brackets at the uppermost part of the amphitheater. This very important room, the  of the Stabian Baths, you see it here as it looks today: a small, round space. We see the  or undressing and dressing room over here at 3. You can also see they’ve used a great barrel vault for this room. The –excellent–the  over here, with its rectangular shape and then its apse and its basin for cold water splashes. I show you actually a scene of one of the storage rooms at Pompeii that you can see actually as you walk along–it’s a wonderful ruffling, turning to the next page–these wine, these amphoras, these great clay amphoras that held wine. You’ll also see these big blocks of stone. And this is what you see as you wander the streets. The Pompeians saw what was happening, and those who were smart did escape. They were gravely mistaken, gravely mistaken. We think it was actually a fairly small number; some have said about a thousand."
674,history-art,hsar-252,lecture-5,"Professor Kleiner discusses domestic architecture at Pompeii from its beginnings in the fourth and third centuries B.C. to the eruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 79. She describes the plan of the ideal  and features two residences that conform to that layout. She then presents the so-called Hellenized  that incorporates elements of Greek domestic architecture, especially the peristyle court with columns. The primary example is the famous House of the Faun with its tetrastyle atrium, double peristyles, and floor mosaic of the battle between Alexander the Great and Darius of Persia at Issus, a Roman copy of an original Greek painting. She concludes by highlighting the suburban Villa of the Mysteries and notes the distinction between plans of Roman houses and those of Roman villas.","As you can see, the title of today’s lecture is “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous: Houses and Villas at Pompeii.” So considered a very public part of the house, a place where you wanted it to look its best because you were going to be greeting important visitors there, to do business. And you can see that each one of them opens up off the atrium. Many of them didn’t have any windows, they were literally just sleeping spaces. This room is called the , t-a-b-l-i-n-u-m, the , which started as the master bedroom of the house, the most important bedroom, much larger than the , but over time it became a place where the family archives were kept. But, other than that, there are no windows whatsoever. They’ve even provided–it’s all done in stone, the tufa stone – but you see they’ve even provided stone pillows here, not very comfortable, but it gives you the sense of what a house would’ve been like. And then if you look very carefully, also indicated in stone, the rafters, the beams done in stone. So those are the ones that you should study and remember. So now I want to show you some examples of houses that conform to the Hellenized  type, this being the first one. You look through that and you see the garden. The garden has its columns surrounding it. And what also becomes very clear in looking at this particular view is something that we’ve already discussed, and that is the importance in the minds of the Romans of vista or panorama, of great views that you can see from one part of a building to another. It would’ve been, of course, even more beautiful in antiquity, when it would’ve been in better shape. But nonetheless, this gives you–it’s a bit overgrown now and so on–but it gives you some sense of what it would’ve looked like, with the greenery in the garden, surrounded by the columns, with garden furniture, little fountains, little marble fountains and the like, and with the walls–the paintings are not in very good shape today, but imagine them more vibrant. You will see the kitchen marked on that plan. There are cells on either side, opening off the . Because look what’s happened to the atrium. So some interesting correspondences there in terms of building practice. This is actually a wooden vault, rather than a concrete vault here in this room. You can see from this plan that it takes up in fact the entire block, an entire block of the city of Pompeii, and it is much larger than some of the others. Clearly no expense was spared, either in accumulating the property, and also in enhancing the décor of the house. It opens right off the peristyle court, and on the floor of that space, which we call the Alexander exedra, e-x-e-d-r-a, after Alexander the Great, because on the floor of that was the most famous mosaic that we have surviving from antiquity, that represents Alexander the Great, and I’ll show you that momentarily. You see the sidewalks here as well, and how modern they look. You go into the house and stand in the vestibule. In that  is a statuette in bronze of the Dancing Faun, from which this house gets its name. This is very helpful because it shows us exactly what the  that opened off the atrium would’ve looked like. And then the view toward the peristyle, where you would also see the columns that looked like they were very much in the Greek style. And, of course, you can see that they display it there as if it were a panel picture, hanging on the wall. They had to look at Greek art and derive from it. Here’s the other detail that I’m going to show you of Darius, in his chariot. And it’s really an extraordinary work of art. This is interesting because you can see again the  opening off either side, but also because of the incorporation, just as in the House of the Faun, of columns elsewhere than just in the peristyle. The second to last building that I want to show you is an extremely important one; the last one we’ll just look at for a minute or so. So it shows again the growing interest in peristyles. I’ll show you what it looks like in a moment. The most important point though that I can make about this villa, and something that speaks to the future, is the fact that we are beginning to see–we’ve talked about how enclosed and plain and severe the earlier exteriors of Roman houses were, even up through the Hellenized , except perhaps for the addition of a pilaster or a column here and there. This is a view of it as it looks today: the Villa of the Mysteries."
675,history-art,hsar-252,lecture-6,"Professor Kleiner discusses domestic architecture at Herculaneum and the First and Second Styles of Roman wall painting. The lecture begins with an introduction to the history of the city of Herculaneum and what befell some of its inhabitants when they tried to escape obliteration by Vesuvius. She features three houses in Herculaneum, two of which–the Houses of the Mosaic Atrium and the Stags–are among the best examples of a residential style popular in Campania between A.D. 62 and 79. Professor Kleiner then turns to the First or Masonry Style of Roman wall painting, which seeks to replicate the built architecture of Hellenistic kings and other elite patrons by using stucco and paint to imitate a real wall faced with marble. She follows with Second Style Roman wall painting, which uses only paint to open up the wall illusionistically onto vistas and prospects of sacred shrines, city scenes, and landscapes. The lecture concludes with a discussion of the Garden Room from the Villa of Livia at Primaporta, which epitomizes the Second Style by transforming the flat wall into a panoramic window.","As you can see from the title of today’s lecture, “Habitats at Herculaneum and Early Roman Interior Decoration,” we’re going to be concentrating once again, at least in the first half of the lecture, on domestic architecture in Campania. One, that although most of the city of Pompeii has been excavated, only about a quarter or twenty-five percent of the city of Herculaneum has been excavated. We don’t have a theater and a music hall complex. From that point on we know again comparable development. And this is the most famous example, and one that everybody sees as you wander the streets of Herculaneum, the Casa a Graticcio, which we see here – and you can see that even the balcony, which is made out of wood, is extremely well preserved. And those skeletons are in the same kinds of positions as the bodies that we saw at Pompeii, in that clearly a number of them have huddled together for protection, futile protection as it turned out. And again the bones are preserved, because of this circumstance of the particular configuration of the lava; the bones of that small child are also preserved in this crib in one of the houses in Herculaneum. I mentioned though that the evidence that we do have is mostly for residential architecture, and there are three houses in particular that I want to focus on, because they give us information that goes beyond the information that I’ve been able to give you from the houses that we looked at in Pompeii. Does it conform to the , or the Hellenized ? Notice also this sort of latticework fence that encircles it. We’ve talked about the fact that there was an increasing interest in the peristyle as a key component of a Roman house, and we see that very clearly here; in fact, the peristyle is really beginning to take pride of place away from the atrium. Here’s another view of this banqueting hall. You can also see this interesting use of combination of stone and tile, for the construction. Note also that the famous Pompeian red is used to decorate the walls. But that atrium is not like any other atrium we’ve seen thus far this semester. So this is a really good example of what I was hinting at before, and that is the atrium beginning to go the way of the ; the atrium beginning to become a passageway from one part of the house to another. What has received the greatest emphasis, by the patron and by the designer, is not the atrium, but is the  or dining hall, and you can see that there are two of them, and they are placed in relationship to one another, axial relationship to one another. You see the two  facing one another across the open court, and you see that little gazebo entranceway, a gazebo that again looks out toward the sea, that distinctive detail. And here you can see again so well the way this is positioned high up on the wall, with spectacular views of the sea, and this opening up of the wall to allow maximum vista, maximum panorama, through those spaces in the house. And we’ll see one of the most–well I’ll hold that until later, that thought until later. But again, most important for us, is what they’re trying to do is create an illusion. It was one of these crossroads of trade, and it was a place where Romans settled in the first centuries B.C. especially. We see the same zones–I won’t describe them again–but the same architectural zones that we see in the First Style paintings in Pompeii and in Herculaneum. The fact that it’s a Greek import is extremely important, because then we can group it with all the other Greek imports that we’ve been talking about: the columns, the peristyles, the Alexander mosaic; all of the things that the Romans, the Hellenizing elements that we have seen the Romans be particularly fond of in this early period and have used themselves in their architecture and in their architectural decor. But if you look at the paintings on the walls, and on the back wall, the side wall or the back wall–and I’ll show you a better view here–you will see that although we are dealing with something that looks like a First Style wall–it’s very flat, it’s divided into architectural zones: the socle, the orthostats, the isodomic courses here–that is all done entirely in paint, as you can see. When this was in better condition, a painting was made of it, and I show that painting to you here. And this dates a little bit later; it was done between 80 and 60 B.C. And we look at this; we will see that there are beginning to be some important changes here. You will see they hold lintels, but those lintels also are shown as if they’re receding into depth, and you can sort of barely see–and you’ll see this better as you study this in the online images. It is a scene in the Villa of the Mysteries. So we, in a sense, have three zones of space. You can see this black element that looks almost as if it were a curtain that’s been dropped down to reveal the scene that lies beyond. But the paintings are all genuine ancient paintings. What’s interesting about it is it’s broken at the bottom. And both of these houses were decorated with paintings. So this tripartite scheme of a Roman theater. The villa was put up in 30 to 25 B.C. A barrel-vaulted room was decorated with this gardenscape. Now as you look at this, you’d probably say to me: “That doesn’t look like anything we’ve looked at today. And here are a couple of details where you can see that very well, of this tree. You see what I mean by some leaves cast in shadows; some leaves have light shining on them."
676,history-art,hsar-252,lecture-7,"Professor Kleiner discusses the development of Third Style Roman wall painting in late first century B.C. villas belonging to the imperial family and other elite patrons. Third Style painting, as Professor Kleiner demonstrates, is characterized by departure from the perspectival vistas and panoramas of the Second Style toward an attenuation of architectural elements and a respect for the inherent flatness of the wall. The Third Style remains popular until the middle of the first century A.D., when it is replaced by the Fourth Style of Roman painting; both styles coexist in the Domus Aurea, the luxurious pleasure palace of the emperor Nero in downtown Rome. Professor Kleiner characterizes the Fourth Style of Roman wall painting as a compendium of previous styles, with imitation marble veneer, framed mythological panels, and the introduction of fragments of architecture situated in an illogical space.","As you can see from today’s lecture title, we’re going to be talking about painting palaces and villas in the first century A.D. But I could also call this lecture a lecture on Third and Fourth Style Roman wall painting, because we’re going to continue our conversation today about the four architectural styles of Roman wall painting. We also explored the fact that in the Second Style the Roman designers, the Roman painters, seemed to have experimented with one-point linear perspective, this perspective in which all points recede to a single point in the distance, and that we see that use of one-point perspective in the Second Style wall paintings in the Room of the Masks. So this connection to the theater, and the one last point that I want to remind you of is the fact that we also discussed that, although there’s an enormous respect for earlier Greek architecture, not only in these painting but in the temples and in the cities and in the sanctuaries that we’ve already explored, and we see the Roman painters using those elements of Greek architecture–columns and pediments and the like–in the Second Style, we also see that they are beginning to break the rules. We’ll also be looking at an important villa at Boscotrecase. There was a kitchen, an extensive kitchen, over here as well. And, in fact, as far as the transition from the Second to the Third Style, the cycle of styles seems to suggest that at the time that the Second Style was at its most popular was just when those who owned these houses wanted to move on to something new, understandably. And if you look carefully, you will see that the coloration is similar: the famous Pompeian red, a nice maroon, some black, some gold used here. These lintels don’t project–they’re just straight lintels, they’re not broken in any way–and they too are very delicate, and from a distance look like a stripe against the wall, not like a lintel. But I think you can see that it is not a window into something that lies beyond, because the scene is contained within this frame, and what the artist has done is outlined the frame with a very black, dark black outline. And if you look at both–and we’ll look at them in detail again momentarily–if you look at the citharist, and if you look at the peacocks, you see that they are standing on ground lines, but ground lines that don’t look like they have any depth; in fact, they’re standing somewhere where you couldn’t really stand, which is one of the interesting features of Third Style, again this desire to move and to respect the flatness of the wall. His toes do seem to be projecting a bit over those. There’s some speculation that he may have lived in this villa at some point. Which is very important because it suggests to us not only that the finest artists of the day must have been working on these, as they did in Rome for the House of Augustus, or in Primaporta for the Villa of Livia, but also leads me, at least, to speculate that it’s possible that these interesting transitions from Second to Third Style, and Third Style to Fourth Style, may have come at the behest of the artists who were these very high-level artists who were working in the imperial employ. So here we have the Red Room of the Villa of Agrippa Postumus at Boscotrecase, and we can see some of the same features that we saw in Caldarium 8 of the Villa at Oplontis. So mature Second Style, commissioned by an imperial patron; mature Third Style, commissioned by, we think, an imperial patron. There’s nothing more here than a panel picture that hangs on a wall. And I remind you of one of the First Style Roman wall paintings that we looked at together. We also see that it has been divided into painted zones: red at the bottom, black in the center, black also at the top. But as you walk into this room and look at them from a distance, they look like gold stripes on a flat back wall. It’s very–it’s really fascinatingly done, I think. The leaves are beautifully rendered, beautifully rendered, but they are all rendered essentially the same. You can also see that the architectural members that there are, are very attenuated and look like stripes on the wall from a distance. So very much again another example of Third Style Roman wall painting. But it is a different architecture than we’ve ever seen before, because we never see a complete building. We see over here a mythological panel with a black frame around it that is meant to look like a panel picture hanging on a flat wall. All of that is exactly what we saw in the Third Style. We’re going to begin with Garden Room Q, which is the one that you see here; which you can see, from the Monument List, we believe dates to 62 to 70 A.D.; Garden Room Q. Now if all of Garden Room Q that was preserved, was the bottom part–if you didn’t have that very top zone, and I asked you what style is this? It is a room in which the color gold abounds. But again these are not full buildings, as we would see in the Second Style, but these fragments in illogical space. But this is quintessential, quintessential Fourth Style Roman wall painting. You can see the decoration in the friezes. It certainly makes reference to things theatrical."
677,history-art,hsar-252,lecture-8,"Professor Kleiner discusses special subjects in Roman wall painting that do not fall within the four architectural styles but were nonetheless inserted into their wall schemes: mythological painting, landscape, genre, still life, history painting, and painted portraiture. The lecture begins with an in-depth examination of the unique Dionysiac Mysteries painting in Pompeii in which young brides prepare for and enter into a mystical marriage with the god Dionysus and simultaneous initiation into his cult. Professor Kleiner then presents a painted frieze from Rome that depicts the wanderings of Odysseus against a continuous landscape framed by Second Style columns. She subsequently analyzes Roman still life, remarkable in its similarity to modern still life painting; a scene of daily life in Pompeii; and a painting depicting a specific historical event–a riot in the Pompeii Amphitheater that caused the arena to be shut down for ten years. The lecture ends with a discussion of painted portraiture on Pompeian walls, including likenesses of two different women holding a similar stylus and wax tablet.","The title of today’s lecture is “Exploring Special Subjects on Pompeian Walls.” We ended last time with a discussion of Fourth Style Roman wall painting, and I want to show you again what I consider the quintessential Fourth Style wall. So all of these elements, as I said, a compendium of all of these painting styles, all in one place, is where Roman painting ends up right before the destruction of Mount Vesuvius. This is a view of Room 5 as it looks today. And you can also see that this is like nothing we’ve looked at thus far this semester, in that what we have here are a series of very large, monumental figures that seem to walk around the room in a kind of procession, and you see those extremely well here. And I wanted to point out, using this image, that again about how sophisticated this particular artist was, because he takes into consideration, as I mentioned before, the corners of the room, and they become part of the narrative. As you can see here, there’s an empty space, but the story line, as we’ll see, continues across the corner, and the figures over here interact with the figures on the other side of the bend in the wall, in again a very, very sophisticated and interesting way, and we’ll follow that through. Notice also the way in which her lips are slightly parted, and especially the hair. She is holding some kind of a dish, and she has on that dish probably–it’s very hard to identify exactly what’s there–but she has probably some items that have something to do with this cult, with this mystical marriage of these Pompeian women with Dionysus. What is she fleeing from; what is she afraid of? I don’t think this artist always gets the hands right. Again you get–it’s just wonderful the way he has achieved showing this satyr on one hand greedily drinking from the cup, but at the same time with one eye–you can see one eye, and that one eye is very much on what it is that he’s doing. And you can also see that he’s so drunk that although he’s kept one sandal on, he’s lost the other sandal. The next scene that we see is also a very interesting scene and a very important one. And we see here the discovery of the most important cult object in this scene, which is the phallus. Very possibly, that’s exactly what it is, that would have been kept again in this basket, but is underneath here. Over here we see another fascinating figure. And because she looks a little bit older, because she looks a little bit wiser, because she is looking out at the panorama of what’s happening in front of her, it has been speculated, and I think quite convincingly, that the woman we see here is probably the matron of the house – probably the wife of the man who owned and built the Villa of the Mysteries in Pompeii, who was herself an adherent to the cult of Dionysus, and has set aside this secret room in her house for the cult of Dionysus in which she can help initiate other young women into this mystery cult. Just one, a couple of quick words about religion and cults during this period. So Church and State very closely allied in Roman times. But the figures are very small in relation to the landscape. One of those is that passage in Vitruvius that I already mentioned. So it’s a Romanization of an original Greek painting, in an extraordinary way that tells us a good deal about how the Romans were thinking about these Greek prototypes at this particular juncture. They’re so small that they’re lost in the overall scheme. Just a few words about what we might call history painting, among the Romans. But it seems to have happened, and it is memorialized, that very event is memorialized in this painting, in this house at Pompeii. This painting is also very valuable–I think I’ve mentioned this to you before–is also very valuable, not only for showing us the shape of the amphitheater–which, of course, as you know, still survives–the oval shape and the seating, but for a detail that doesn’t still survive, and that is the awning. As you can see down below, the hair is magnificently rendered. You can see that she has a bevy of corkscrew curls. You can see that he holds a scroll, which has a red place marker up above."
678,history-art,hsar-252,lecture-9,"Professor Kleiner discusses the transformation of Rome by its first emperor, Augustus, who claimed to have found Rome a city of brick and left it a city of marble. The conversion was made possible by the exploitation of new marble quarries at Luna (modern Carrara) on the northwest coast of Italy. The lecture surveys the end of the Roman Republic and the inauguration of the Principate and analyzes the Forum of Julius Caesar and the Forum of Augustus. Professor Kleiner shines a spotlight on Caesar’s attempt to link himself to his divine ancestress Venus Genetrix and on Augustus’ appropriations of Greek caryatids and other decorative motifs that associate his era with the Golden Age of Periclean Athens. Finally, she analyzes the Ara Pacis Augustae, a monument commissioned upon Augustus’ return to Rome after achieving diplomatic victories in Spain and Gaul, and serving as the Luna marble embodiment of the emperor’s new hegemonic empire.","Back to Rome today, back to Rome, which was beginning to emerge as the world’s, or the ancient world’s, greatest superpower, an emergence that we’re going to see had a profound impact on Roman architecture. She commissioned it for a building that she and Caesar were putting up in Alexandria, called the Caesareum that honored Caesar, and you can see that he is represented as he was–it’s a quite realistic portrait with the lines and wrinkles, with his receding hairline and so on accentuated in this portrait. But Caesar got the upper hand, at the end of the day, and it was Caesar who defeated Pompey the Great at a very famous battle, the Battle of Pharsalus, which took place in 48 B.C. After the Battle of Pharsalus and his defeat by Julius Caesar, Pompey fled to Egypt where he was murdered, and in fact the Egyptians slit Pompey’s head, put it on a plate and presented it to Caesar. Now you’d think Caesar would have been happy about that. But in 45 B.C., by 45 B.C., he had returned to Rome. And I think one of the explanations for this is the time that Caesar spent in Alexandria, in Egypt, with Cleopatra. But many of these ambitions were cut short by his assassination in 44 B.C. He was not able to achieve architecturally all that he had hoped. But it also was based in part on a building that we have not looked at and which no longer survives, but we have information about, and that is that Caesareum, or Caesareum of Julius Caesar, that he and Cleopatra put up in Alexandria. So a great open rectangular space, open to the sky, with colonnades on either side. We can see it in plan, and it dominates the space in front of it, just as the Capitolium did at Pompeii. The closest thing probably to it is something like, for those of you who know it–Botticelli’s [] in Florence is probably sort of the idea here for emerging from the waters, and her depiction in this particular pediment above. You can see the façade orientation, although again there was a staircase on three sides of that podium. But at any rate, Mark Antony takes up with Cleopatra and he joins her in Egypt and he spends a good deal of his time in the eastern part of the Empire with his paramour. Octavian very smartly realized Antony is distracted. “ But this is a very informative list indeed, and it shows us that to Augustus, as to Caesar before him, the building of buildings was extremely important: the making of buildings not only to remake Rome as a great city of the ancient world, but also to leave something for posterity, and, of course, both of them were successful in both of those objectives. You can also see, in this very good view, one of the hemicycles on the left-hand side, and you can see those niches that I mentioned before, that would have held statuary that you could see through the columns. But I show it to you to make one point, and that is that it seems very likely that there was some interesting architectural exchange–ideas, architects and so on–going on between Athens and Rome in the late Republican period, in the time of Julius Caesar and into the age of Augustus, and it’s an issue that we’ll return to in the future. How many of you think this is the Greek one? But most important for us is the fact that these maidens have clear precedents in the Greek world. This is Venus, and Venus, as you can see, has something on her left shoulder. They were able to shed a fair number of years and were depicted in much younger versions in their divinized state. To return to the plan quickly, just to make the point that the sculptural program–we’re concerned here primarily with architecture–but the sculptural program was very complicated, but very interesting, and the figures were very carefully aligned with one another to get the message across. If you were allowed to walk into the temple, which usually only the priests could do, you would see the cult statue with Mars Ultor in the center there. There are two possible precedents or two possible references that are being made here. But we see here a sacrifice itself where the animal victims are being brought in for slaughter. And I show you a detail of that frieze; a frieze, the subject matter of which is somewhat controversial. The frieze on the south side has a portrait of Augustus himself. Fortunately Meier kept that and kept that wall as part of his own building. This is the interesting inscription that makes reference to Mussolini. That’s how carefully orchestrated it was, and the fact that there is an Egyptian obelisk, and there’s mention in the inscription on that obelisk of the victory over Cleopatra and Antony, at the Battle of Actium, and that the Ara Pacis commemorates his diplomatic treaties in the western part of the Empire, in France and Spain, seems to me to be a reference to the fact that Augustus was victorious in all parts of the Roman Empire: the western as well as the eastern part of the Empire, referenced here."
679,history-art,hsar-252,paper-topics,"Professor Kleiner presents the three options for the course’s term paper, which fall into two main categories: a research paper or a project to design a Roman city. For the research paper, she suggests cities and monuments not covered or mentioned briefly in the lectures, which embody some of the themes and issues raised in the course. Such topics include, in the Eastern Empire, the Roman cities of Corinth and Gerasa (Jerash), the Library of Celsus at Ephesus, and the Temple of Bel and the tower tombs at Palmyra. In the West, possible subjects are the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum; funerary architecture in Pompeii; a Roman villa at Fishbourne; Roman baths at Bath; and the private houses at Vaison-la-Romaine. Students may also study a site or monument of their choice, provided that the topic is pre-approved by Professor Kleiner. The lecture concludes with an overview of the “Design a Roman City” option, in which students draw or generate plans and other representations of a hypothetical Roman city of 10,000 inhabitants, accompanied by a paper supporting their proposal.","We will be returning the exams on Thursday. And again, as I mentioned, it’s also a good chance for us to begin to experience the provinces of the Roman Empire. So I do urge you, if you have a pretty good sense of what it is that you may want to work on, and want to pick up a book or two before you leave for Spring Break, the next couple of days would be the time to do that. This is a view, for example, of the Greek Archaic Temple at Corinth. All the obvious questions that you would want to put to this particular structure. It was rebuilt over a number of years and that got changed over time. And I show you here, for example, the very well-preserved Arch of Augustus at Ephesus, which gives you the sense of the kind of stone construction that was used for that. And it’s very different from built architecture in Rome, of the same period. Now the building that I recommend, if you want to work on Ephesus – there are other possibilities, you could work on that Temple of Hadrian, for example–but the one that I think has the richest opportunities for an outstanding paper, and an interesting paper as well, and an interesting research adventure, is the Library of Celsus in Ephesus. He was the benefactor who wanted to splash his own name on this library, the purpose of the library being a library for everybody who lived in Ephesus. We’ve seen this before, but only in painting. I said that was the first example in Rome of what we might call the “baroque” trend in Roman architecture, where this motion is injected into the façade. You can pick out all the obvious components of a miniature Rome. And you can see that they conform to the shape of a typical Roman theater. We haven’t seen tetrapylons in Rome, and in fact the Romans didn’t build tetrapylons in the city. There is no ancient Roman town in Italy that has a colonnaded street. But the building again in Palmyra, that I think is by far the most intriguing, and makes a perfect paper topic–because one can try to decode which aspects of this are Roman and which aspects of this are local, and that’s essentially the name of the game when you try–when you go out into the Roman provinces, to try to determine what it is; in what ways has what’s going on in the capital had impact on what’s happening in the provinces, and what local traditions are so strong that they continue to exist, and even resurface, in some of these buildings? So that is characteristic of what kind of temple architecture? The building still stands, or part of it, and you can see it here. And so after they unearthed it, after they drew it, they covered it back over again. This is the plan of the Villa of the Papyri, as it was drawn, when it was originally excavated. They have just–if you saw this a few years ago and haven’t been back, they have made some additions in the last several years, including their version of a theater–and you can see it here–an ancient theater, which you can see here, with the  and with the , or wedge-shaped sections of seats. And you can even see at the Fishbourne Villa, for example, a private bath, with the hypocaust. Another view of that, where you can see some of the stone construction. So here–this is what you do when you go and you take the easy way out. And this is my favorite tomb on the Via Nucera in Pompeii, because it should remind you of something we saw earlier when we looked at Roman tomb architecture. But it does have some interesting houses. So very similar to the kinds of things that we saw in Pompeii. The only thing that I ask–and you do need to do a paper along with this as well, which is a paper that you’ll see from the–so there need to be drawings, which are either hand drawn or computer generated. So it’s going to take you some time to do. This is a wonderful city that someone created on a harbor. There’s some misspellings, like over here; Livian Baths, I guess after Livia. But I love, at 6, the curia; you never see a round curia, but this is a round curia, which is absolutely terrific, opening off the basilica, which you see over here, which is very closely based on basilican architecture of the Trajanic Period, and into the Severan period. I can’t even imagine how long this text took him to write on this scroll, but it was a long scroll and it came and it was tied up with a nice ribbon and so on and so forth, and you unfurled it and it had the text, all about his town. So interspersed with this text were these wonderful drawings of what he had in mind."
680,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-10,"In this lecture, Professor Mazzotta introduces  and proceeds with a close reading of Cantos I and II. The topography of Mount Purgatory is described, and the moral system it structures is contrasted with that of Hell. Dante’s paradoxical choice of Cato, a pagan suicide, as guardian to the entrance of Purgatory ushers in a discussion of freedom from the standpoint of classical antiquity, on the one hand, and Judaism, on the other. In his refusal to be enslaved by the past, both on earth and in the afterlife, Cato is seen to embody the virtues of exile, setting an example for the penitent souls of Ante-purgatory ( II), including the pilgrim, who still clings to the comforts of the past.",": Today we will begin  which is a word meaning place of cleansing, purification and is the middle section of the poem, literally a place of transition between the world of Hell, and all the evil that we have witnessed, and then, the realm of glory which is going to be Paradise. The other thing that you should keep in mind about Purgatory, and the difficulties that the poet will have, is the following. A further trait of  which was really completely missing in , we had never had a sense of time. This idea of time, this will become truly a leitmotif throughout Purgatory. The future is the only thing that Dante is going to be interested in and the future will come in the possibility of a future, and the way it’s related to the past will become the object of his concerns, the object of his thinking openly as he goes through the various ledges of Purgatory. The song — the dawn song, a song that in many ways reverses the grand tradition of the erotic lyrics of Provençal poetry where the dawn becomes the unhappy time for the parting of lovers and here now its regained as the great time when, finally, the pilgrim can go on and the poet can go on mapping, literally now mapping the journey, sailing through or sending as the metaphor that he asks — that he adopts can be. That the journey of the poet is an extension; it, in itself, is a journey — in of itself is a journey of knowledge and the journey of discovery. It’s a conventional way of thinking about the bark of poetry with which he is — there seems to be a way of saying this is now more — at this stage, at least, he wants us to think about the journey of poetry and not just the journey that he himself will use — will undertake the journey of the pilgrim, the hard, difficult journey filled with fear that he was experiencing in .I also want to draw your attention to another little detail of the text. Beatrice has just died and then the death of Beatrice brings to his mind the fear and threat of mortality to him. Not the sort of spectacular shades of light, the blue, the reds, the green with which he experiences and dramatizes  according to the lights emanating from the various planets, the red of Mars, the white of Jupiter, the blue of Saturn and so there is a kind of polychromic palette that is going to be deployed. That the way in which we can be orienting ourselves is by trying to capture the source of that light. The first thing that he wonders and he says, paragraph, “Who are ye that I have fled,” these are just people who have tried to literally escape from prison, “the eternal prison against the blind stream?’ I was sent to him … I have shown him all the guilty race and now purpose to show him those spirits that cleanse themselves under thy charge. He goes seeking liberty which is so dear, as he knows who gives his life for it. Freedom is to the fundamental problem, it’s a Roman issue let me just say. Now there is an obvious relationship to begin with between freedom, on the one hand, and, I would say, the future on the other. When we were at a part where the dew resists the sun and, being in shade, is little dispersed, my Master gently laid both hands outspread on the grass. Now we are here with a different pagan. “ for as was the lowly plant he chose such did it spring up again immediately in the place where he had plucked it. And then an angel of God, “Then as the divine bird came towards us more and more, he appeared brighter, so that my eyes could not bear,” line 38, “I cast them down and he came on the shore with a vessel so swift and light that the water took in nothing of it. It is as if he understands that there are two traditions, both of which are based on a quest for liberty. By the way, a second thing I can say about this reference to Psalm 113 is that Dante uses it as the basis for explaining his use of allegory. That secular knowledge is also part of what we must carry with us in the journey toward freedom. He literally has — he does not know where to go. Wonder, I think, was painted in my looks, at which the shade smiled and drew back and I, following him, pressed forward. This is the first, and there will be two more that I will talk about as we proceed. “ And in fact, the great poem that he recalls, a past epic tradition is Lucan and he chooses Lucan, because Lucan is — so I’m coming back to your question and trying to welcome it and say that indeed, it’s possible, but I have to explain why I think it’s possible. The polemic of Lucan towards Virgil is that Virgil — sure he had been talking about the foundation of Rome and for the Roman there is nothing more historical than that — as you know, the Romans are the — some practical people that will count — will calculate history from the foundation of the city. But not of human history: Dante wants to make it part of human history. So what gives about this tension since I’m talking about a tension between two modes of poetry."
681,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-11,"This lecture covers  V, VI, IX and X. The purgatorial theme of freedom introduced in the previous lecture is revisited in the context of Canto V, where Buonconte da Montefeltro’s appearance among the last minute penitents is read as a critique of the genealogical bonds of natural necessity. The poet passes from natural to civic ancestry in VI, where the mutual affection of Virgil and Sordello, a former citizen of the classical poet’s native Mantua, sparks an invective against the mutual enmity that enslaves contemporary Italy. The transition from ante-Purgatory to Purgatory proper in Canto IX leads to an elaboration on the moral and poetic structure of , exemplified on the terrace of pride in Canto X.","Last time, I was arguing with you about some of the novelties that Dante introduces within the poem at the start of . Though this communal fate appears as defeated. It’s always possible to fall back, reflect, and turn one’s life around. A moment where he did experience violence and he perpetrated violence. To the place where its name is lost I came, wounded in the throat, flying on foot, and bloodying the plain. It’s a sort of — an epitaph of La Pia, who was mistreated here by the husband and yet incredibly forgiving and the word ends — and the passage ends with the word gem which in Italian is , Dante’s wife’s name. Such was I in that dense crowd, turning my face to them this way and that, and by promising I got free from them. But one thing is clear: that Dante understands that the relationship between — and that’s all I’m going to say unless you press me a little later but we’ll talk more about this metaphor — Dante understands that the relationship between the soul and God is a relationship shaped by risk on both sides, and that this idea of risk that would seem to be a blind casting of the dice in effect constitutes the freedom that the human beings can have in the scheme of things. And this is the Boethian scheme of harmonizing God’s foreknowledge and human freedom. That triggers Dante’s political invective against Italy. Of course he’s saying literally in this digression, you are so much better than all these other towns. Dante moves on talking about the first night of  will take place and he takes refuge in the so-called Valley of the Princes, where a new garden, another garden is going to be described, which in many ways fulfills the garden of Limbo in Canto IV of . I want to read the first passage which is the — an evening song. It is the pilgrimage of desire, which is the poem, the poem of desire, desire for God, desire for Beatrice, now turns into the desire for the comfort and the shelter of the home he had lost."
682,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-12,"In this lecture, Professor Mazzotta moves from the terrace of pride ( X-XII) to the terrace of wrath (XVI-XVII). The relationship between art and pride, introduced in the previous lecture in the context of Canto X, is pursued along theological lines in the cantos immediately following. The “ludic theology” Dante embraces in these cantos resurfaces on the terrace of wrath, where Marco Lombardo’s speech on the traditional problem of divine foreknowledge and human freedom highlights the playfulness of God’s creation. The motifs of human and divine creation explored thus far are shown to converge at the numerical center of the poem ( XVII) in Dante’s apostrophe to the imagination.","Last time then we talked about the cantos of pride. A little widow who has been asking for justice before he departs, justice for the death of her son. And Dante is not really capable of deciphering them or having even sympathy with them. Why is it that man desires to be made sad? If I think that I can take a safe distance, it’s because I do not want to look within myself. God is not in space and therefore He is really everywhere, or He is free. An infinite sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference nowhere. The point of that poem is that it begins with the look of human beings up to the highest and then it ends up with the idea of humility. This is what we call a visible speech that Dante himself has been deploying, and to do this I have to ask you to look at the Italian text that begins with the word — every tercet with the letter V, though I’m sure you would like me to read a little bit of the Italian: … , , the next tercet , next . He is, in a sense, redefining the ethical language of the Middle Ages and the ethical language of his own text. Do you see what — is it — do you want me to say this again? the world is blind and indeed thou comest from it. You that are living refer every cause up to the heavens alone, just as if they moved all things with them by necessity. If it were so, free choice would be destroyed.” ”Which in Italian it really is, I have to say, more of an oxymoron, line 80: . “And that creates the mind in you which the heavens have not in their charge. It is the basis of what I call the playful theology of Dante. Dante is — we are approaching the center of the universe, this poetic universe, and Dante reminds us that this is a work of the imagination. There’s such a power — in other words, it’s not just the imagination that translates sensory experiences into images for the benefit of rational judgment: this is the triadic Aristotelian order; the imagination has the middle ground between the senses, the work of the perception and the work of reason. Unsurprisingly, this is a fabric of love, an architecture of love, and it’s at the very center, lines 91, 92, and 93 — that this is the actual numerically even, in the center the poem — not surprising, that’s what Dante says, “Neither Creator nor creature, my son, was ever without love, either natural or of the mind. “While it is directed on the primal good and on the secondary keeps right measure, it cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure; but when it is warped to evil, or with more or with less concern than is due pursues its good against the Creator works his creature. Everyone confusedly apprehends the good at which the mind may be at rest and desires it, so that each strives to reach it, and if the love is sluggish that draws you to see or gain it, this terrace, after due repentance, torments you for that. There cannot be a sin unless there is a will involved. In , the argument here seems to be — the way I have been following it from Cantos XV, XVI, XVII and the way it’s going to be developed in XVIII and actually frankly XIX, where Dante goes on telling a dream — Dante makes the word of love the crucial act of our being in the word, relating us to God, we are related to God, really born through the way of love, therefore, the way of the heart and not unnecessarily through some abstract metaphysical issues. That, to me, is the issue, that’s how I have been moving this issue. Do I need a transgression in order to come to God? He is invoking the humblest voice of the whole literary tradition up to this time, the . We seem to believe or to think in terms of the light that is available to us, but that does not necessarily produce more light, but can dim our understanding about the way things really are. ”The question is, you want me to say something about the mirror, the image of the mirror that is being used here. I don’t know that I have ever spoken of him, I will because Dante mentions him in , but in , Dante — the Pseudo-Dionysius — thinks of all creation being a kind of occasion — being a kind of hall of mirrors where everything is reflected onto the other, a number of reflections that all give different light — in different ways the light of God, this is so — that’s where the problem of mercy places us, so this idea of charity."
683,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-13,"This lecture deals primarily with  XIX, XXI and XXII. The ambiguity of the imagination discussed in the preceding lecture as the selfsame path to intellectual discovery and disengagement is explored in expressly poetic terms. While the pilgrim’s dream of the siren in  XIX warns of the death-dealing power of aesthetics, the encounter between Statius and Virgil in the cantos that follow points to its life-giving potential by casting poetry as a means of conversion.","We talked the last time — I talked a little about this whole issue of the imagination that Dante places, along with a definition of love, and the — and love is the power that governs, that shapes the moral world of . That Dante should place the imagination at the center of the poem should really not surprise you. Dante understands that there is an imagination which cannot quite be held in check, and yet the whole point of the poem I’m talking — whenever I’m talking about the poem, I point out some seemingly insignificant details like, oh look this is a symmetry here between Canto VI of , Canto VI of , or whatever, to indicate that it is a poem built with a precise principle of order in mind. But at the same time along side with it, and this is the complexity and the beauty of Dante’s text, this is another argument that almost questions, makes us — forces us into thinking that there are some elements that seem to be left out of this fabric of order that Dante has woven, or if you like, the metaphor has built — the architecture that he has built. As you know, we are talking about imagination and love, and there is an imagination that somehow is vagabond. Remember that the image with which Canto XVII starts, Dante places us in a world which is at the twilight. That made it a little difficult to try to get a hold of — grasp. Canto XVIII begins with a question that he asks of Virgil. perhaps because its matter always seems good, but not every stamp is good, even if it be good wax.” I finally have some revelations within me which is not what I would normally have if I were awake, so this is the great privilege that they give to dreams. Are the Middle Ages really conscious of this dimension? It starts then with, “In the hour when the day’s heat, overcome by the earth and sometimes by Saturn, can no longer temper the cold of the moon, when the geomancers see their Fortuna Major rise in the east before dawn by a path which does not long stay dark for it, there came to me in dream a woman stammering, cross-eyed and crooked on her feet with maimed hands and of sallow hue. Jupiter and justice, Saturn is astronomy, also the planet of contemplation. One is the object of some dreams or apparitions, or signs, images that descend into one’s self without one’s own self control or dominion over there. He is the one who brings the world into being through language. And when Dante meets Adam, there will be some interesting details that we can talk about there, but I can anticipate this for you: Adam is the one who had understood transgression and that transgression though, for Adam, appears as a sort of growth. One sweet, meretricious and false, but a sweet song; the other one very harsh, who says the journey is not over. Two forms of love, two forms of poetry, two types of women. But it’s not a question of making them agree, only because they had two different visions, that in and of itself may not be all that difficult. This is the difference that Dante has from the classical world. It’s really much the world of the , the world of Aristotle. It’s really speaking of Rome having a kind of power that usually will lead with love, with desire, the pull of desire. This is not going to, I think, interfere very much because it’s the works, the works of art that we are going to be talking about in Canto XXII.The two poets now are self — each in acknowledgement of the other and they go on talking about line 10 and following, Virgil asks Statius to explain to him why this moral blight existed in him, why this sin of avarice, and he says — this is the passage: “Love,” Canto XXII, lines 12 and following, “Love kindled by virtue always kindles another” — That’s the sort of vitality and power of love. It’s not self-enclosed; it’s one that goes on creating and propagating itself. “From the hour, therefore, when Juvenal descended among us in the LImbo of Hell and made thy affection known to me my goodwill toward thee was as great as ever held anyone for a person not seen, so that now these stairs will seem short to me. Dante has to be aware that there were efforts to Christianize this idea. Then in fact he goes on acknowledging, once again, Statius, for his moral conversion. He’s dismembering, he is taking one side over — there’s a much more complicated version of the meaning of the word. Why is this sort of — why is this theme of sort of the Adam theme coming up here in XIX and is there some sort of strand that I’m missing? I would say that — I sort of resist the — hearing here the figure of — in the figure of Adam because Adam doesn’t really talk about falling. Why does he go back to this reference to the siren? For Ulysses, she also represents the extraordinary enchantment of the song that would lead him to death because that’s what happens to all those who listen to the siren."
684,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-14,"Guest lecturer Professor David Lummus discusses  XXIV-XXVI. On the terraces of gluttony and lust, the pilgrim’s encounters with masters of the Italian love lyric give rise to the ’s most sustained treatment of poetics. Through Dante’s older contemporary Bonagiunta ( XXIV), the pilgrim distinguishes the poetic style of his youth from that of the courtly love tradition pursued by his interlocutor. In  XXVI, Dante reinforces his own poetic genealogy through his encounter with Guido Guinizelli, founder of the Sweet New Style of poetry he crafted in his youth. The interpretative key to the language of paternity and filiation that pervades these cantos is found in  XXV, where Statius’ embryological exposition of the divine creation of the soul conveys the divinity of poetic inspiration.","I’m Professor David Lummus and Professor Mazzotta asked me to come in and substitute for him today, since he’s traveling and can’t be here. Today, we’re going to be talking about Cantos XXIV and XXVI specifically, but I’ll be saying a few words also about Cantos XXIII and XXV, as a kind of frame to those two . “He that goes before me turned me from that life some days ago. It’s interesting that Bonagiunta who notices that Dante is different because Bonagiunta da Lucca wrote a poem to Guido Guinizelli, who we will meet in XXVI, criticizing how he had brought the terminology of the university, the terminology of epistemology, and of metaphysics, and of theology into the lyric of love. It’s — that’s probably one of the reasons why Bonagiunta da Lucca comes out here. Now this inspiration, I think, it needs to be understood in a theological — needs to be understood theologically. Here again, we have this lack of moral understanding. He’s — if there is a school of the , if there is this Sweet New Style which composes a school — like the Sicilian school that preceded it, which I’m sure Professor Mazzotta talked about in relation to the  — then Dante is creating something new within that school. Now, my son, develops and spreads the force that is from the heart of the begetter, where nature makes provision for all the members. They imitate each other, they parallel each other. The connection between , the child who speaks is a direct connection to language, the language of poetry. Dante, I guess, he loses his faculty of speech here, because he’s in awe almost like a child before his father. We have one that recognizes the paternity of the father, while at the same time, allows the son to come into his own, and that’s coming into his own is, I think, pointed out by Dante the poet whenever he says at — between lines 130 and 140: “Then perhaps to give place to others who were near him, he disappeared through the fire as though the water — as through the water a fish goes to the bottom. ”What these poets couldn’t recognize in their own lifetime Dante is able to because of his poetry, this bringing together that he does, which is actually the newness in the Sweet New Style, I think, which isn’t just metaphysical, but it’s theological. Then he hid himself from the fire that refines him. If these poets are cleansed by this wall of — by this fire that refines them, he will end up passing through a wall of flame in order to get to where he can enter into the terrestrial paradise. Technically, but the fact that he actually asked Virgil first — I don’t know, maybe he’s saying that it’s actually Aristotle, this idea of the immortality of the soul and the after — it’s actually there and perhaps Virgil could answer it, but then Virgil defers to Statius because it’s a theological question that he’s not privy to."
685,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-15,"This lecture deals with Dante’s representation of the Earthly Paradise at the summit of Mount Purgatory. The quest for freedom begun under the aegis of Cato in  I reaches its denouement at the threshold of Eden, where Virgil proclaims the freedom of the pilgrim’s will ( XXVII). Left with pleasure as his guide, the pilgrim nevertheless falls short of a second Adam in his encounter with Matelda. His lingering susceptibility to earthly delights is underscored at the arrival of Beatrice ( XXX) whose harsh treatment of the pilgrim is read as a retrospective gloss on the dream of the Siren in  XIX. By dramatizing his character’s failings within the Earthly Paradise, Dante replaces the paradigm of conversion as a once-for-all event with that of an ongoing process to be continued in Paradise under the guidance of Beatrice.","With Canto XXVI, the purgation of the pilgrim is completed. These are the last words that he speaks from lines 130 on, “The temporal fire and the eternal thou hast seen,” meaning Purgatory and Hell which lasts forever, “my son, and art come to a part where of myself I discern no further.” Virgil is speaking of the pilgrim as if he were speaking of the ground that thrives until the ground, the land produces spontaneously. Now he’s capable at spontaneous action and spontaneous decisions. It began in the wilderness and ends in the Garden. Now the pilgrim is his own responsibility. Dante reverses this, the point that seems to be the most mature is that dealing with the aesthetic one, which others may view as the superficial, the elementary one, the one where we are — perceptions are going to be engaged and then at the time of disengagement even before you can get involved and mature in ethical experiences. Once you are in  you can only enjoy and get to know the world. You already read a kind of segment which I will call the literary segment that — with Professor Lummus whom I’m very grateful to — covered and explained to you and did with you last time. You may have seen adumbrations of this even in Limbo. To give you the sense of how some resonance — and in case you’re stilling for a term that — the final paper topic you might want to read — there is a poem — there is a traditional poetry which is really Provençal called . So the erotics of the previous canto continues now here. ”He’s scared and turns to Virgil and is about to say, and will say the famous lines, “I know the marks of the ancient flame,” which is a translation of the words Dido will speak when she meets Aeneas in Hades: “I know the marks of the ancient flame,” another image of death and mortality taken from the . Dante now is alone, so that’s what I call the self-confrontation with his past. This is a contemporary visionary like Borges, not Dante. Dante, this is you, the specificity and irreducibility of his own experience. There is a little phrase that Dante’s using, or Beatrice is using for him: “another time,” when you hear the siren, which means that the siren is not just the encounter with the siren. Not for all the time shall the eagle,” probably the eagle of the empire, “be without heir that left its feathers on the car so that it became monster, and then prey; for I see assuredly, and therefore tell of it, stars already near, to give us the time, secure from all check and hindrance, when a five hundred, ten and five, one sent from God, shall slay the thievish woman and the giant who sins with her. The two, humanity and divinity join together by the X of the cross. If he believed in this, and this is to be understood as an apocalyptic symbol of an imminent end of time, this would make Dante what is called a Joachist, and I have to explain to you who this man is. Then there is the age of the son that goes from the time of the incarnation to roughly 1260, his own time. What is interesting is that he’s thinking of memory and forgetfulness, the Lethe and Eunoe, as entailing each other, so that there’s no erasure which is not at the same time a memory, that each contains the other and Dante will go — has a lot to say about forgetful memory, especially in the way the poem will be written. You mentioned a transition from the ethical in  to the aesthetic in . That’s when the ethics is really — you can say that it has done its job as it were. So we enter a world where now is the world of  and Dante goes on representing this world. He celebrates the greatest aspects of human life: work, love, things that join — joy — the community together. In fact, it’s both, the poetic and the religious, and we can say that even about the philosophical if you wish, they respond to profound impulses within us."
686,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-16,"Professor Mazzotta introduces students to . The Ptolemaic structure of Dante’s cosmos is described along with the arts and sciences associated with its spheres. Beatrice’s role as teacher in Dante’s cosmological journey is distinguished from that of her successor, St. Bernard of Clairvaux. An introduction to Dante’s third and final guide to the Beatific Vision helps situate the poetics of  vis-à-vis the mystical tradition. Professor Mazzotta’s introduction to the canticle is followed by a close reading of the first canto. The end of the pilgrim’s journey is discussed in light of the two theological modes Dante pulls together in the exordium of  I. The poetic journey staged in the opening tercets is then explored in light of the mythological and Christian figures (Marsyas, St. Paul) Dante claims as his poetic precursors.","We begin with , which clearly is different from the earthly paradise, two paradises. Then the Heaven of Mars, the god of war, which here Dante couples with music in the persuasion that music is a harmony made of discordant parts. Whereas, the Heaven of the Empyrean is really the heaven of metaphysics as Dante will call it and you will see the kind of interesting arguments that Dante will have, because in effect he has changed his mind when writing the philosophical text known as the , as you know now , he writes it in Italian. It’s not some kind of allegory of nature. And from one point of view that defeat for the Christian would also be of course a victory but Dante is suspended between the two poles. What is this beauty skin deep, as it were, because that’s really one of the dangers of focusing on beauty that it’s really the surface of things, the appearance of things. The other item in this first tercet is that of the — that I want to emphasize is the principle of hierarchy. More of this a little bit later, as we go on. “I saw things which he that has the sense from it has now the knowledge or the power to tell again and then he explains why. You may remember this is a recall of the dream of Parnassus in  that we saw when Statius and Virgil were flattered into believing that what they had dreamt is actually the simulacrum of the earthly paradise. First of all, he had introduced this image of himself as a vessel receptive to the inspiration of Apollo, now the language of even violence “on the arena” where there is sports, where battles are fought, enter into the arena — now entering “on the arena that remains” and now look at this, “Come into my breast and breathe there as when thou drewest Marsyas from the scabbard of his limbs,” an echo of the struggle between the poet and the god. Remember the possibility of hubris, in other words. So seldom, father, are they gathered for triumph of Caesar or of poet — fault and shame of human wills — that Peneian bow must beget gladness in the glad Delphic god when it makes any long for it. The emphasis falls — and the distance between — the Ovidian account of Glaucus who believes that he’s immortal and jumps into the water of the tasting of some herbs, and Dante himself has indicated by that little preposition ‘within.’ There are levels of vision that they emphasize. His own poetic powers, his own subjectivity between two different modalities. As you know, he makes references to the Garden of Eden in terms of the park, the pinewood, the wood of pine trees around the city, and we do know that he would live and die in Ravenna. It’s the — Dante writes — you know that, this is the tenth letter of a number of letters that he writes. This idea is implied to us by the Apostle addressing the Corinthians,” the passage I just read, “where he writes, “I knew a man, whether in the body or out of the body I know not, God knoweth, who was caught up to the third heaven and who heard secret words who it is not granted to man — which it is not granted to man to author. It may be true in the Bible that they are two — Dante thinks that the two will go together. You have to have vision in order to speak and that’s really what the — it helps us understand the sense of poetry with which Dante invokes here at the beginning of .Let me go now, Dante has to go on — tries to find out on lines 90 or so — how, asks the question about what has been happening to him. What about the evil that there is in the universe? He seems — that’s what he seems to be saying, “according to their different lots, nearer to the source and farther from it; they move, therefore, to different ports over the great sea of being, each with an instinct given to it to bear it on: this bears fire up towards the Moon,” by the way, this is really the passage — Dante’s rewriting a passage from Augustine’s , “this is the motive force in mortal creatures, this binds the earth together and makes it one. ”In other words, within the description of the order of the cosmos, Beatrice goes on to say that human beings are the odd figures, that we, somehow, have the power to deviate from this pattern of order. According to the principle, more or less, the rarity and density? The waters I take were never sailed before. The reason it’s dangerous is because he is traveling over water that leaves no wake behind it. Then finally, this allusion to Jason; so he’s not like — Ulysses is like the hero of the Argonauts, who has gone looking for the golden fleece. Yeah, that which — the idea — it’s the idea that you find in the , that why do philosophers — well I’m sure that it’s literally true that there is nothing better for a great philosophical conversation than a glass of wine, and you sit around and you talk, but it clearly is — it’s the food of the mind, the food of knowledge, the taste of knowledge, etc., I don’t think he has an empirical audience in mind."
687,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-17,"This lecture deals with  IV, VI and X. At the beginning of  IV, the pilgrim raises two questions to which the remainder of the canto is devoted. The first concerns Piccarda ( III) who was constrained to break her religious vows. The second concerns the arrangement of the souls within the stars. The common thread that emerges from Beatrice’s reply is the relationship between intellect and will. Just as Piccarda’s fate reveals the limitations of the will, the representation of the souls in , a condescension to the pilgrim’s human faculty, as Beatrice explains, reveal the limitations of the intellect. By dramatizing the limitations of both faculties, Dante underscores their interdependence. In  VI, Dante turns his attention to politics. Through the emperor Justinian’s account of Roman history, Dante places the antithetical views of Virgil and Augustine in conversation. Key to understanding Dante’s position between these two extremes is the vituperation of contemporary civil strife that follows Justinian’s encomium of the Empire. In  X, the pilgrim enters the Heaven of the Sun, where St. Thomas and St. Bonaventure introduce him to two rings of spirits celebrated for their wisdom. The unlikely presence of Solomon and Siger of Brabant among the first of these concentric rings is discussed as a poetic reflection on the boundaries between knowledge and revelation.","With Canto IV of , we are now in the Heaven of the Moon, which as you know by now is also the heaven of grammar, and I will show you in what way this is the heaven of grammar. It’s somebody else’s will forcing me to do something? So would a hound stand between two does; therefore, if I kept silence, urged equally by my doubts, I neither blame nor commend myself, since it was of necessity. I was silent, but my desire was painted on my face and with it my question, far more warmly than in plain words.” First, then, I shall deal with that which has more poison in it. ”It’s very interesting; first of all, the language of poison that this idea of what is dangerous of the two questions is not the question about the will. Is this a theatrical performance, and why if this is a theatrical, and it is, why should that be a question that has more poison in it? How do the souls show themselves forth to the pilgrim? Dante himself clearly is here legitimizing his own use of metaphor. It makes the Pope a temporal ruler and that is the ultimate degradation of the moral authority, the exercise of moral authority from Dante’s viewpoint. He continues for now; he doesn’t tell us yet, “Thou knowest what it did when borne by the illustrious Romans against Brennus… It brought low the pride of the Arabs, who behind Hannibal passed the Alpine crags from which, Po, thou fallest. You can see he agrees with Augustine and disagrees with Augustine. And when crafty tongues moved him to call to account this just man, who rendered him seven and five for ten, Romeo left there poor and old; and if the world knew the heart he had, begging his bread by morsels, much as it praises him would praise him more. Why in the heaven of logic, let’s say, does he have to talk about history? We move instead to the Heaven of the Sun, she’s a little bit — X, XI and XII are — I don’t know that I’ll be able to finish all of Canto X but I want to start the discussion. You return to what you already knew from a different viewpoint and you see things, things are new. He was the perfect king because he knew what to ask. Lecturing is an activity that implies glossing, just as is the glosseta of Aristotle, but he tells us where he lived, in the Street of Straw in Paris, a street that now is called by the way, the Rue de Voir, but is now called the Rue Dante, knowing that clearly the Parisians are mindful of this passage. You all know that philosophy is always understanding itself as a journey, a method, an exodus, Parmenides, or a quietness of things about the five ways to reach the ultimate truths about God. In Canto IV you have two issues, you have the issue of allegory and the issue of the will where Dante goes on explaining the mode of representation in  as a mode of accommodation to our limited faculty and he thinks that this is really the mode of representation throughout the Bible, the iconography of the Church, the poem, etc., Now there is no question that I think that there is no intrinsic difference between the two modes. Now I’m saying that both of them for Dante have a kind of metaphorical basis and the relationship between the metaphor and truth is, of course, it’s certainly the language of a very similitude, if not absolutely the truth. The question, a very good question, is why does Dante find it so difficult to acknowledge the perfection of Solomon’s intellect, when after all, in  and , we have had some accounts of how the will is moved by the intellect and perfected by the intellect. We believe in the Bible so he’s the wisest, but he was also known as being the most lecherous of kings, so big solution for Dante, forget about that, he’s really the wisest so he’s saved, so that solves that particular issue of the relationship between love and knowledge and I think that’s a crucial point in — for the way you are stating the issue because you are stating how in  and  you have the will directed and reorganized by the intellect, so you see there must be some kind of relationship between will and intellect. But now let me come to the crux of the matter here. It’s the root, the philosopher of the root, philosophy is on the way out of their odyssey, the odyssey of the soul, that’s really — we call it — Dante says exodus, it’s an exodus clearly countering the idea of the philosophical root. It’s — maybe it strikes you as sophistry but I enjoy that."
688,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-18,"Professor Mazzotta continues his discussion of the Heaven of the Sun ( X-IV), where the earthly disputes between the Franciscan and Dominican orders give way to mutual praise. The tribute St. Thomas pays to the founder of the Franciscan order ( XI) is repaid by St. Bonaventure through his homage to St. Dominic ( XII). The chiasmic structure of these cantos is reinforced by the presence of Nathan and Joachim of Flora, the counterweights to Solomon and Siger, among the second ring of sages. Special attention is then paid to the lives St. Francis and St. Dominic presented in  XI and XII, where the former’s marriage to Lady Poverty finds its poetic counterpart in the latter’s marriage to theology. The critique of the world and its values shared by these religious founders is explored in light of the “ludic theology” that pervades these cantos.","Last time we got into Canto X and I began with the Heaven of the Sun, and I began with the description of — Dante begins, we went over the phases of the canto. I think that that is such a remarkable word because it really means “to think” in Latin, and they always exploit this resonance of the verb — means to be at an impasse, to be suspended literally, so he’s suspended in thoughts as if the thoughts could not quite make him reach the threshold of the knowledge he wanted. The Franciscans are those who believe in the priority of will and love in the act of knowledge. He is known, to those who know, as being David’s bad conscience, or good conscience, the one who is pricking him to think about himself. The other figure that I would like to say something about is Nathan the prophet for a very simple reason, because Nathan as you probably know — because it’s very strange, why would Dante include Nathan a prophet among — there’s Joachim of Flora who is prophetic, but why include Nathan among these wise spirits? Nathan becomes a kind of mask for Dante himself. There is already a self-sufficient knowledge that they can acquire. Keep in mind then as we read Canto XI, we are again — I repeat in the Heaven of the Sun and I don’t know that the passage that I read to you from the pseudo Dionysus last time about the divine names where the pseudo Dionysus goes on talking about why is the metaphor of the sun such a fundamental image for the divine generosity. I think this idea of freedom will be the dominant theme of Canto XI. For those who do not know their way at all, have never known the way, they are capable of discovering it. She, bereft of her first husband,” Christ, “despised and obscure eleven hundred years and more, remained without a suitor till he came; nor did it avail when men heard that he who put all the world in fear found her unmoved, with Amyclas, at the sound of his voice; nor did it avail her to have such courage and constancy that, where Mary stayed below, she mounted on the cross with Christ. But, lest I proceed too darkly, take now Francis and Poverty for these lovers in all I have said. That is to say — what I mean to say is that dresses, clothes are part of a social set of values which Francis is flouting and parodying. Even sexuality, which is certainly a value of the world, Francis will turn around. This is not all that Dante will do with Francis this is now — there is one little reference that I want to mention. We have had, and we will have, celebrations of the crusades. There is a further detail that I want to mention here. One, a Hindu world of the Ganges and we shall see what the means for him, and the other one is the Muslim world of the Sultan. Dante is, I think, echoing this text and these problems in the canto of Francis, so he places Francis between the Ganges and Egypt, and places him as the one who is carving a new space, the space that he calls that of poverty meaning freedom, meaning the will, meaning the way of love as a way of coming to the knowledge of God. Here too, there is the — let me just go over with lines 45, “In that part,” that’s the description of the legend of Dominic, the life of Dominic, “In that part where sweet Zephyr rises to open the new leaves in which Europe,” once again see how Dante’s — there is a kind of continental imagination here, the Asia, Africa, and Europe, the three continents “in which Europe sees herself reclad, not far from the beating of the waves behind which the sun, after his long flight, sometimes hides himself from all men, lies favoured Calahorra. In the previous canto, we had Francis, who I said, parodies all the values of the world. He is called — and that has really become a formula to describe both Francis — unless Dominic though, they are the so-called — I’ll give it to you in Latin and translate it. And the mother is, meaning the one who is full of grace Giovanna, the one who comes before is also, if you interpret it properly. Are we supposed to be thinking about Dante having to depend on, I guess, the charity of others? Should we take it literally or just as a poetic way of speaking?"
689,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-19,"This lecture focuses on the cantos of Cacciaguida ( XV-XVII). The pilgrim’s encounter with his great-great grandfather brings to the fore the relationship between history, self and exile. Through his ancestor’s mythology of their native Florence, Dante is shown to move from one historiographic mode to another, from the grandeur of epic to the localism of medieval chronicles. Underlying both is the understanding of history in terms of genealogy reinforced and reproved by Dante’s mythic references to fathers and sons, from Aeneas and Anchises to Phaeton and Apollo to Hippolytus and Theseus. The classical and medieval idea of the self’s relation to history in terms of the spatial continuity these genealogies provide is unsettled by Cacciaguida’s prophecy of Dante’s exile. The very premise of the poem’s composition, exile is redeemed as an alternative means of reentering the world of history.","Last time we looked at the cantos of the sun, which is the canto of arithmetic and so — and we discussed actually the variety of philosophical strengths, theological and philosophical ideas that compose Dante’s circle of knowledge, this encyclopedic compass or what’s worth knowing. You could also look at it from other, many other points of view. As you remember, with the mentioning of the name Dante, then a new phase begins in Dante’s construction, which is more educational, more speculative, which is really the world of .But so, we talk about self and history in a way that maybe Dante’s never quite coupled the two terms before; he does so in Canto XV, XVI, and XVII of . Let me tell you first of all these mythic figures and then we’ll talk about them. You remember when he resists the call to this huge risky enterprise of going through hell that comes to him from Virgil. This becomes a point of reference and this is what I am. I am who I am only because I belong to a larger pattern of history. This is another way, still another way of understanding history. ”This is Cacciaguida who announces the exile as the fatality that is hovering over Dante and for which he has to prepare himself and exile — you see what it implies also a sort of necessary detachment from one’s family, one’s country, one’s whole — all the possible lines that tend to join us and limit us too. How does the self enter the world of history? That text is about the question of how the self is related to history and Dante disagrees with Augustine. There is no other way, Dante says, for the self to exist if not by measuring oneself with the historical, the pressures of historical realities, but my own relationship to it is not that — or that of belonging as Aeneas does into the world of history with feeling that I am — the political world is going to be my way out of this maze. I think that we have to reread now the three cantos in some detail and we come up with an answer. How often Dante’s punning with the metaphor of wings; in Italian it’s , Alighieri, Aligher, that was the name, the bearers of wings so the — for instance line 52, “I speak of thee, thanks to her who clad thee with wings for the lofty flight,” or a little later on line 70, “I turned to Beatrice, and she heard before I spoke and smiled to me, a sign that made the wings grow on my will,” and later line 80 many, many times. In Canto XVI this myth of — there’s also this golden age of Florence, there’s this illusion that it abode in peace, they lived in peace, whenever I hear the language of peace I do hear, I do overhear the echo of Jerusalem, the city of peace, and that’s what makes it interesting, so it’s a typology of another city, a golden — the great time, the golden age of the past is a kind of — what the prophets would always recall as the peace time of Jerusalem that they had — that the Jews themselves had lost and kept on commemorating in the history. The place where you can find these modalities of history is really Boethius, who writes the , at the center of which he figures the Wheel of Fortune. First of all he called the mixture, , is the other name for Babylon. The two myths of the cities are not antithetical; they are both possible within the same body politic. This is no longer the perspective of the chronicler, it’s the perspective of Dante as the poet; so it’s a critique of the inadequacy of the chronicle’s view of what history could be. The language with which Dante presents the world to come for him, the future, this is his future, it’s not the past, history then is understood as above all futurity. Anyway, “ ‘Thy first refuge and inn thou shalt find in the courtesy of the great Lombard,” this is the gentleman of Verona, the one gentleman of Verona who houses him and hosted him for a while, “who bears on the ladder the sacred bird, and he will hold thee in so gracious regard that, of doing and asking between you two, that shall be first which with others come after. These are the snares that are hid behind a few revolving years; yet I would not have thee envious of thy fellow-citizens, for thy life shall far outlast the punishment of the perfidies. The word translates, of course, prudence. The only difference is that if there is any christological resonance here it very quickly fades because Dante’s really discussing himself as an exile with this — and he understands exile as the real condition of himself but also of human beings. That is a decisive moment in — clearly in his life and his understanding of himself. Not Dante, so that’s really the direct answer I can give to your question."
690,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-1,"Professor Mazzotta introduces students to the general scheme and scope of the  and to the life of its author. Various genres to which the poem belongs (romance, epic, vision) are indicated, and special attention is given to its place within the encyclopedic tradition. The poem is then situated historically through an overview of Dante’s early poetic and political careers and the circumstances that led to his exile. Professor Mazzotta concludes by discussing the central role Dante’s exile was to play in his poetic project.","I’m going to give a short class, what is known a short class, they call it — it’s an old idea. It really means this, as I said, the circle of knowledge, in the sense that to know you have to have a point of departure. And that the point of departure will take you along all the various disciplines of the so-called liberal arts, and then they take you right back to where you started. We talk of — Dante raises some of these issues in a very lucid, and I think, a most probing manner possible. Brunetto Latini would call him — he’s still talked about — if you happen to go to Florence and you read this kind of memorial stones that are all — are everywhere on the walls of the city, he was one of those who civilized the city of Florence. We’ll talk about some of the details about this. The is the story of exile being the removal of oneself from the city; in order to best see what the problems of cities can be. How important is the knowledge of the Italian language? After all, as someone says, Dante’s an American poet, maybe we could explore that too."
691,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-20,"In this lecture, Professor Mazzotta examines  XVIII-XIX and XXI-XXII. In  XVIII, Dante enters the Heaven of Jupiter, where the souls of righteous rulers assume the form of an eagle, the emblem of the Roman Empire. The Eagle’s outcry against the wickedness of Christian kings leads Dante to probe the boundaries of divine justice by looking beyond the confines of Christian Europe. By contrasting the political with the moral boundaries that distinguish one culture from another, Dante opens up the Christian economy of redemption to medieval notions of alterity. In XXI, Dante moves from the exemplars of the active life to the contemplative spirits of the Heaven of Saturn, Peter Damian and St. Benedict. The question of perspective through which the theme of justice was explored resurfaces to distinguish between the visionary claims of the contemplative and mystical traditions. As Dante ascends to the Heaven of the Fixed Stars, catching sight of the earth below ( XXII), his own visionary claims are distinguished by an awareness of his place in history.","I realize that as we read from assignment to assignment, and partly because we read in a very selective way, I know there are a lot of gaps in our readings. That was the final prophecy of Cacciaguida. I am an exile, I do not belong anywhere, what is — how do we understand here and how do we understand there? In this canto Dante discusses primarily justice. Then Dante goes on describing a metamorphosis, how “in the  of the fifth word they kept their order, so that Jupiter seemed there silver pricked out with gold; and I saw other lights descend on the very summit of the  and settle there, singing, I think, of the good that draws them to itself. It comes from geometry because it implies a turning. It’s one turning, it’s the sphere, you can have hemispheres but the two hemispheres make the universe. Those who do not have excess or exceed or want to exceed to Revelations. And, for earnest of this, all men shall know that Nicosia and Famagosta lament and complain of their own beast, which keeps its place beside the rest. What is not out of the economy of redemption? This is exactly the question that Dante asks and the answer is that we do not know. We do not know how this salvation is going to work out. We don’t really believe what we hear, but what we see is direct and we want to have access to it. He has been living decorously and rationally, why should he be not saved? This is the minutes that are just taken in. And that judgment which holds it for least, I approve as best, and he whose thought is on the other things may rightly be called just. ”We have an astronomy here, the heaven of astronomy, but we have an astronomy which is indicated mythically, and not only mythically but also through a process of affiliation; it’s the daughter of Latonia, the son of Hyperion, a process of affiliation, it’s really as if the universe itself has followed the logic of generation of production as being — producing and reproducing itself and then he continues, Dante goes back to looking at the Earth. “ This idea of the Twins being the sign under which he was born, it doesn’t really imply any astrological lapse on his part, it’s now that he can be free and he has determined the limitations of — astrological determinations he can go on alluding to his birth sign. I want to draw — I just want to draw the attention to this whole point about the “ci” where Dante says “the little threshing-floor that makes us so fierce,” because for all its distance, Dante says, distance as it can be — for all the distance which is implied by this poetic fiction, he’s distant from the Earth as he ever was. Set thy mind behind thine eyes and make of them mirrors to the shape which in this mirror will appear to thee. That would seem to be, of course, an extraordinary spiritual story. In fact, he shows himself and she cannot bear the extraordinary beauty of the god and gets destroyed and turned into ashes. This is an extraordinary passage in terms of what Dante thinks of contemplation and clearly the danger of thinking of contemplation as the condition that would allow and bring about the vision of God. Such a vision, Dante is saying, is not going to be possible while we are here on Earth. You do have the language of playfulness in the forms of simulations. The image of Beatrice as Semele, whose smile could potentially destroy the lover, the pilgrim who were to look at her face; the question is, is that supposed to be a sort of, let’s call it palinodic variant, a version of the scene of Medusa in  IX, who threatened also, in that case the pilgrim, with petrification, with a turning into stone, the intellect would petrify, that’s really the allegory and there of course in the canto of Medusa there was always the shield, the shield of poetry, the shield of Perseus, and the answer is yes absolutely, this is exactly what is happening."
692,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-21,"This lecture covers  XXIV-XXVI. In the Heaven of the Fixed Stars, Dante is examined on the three theological virtues by the apostles associated with each: St. Peter with faith ( XXIV), St. James with hope ( XXV), and St. John with love ( XXVI). While mastering these virtues is irrelevant to the elect, it is crucial to the message of reform the pilgrim-turned-poet will relay on his return home. Dante’s scholastic profession of faith before St. Peter ( XXIV) is read testament to the complication of faith and reason. The second of the theological virtues is discussed in light of the classical disparagement of hope as a form of self-deception and its redemption by the biblical tradition through the story of Exodus, the archetype of Dante’s journey. The pilgrim’s three-part examination continues in XXVI under the auspices of St. John, where love, the greatest of the virtues is distinguished by its elusiveness. The emphasis on love’s resistance to formal definition sets the stage for the pilgrim’s encounter with Adam, who sheds light on the linguistic consequences of the Fall.","Today we are going to look at the three cantos in the eighth sphere of Dante’s cosmos; we are beyond the planets, beyond all this so called eighth sphere, or the Heaven of the Fixed Stars. Dante is a bachelor who presents himself to the teacher, the teacher is testing him, and he will give an answer according to textbooks. That to me is part of the shared world, this eschatological banquet, where they’re all the — the vision where, at the end of time, but the allusion is also to the  where these various figures are — the community comes together and then Dante goes on really focusing on the individuality, on the private professional faith, it’s really about him. The teacher is not necessarily worthy of faith. The one — or the authority, the one who is an author is one who is worthy of belief, worthy of faith, so he quotes Paul, so this is a canonical answer, “ ‘As the truthful pen of thy dear brother,” Paul, “wrote of it with thee, father, put Rome on the good path, faith is the substance,” literally the foundation, that which lies under all the things. This is the sense of the whole metaphorical pattern of the university context. It really means, I think, at a deeper level, that faith itself is a mode of knowledge. I didn’t mean they’re identical; the joining of philosophy and theology, reason and faith, makes and projects faith as a way of knowing. So this seems to be the argument and I set the terms against, let’s say, a modern subjective idea of freedom, freedom of faith as freedom, that frees you from all, and you are only accountable to the Creator, or faith as a mode of responding to the absurdity around oneself, which is really the language of Tertullian and this scholastic argument that Aquinas, of knowledge and faith really needing to be together. On which is based the lofty hope; and therefore it takes the character of substance. Fourth, I cannot really get past my mind that Dante wants us to think about this kind of the resonance of prophenation that is in the language of money and link it with really this purity of faith. This is a different understanding of time that Dante presents. I’m sorry that I’m giving you this kind of simple paraphrase of it, but the ascesis of writing, writing is a — do you understand what I mean? It is as if literally faith, and hope are now converging, the two virtues come together. For those of you who have no inkling of what this is it’s the — what we call the sacramental, the typological, if you really — more textual and historical about that sacrament, that ceremony, re-enactment of Exodus. It is as if he were saying that the poet can only come home in order to tell his community that I have to get out again. Adam changes Dante — through Adam is changing the account he had given in the , which is a story about the origin of words, of language, and where he had claimed that Hebrew persists; Adam’s language unchanged through history because it was inconceivable, he adds there, that Jesus would be using a language other than the primal language and not the corrupt language of human beings. The question is, a question that I really welcome, and I was hoping someone would ask. You may remember that Virgil goes out of the way to speak — be the one who is the interlocutor of Ulysses and supposedly to speak Greek, in Canto XXVI of , Dante uses the Provencal language of Arnault Daniel who now starts speaking in Provencal, and then now we are using — Dante’s using the foreign language, Hebrew, the names of God, so it’s — that’s one connection, so there are a lot of other, of these connections. From this point of view this is — there seems to be a contrast between Ulysses’ form of knowledge and Adam’s form of knowledge. In the case of Adam, getting to know of the fruit of the tree was not an issue. How are we to understand the loss of boundary? Well, Dante has a number of references throughout  to the Trinity. You have an idea in your mind, you emit a sound, but to emit the sound you need the breath, and you cannot have the sound without the breath, and you cannot have the sound without the idea, so that speaking encompasses this three-fold components of one. From what you said in answer to the other question, it seems like you were saying that if Dante takes the fall it’s good enough because it leads to self-knowledge. I understand how it’s different from — Adam is different from Ulysses in that he is trying to go somewhere, like he’s trying to become more like God and that’s good because it’s a definite end, but it still seems that if the means of trying to achieve that end is wrong."
693,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-22,"This lecture focuses on  XXVII-XXIX. St. Peter’s invective against the papacy from the Heaven of the Fixed Stars is juxtaposed with Dante’s portrayal of its contemporary incumbent, Boniface VIII, in the corresponding canto of . Recalls of infernal characters proliferate as the pilgrim ascends with Beatrice into the . Bid to look back on the world below, Dante perceives the mad track of his uneasy archetype, Ulysses. Dante’s remembrance of this tragic shipwreck at the very boundary of time and space gains interest in light of his allusion to Francesca at the outset of XXIX. These resonances of intellectual and erotic transgression reinforce the convergence of cosmology and creation Dante assigns to the heaven of metaphysics","We’re going to look at XXVII, XXVIII and XXIX today of , three cantos that, really, I think, Dante constructs together and where Dante puts forth this theory of creation and cosmology which are not quite the same thing. That’s the way it says, so the canto literally looks backwards and a parallel with — you may have a number of parallels with  XIX where Dante meets, you remember, the popes who are turned upside down and the flames — the kind of — the parody of the Pentecostal fires out on the plants of their feet, but this is more clearly a reference to Canto XXVII of , where this is the very beginning, this is — there is a hymn Canto XXVII, “Glory be to the Father, the Son, etc.,” Ulysses only went past the Pillars of Hercules; he, Dante, is now at the outer most boundary of the visible physical universe, so there’s a way in which there is a little bit of detachment and yet a constant fascination. We tried to explain why he is so fascinated with Ulysses. They would say that was — metaphysics was called metaphysics because it — the book was placed on the shelf a little bit after the book on physics. This is a way of trying to explore, to enter, mystically enter, the mind of God. This would be the — pass it around here and then I’ll explain — they’re all spirals really like the — since Dante thinks of the cosmos as a book and we would call it a cosmobook, that’s a neology that I coin here, a kind of cosmobook. This is the first description that she’s giving. We are in the shadow of the tree of time. Now it continues with, XXVIII deals with the angelic hierarchy. He sees a universe which is adjacent to the physical universe with — inhabited by angels. This is what he is saying, when the two children of Latona, the Sun or Apollo and the Moon, Diana, along the horizon, they seem to be aligned together and they are held together by the zenith. I take this to be a sexual language as it can be found, a new love engendered, opened itself into new loves. In the physics, this is an allusion to Aristotle’s physics, where Aristotle has to define time; he says it’s the measure, we speak of time when there is a before and an after, because this is really what time is. It could not be distinguished before in terms of time, there was no such a thing as before and after, and then he goes on just to continue with this sexual metaphor, “Form and matter, united and separate, came into being that had no defect, like three arrows from a three-stringed bow. This is the context of what she is saying, before and after. If the universe is eternal you have no differences inside it. Why evoke those two images?I wish we could — I have to keep that hanging awhile so it can become a little bit more compelling what I’m going to tell you. I’m not going to read it, I’m not going to ask you to read, I’m only going to ask you to look, I won’t read it though. It could also be philosophically repudiated. Why they’re brought up — how they fit into that explanation? Now he probably realizes how different he is from Ulysses because Ulysses went to — he’s implying how risky his own enterprise may be which we have seen before. How do I make things cohere?Of course it’s possible to think — one way of thinking of  and the joy of the blessed is to go on thinking that my joy — suppose that I were saved, a very unlikely proposition. I think that by the allusion to them he’s also saying that here on earth you can grant me that, that’s what I said before, and I think that I’m not pushing it to the point of unbelievability. I can push it to the point of absurdity, to say look maybe if this is true, he’s also saying not only that they in a shadowy way, in a dim way, were anticipating the real happiness in the sinful modes, the sinners, but that maybe they too if you move out of this text — as you know this is not said in the text that they too will be — are going to be taken and placed into the bosom of Abraham where all the blessed dwell. The term he uses is , from the Italian, in Italian we call it , very close to in English we have the word April, by the way, as an opening of spring. It is also a theory of creation and it’s the theory of creation that has unpredictable possibilities."
694,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-23,"Professor Mazzotta lectures on the final cantos of  (XXX-XXXIII). The pilgrim’s journey through the physical world comes to an end with his ascent into the Empyrean, a heaven of pure light beyond time and space. Beatrice welcomes Dante into the Heavenly Jerusalem, where the elect are assembled in a celestial rose. By describing the Empyrean as both a garden and a city, Dante recalls the poles of his own pilgrimage while dissolving the classical divide between  and , between civic life and pastoral retreat. Beatrice’s invective against the enemies of empire from the spiritual realm of the celestial rose attests to the strength of Dante’s political vision throughout his journey into God. Dante’s concern with the harmony of oppositions as he approaches the beatific vision is crystallized in the prayer to the Virgin Mary offered by St. Bernard, Dante’s third and final guide. In his account of the vision that follows, the end of Dante’s pilgrimage and the measure of its success converge in the poet’s admission of defeat in describing the face of God.","You may recall that last time we went over the shape of Dante’s cosmos, remember. This is the end of the race for him; it’s the end of the journey. It’s not a mystical proposition that he advances; it’s actually the way of justifying his poem and we’ll come to that in some detail in — when we come to Canto XXXIII.What I would emphasize, though, to move now to Canto XXX, Dante’s entering into the Heavenly Jerusalem which is a garden and it’s a city. And if the lowest rank,” that’s the image of theatre where you have in an auditorium today, tiers, “encloses within it so great a light, what is the expense of this rose in its farthest petals?”The second image is that it’s described — to describe this — the Heavenly Jerusalem is the rose, a white rose, a mystical rose. It has been described a littler earlier as — in terms of a rose and a garden, and now it’s a city, that’s an interesting shift in Dante’s poem. It is a way of encompassing the whole movement of the poem within these two figures. This is — it is as if the whole impulse behind this experience of Dante is a reintegration into what is it he implies. They are not two divergent modes of the ; they really cohere within one. Very few, the implication is, are going to be saved. and then Dante goes on, the other great problem. But had not yet dwelt on any part of it, and I turned with new-kindled eagerness to question my Lady of things in which my mind was in suspense. Two things, therefore, have to be followed from this. The poem begins with — Canto XXXIII begins with a prayer, a prayer to the Virgin Mary, or the Virgin Mother, and it’s going to be constructed through a series of paradoxes as you can see, Virgin Mother, daughter of your son, paradox is about time, paradox is about all sorts of reversals of the natural order, “lowly and exalted more than any creature,” a way of using paradoxes that challenge the rational understanding of the world. See the differences, I and him, “offer to thee all my prayers, and pray that they come not short, that by thy prayers thy wilt disperse for him every cloud of his mortality so that the supreme joy may be disclosed to him. Let thy guardianship control his human impulses. Very soon the language of Dante will change from desire to enjoyment. How are you going to make a failure become a success? How — from the fact that he is not going to be able to see will become somehow a mode of his own, not just a humility because it would be a success in terms of the pilgrim’s own humility, but in terms of the writing of the poem. We long for what we do not have, at least at that moment. ”Now language fails, memory fails; the second failure is that of speech. “ Vision exceeds language, exceeds speech, there is more to the text Dante is saying, there’s more to my experience of the world than what I can say in words. This, to what I saw, is such that it is enough to call it little. But it also means that this line places Dante exactly in  I and this is the story of the poem. You can see the poem as both a journey and the telling of the journey endlessly like the movement of the sun and the other stars. Bernard signed to me with a smile to look upward, but already of myself I was doing what he wished;” that’s fairly, at least literally clear, “for my sight, becoming pure,” that’s also clear, Dante’s experience in the final poems can be reduced to a refinement of the faculty of vision, physical but also clearly spiritual. “ Dante begins with the idea that what we know of the divine is light, a light that — the power of which and the limitation of which is exactly like the dark in the sense that the light reveals to us the divine, but at the same time hides the origin of the light. You may say that some of our imagination is that we are in the dark."
695,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-24,"The last class of the semester consists of a brief recapitulation of topics in the  addressed throughout the course, followed by an extensive question and answer session with the students. The questions posed allow Professor Mazzotta to elaborate on issues raised over the course of the semester, from Dante’s place within the medieval love tradition to the relationship between his roles as poet and theologian.","Here we are, talking about — recapitulating the work done on — in reading part of the poem, selections of this poem. The itself has a sort of inconclusive quality about it. I think there is a mode of recapitulation, this is what I have to — I will have to briefly illustrate and give you the chance to ask more questions specifically about the poem. Around this extraordinary concern of freedom, and therefore the possibilities of the moral life, we came to the conclusion of  with a garden, the Garden of Eden, the place of pleasures, the place where pleasures are not damned in and of themselves. Why is it a special mode of theologizing? The second thing that I think that we have learned to understand about this theology of Dante is freedom. That’s really — so it’s tied with freedom. I’m interested in faith as a form of freedom because that frees me from all loyalties. I don’t want to have any loyalties or accept anything that I don’t even see. These are some of the issues that Dante has. The other day, yesterday, the day before I was asked the question about one line in Dante and I was very — it was a very good question about the fact that Dante’s allowed to see the truth, that the light he saw was the truth. First of all, the prayer to the Virgin is all about longing, this state of longing but not languishing. That is to say, it’s not a poem about the past, Dante is the least nostalgic of poets, it’s so easy, if you really go wherever and you tell your grandchildren you read Dante. Dante doesn’t really care whether we are reading him or not. It really means that it always — it will come to an end either in death, in nothingness; finally you renounce all desire which is the death of desire or some idea of the absolute of God. Now then you asked me to talk about the  and the uneasiness you had. He wants to — the story of the  is the story of a poet who knows — he doesn’t know Beatrice, he calls her Beatrice only because in the nearness of her he would feel beatitudes; that’s what he says, so there’s a kind of arbitrariness to names. That’s not what a virtuous man should be doing. Don’t hope marriage because that’s a serious business concerning property, and wealth, and status so within the fairly close boundaries of the courtly love tradition, then you go on making such assumptions about yourself about — you can play about the greatness of women, the secret of love, there’s a certain code. France is Benedict, Dominic, Bernard and so in spite of the fact that he’s a contemplative, Bernard did not hesitate to write a text for the spiritual edification of his ex-disciple, Eugene the IV, who is now a Pope and he’s aware how the office of the shepherd of the church can distract him from the loftier spiritual aims and the longings, so it’s really a sequence of arguments about what you should — how should you administer your time so that you are never really going to lose sight of what your true aim is, Heaven. Now, you see it clearly another way in which I can understand your question is that you see some kind of divergence, some sort of break. On the one hand this kind of invective, the mode of the invective in Dante when talking about Peter, St. Peter in  XXVII. I mean, he doesn’t — he looks back after the examination on faith, he looks back and he starts attacking what he takes to be the use of patience, my place; remember that, an incredibly moral voice that rises right at the very end. They don’t need to have Daniel give an interpretation; Ezekiel has visions, but Isaiah doesn’t have visions so it’s — you see what I’m saying? There is no clear-cut distinction between the prophetic and the mystical, certainly not in Dante. When Dante goes on listing, in the mystical rose, we even are told that Beatrice sits next to Rachel. Then I added, after saying that this a Roman concern, because it’s the whole — it’s tied to the notion of foundation. I can love, from Paolo and Francesca, and yet that engenders a lot of violence. Dante has gone through all the phases for this sort of thinking."
696,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-2,"This lecture is devoted to the , Dante’s autobiographical account of his “double apprenticeship” in poetry and love. The poet’s love for Beatrice is explored as the catalyst for his search for a new poetic voice. Medieval theories of love and the diverse poetics they inspired are discussed in contrast. The novelty of the poet’s final resolution is tied to the relationship he discovers between love and knowledge. This relationship is then placed in its larger cultural context to highlight the ’s anticipation of the .","Today we’ll be discussing, and a little bit in haste of course, because I haven’t got much time to do this, but we’ll devote the whole class to the  or , as it is called which is Dante’s first work. This is — there is a kind of suspension about it, but this is the first work, let’s call it, full work, that Dante writes. and then he ends up having a final vision. As an autobiography, though, the text echoes, and is modeled on, the most important autobiography written in the Middle Ages. I look back at my life and try to figure out what are the stages, what are the events, what is it that makes me now the person that I am. He certainly knows that memories of the mother, as you know of the Muses, this is the famous myth, right? And that’s the problem he has, that one of the crises that he has is that he’s always waiting for words to come to him, he’s always waiting for Beatrice to say hello to him, there is a way in which he casts himself as the passive, a passive protagonist, weak-willed, unable, believing that the will can direct him wherever the will wants and that’s another problem that we are really going to talk about. After I wrote this sonnet there came to me a miraculous vision in which I saw things,” like a visionary burden of the narrative is kept up from memory now to vision, “that made me resolve to say no more about this blessed one…” “Blessed” in Italian, by the way is a pun on the name of Beatrice, the one who is blessed, the one who is the bearer of the good, now that’s really what it means — ;”… until I will be capable of writing about her in a nobler way.” We began by saying, I began by saying that the mode, the rhetorical mode that Dante really follows is Augustine’s  which is a text of retrospection and ends with a commentary of Genesis, Dante ends with what we call a prolepsis, a weird word that’s not so weird, but all that means, a projection to the future; autobiography has this kind of future dimension and cannot be contained. This could be viewed as one of the many love books of the Middle Ages, and in case some of you may be looking already for a topic for your paper, you could write about the love books of the Middle Ages. The Greeks tried to do that and you may remember Socrates who always wonders what love is. It’s — that’s just a useless figure of love. Yet, nothing that he does is that this figure of love is a god, really a literary conceit."
697,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-3,"Professor Mazzotta introduces students to the , focusing on the first four cantos of . Stylistic, thematic and formal features of the poem are discussed in the context of its original title, . The first canto is read to establish the double voice of the poet-pilgrim and to contrast the immanent journey with those described by Dante’s literary precursors. Among these is the pilgrim’s guide, Virgil. The following cantos are read with special attention to the ways in which Dante positions his poem vis-à-vis the classical tradition. The novelty of Dante’s otherworldly journey is here addressed in terms of the relationship, introduced in the previous lecture in the context of the , between love and knowledge or, more precisely, between their respective faculties, will and intellect.","Let me say a few things about the poem in general, the structure of the poem, the formal structure, and then we get into the cantos I, II, III, IV which have been assigned to you. You know what the theory of styles is coming to us from ancient Greece and Rome. That which is low and humble, such as the experience he is describing, his own experience — an ordinary human being of living around the year 1300 who manages to have this extraordinary experience of going up to see the face of God and come back — to return — come back to the earth to tell us about it. Number 3 once again is the fundamental symbolic number of division within this text. It can be done, Canto X, X and X, it can be done in a fairly systematic way. Those of you who have a different translation will nonetheless get the gist and the changes, the shifts are really minimal. So bitter it is that death is hardly more. Dante will find out very quickly that that is a false promise; that in many ways, there are realities and that his own realities are going to be a little bit more complex than what one can find in books, manuals of philosophy, about how we get saved and how we can save ourselves. The real journey that he has to undertake is the journey of mind and body, and the body stands for the irreducible historicity of one’s self. Last time, talking about the , I began mentioning to you that the will is even better of course for him than unwilling, and yet the best experiences of life seem to be those of one does not want to happen to us; such as a dream, for instance, the dream of falling in love or sometimes in the death of the beloved. He finds out that he cannot go up the hill that he has seen. Look at what — we can stop a little bit to reflect on what this experience here has been like and can we define it in some ways. First meeting then is with this figure by the name of Virgil, who will become his guide. We’ll talk a lot about it; I hope you’ve been reading that poem, if you haven’t already. I could give you names if you wish: Bernard Sylvester, Fulgentius a little bit earlier, John of Salisbury who was an Englishmen of the twelfth century, who will go on writing about the is the story of a hero who is born in Troy and then goes through the stages of life. It’s not — you find yourself lost, what do you do? Not without irony, not without discouragement, not without a sense that this may indeed be a proud arrogant kind sort of posture. I can’t go past it, some of the difficulties. We might not be the same leaves, but leaves very much like those that have just fallen will return. “As in autumn, the leaves drop off one after the other until the branch sees all its spoils on the ground, so the  seed of Adam,” we — there is already some kind of — some evil being acknowledged at the root of our own existence, “the  seed of Adam, fling themselves from the shore one by one at the signal, as a falcon at its recall. Margaret, are you grieving of a Goldengrove unleaving? And he meets a lot — it’s described as a garden, one of the gardens, one of the three, four gardens we find a sort of pre-figuration of the — in many ways of the earthly paradise and gardens in Purgatory, but it’s also pre-figuration of the world of Paradise where the city, Jerusalem, is described as a garden. There is the shade; there is the fragrance of the landscape, this is the way that we’re — the wherewithal, the description of these bucolic gardens, that’s exactly when the snake will appear. Dante here, arrives and he sees the poets, Canto IV, it’s an extraordinary — they’re all virtuous heathens, he sees the poets, and the great poets that he will see — the first poets that he will see are — first of all he sees all the figures from — he will enumerate the characters, scientists, philosophers from the Greek and Roman world, but put a little bit at the edge. He that comes next is Horace, the moralist. Thus, we went on as far as the light, talking of things which were fitting for that place and of which it is well now to be silent. You have to pull together things that don’t seem to be described. We are going to go on next time thinking about this whole question of reading and responsibilities of writing. For a while he was a Guelf being thrown out of Florence with many others, also as an act of punishment for a decision he had made to throw out the Ghibellines, among whom his own best friend, Guido Cavalcanti, who died in exile. I mean the — it clearly is an issue related to love, fundamentally related to love. But to believe and I’m really — probably have confused some of you here, but don’t be confused, to believe that Dante’s judgment of Francesca is limited to the representation of Canto V, where he describes the relationship between lust and love, lust and love, would be a grand mistake. This is what I was saying today about the fact that the journey is not only just an intellectual journey. Let me also say that Dante goes on thinking about Francesca. I don’t think it’s only lust and that is part of — there’s something even larger about her."
698,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-4,"This lecture examines  IV -VII. Dante’s Limbo, modeled on the classical , is identified as a place of repose and vulnerability. Here, in fact, among the poets of antiquity, the pilgrim falls prey to poetic hubris by joining in their ranks. The pilgrim is faced with the consequences of his poetic vocation when he descends to the circle of lust ( V), where Francesca da Rimini, in her failure to distinguish  from reality, testifies to the dangers inherent to the act of reading. From the destructive power of lust within the private world of the court, Dante moves on to the effects of its sister sin, gluttony, on the public sphere of the city. The relationship posited in  VI between Ciacco and his native Florence is read as a critique of the “body politic.” In conclusion, Virgil’s discourse on Fortune in the circle of avarice and prodigality ( VII) is situated within the Christian world of divine providence.","Last time I finished — we finished on a little note, as you’ll recall, that the detail of the garden where the pilgrim finds himself and meets the other poets. Dante experiences a danger, the danger he experience is that of a poetic hubris. What is the distribution of sins and sinfulness? This is where we are in the area of incontinence, the first one is lust, or what Dante will call with a formula: it’s the area of the sinners who have inverted the order, the hierarchical order of the reason and the will. They have made pleasure — they have invested pleasure with supreme lordship over the order of rationality. Where does pleasure — what is the place of pleasure in the economy of the city?Let’s see who they are, one is the “Empress of peoples of many tongues, who’s so corrupted by licentious vice that she made lust lawful in her law to take away the scandal into which she was brought.” You already start seeing the antagonism between the two of them. And for him this is true in the, but it’s especially true in  where he juxtaposes the earthly city, Rome to the heavenly city, the heavenly Jerusalem. The two cities are opposed to each other. There he reflects on Rome as a city based on lust for power, and from that point of view, really not different from any other empires. The point here is that Dante goes on reflecting — it could become a paper topic for some of you enterprising spirits, for some of you maybe — on the relationship within pity and justice. Now she talks about her city, in terms that clearly contrast with this movement of the souls caught in the storm. Where the Po, with the streams adjoin it, descends to rest.” The first line “Love which,” the translation is, “Love which absolves no — love which is quickly kindled in the gentle heart,” and you know that this is really a quotation from one of Dante’s sonnets in the  that you read, Chapter XX. “ The second image, but love that does not allow anyone who loves from returning, reciprocating the love, it really comes from the so-called ruse of love that Marie de Champagne dictates in Book III of   and I want to read this. What she is doing is abdicating the power of her will to the irresistible, omnipotent, presence of this love. You understand what I mean — how in romances you always have filters of love. We read one day for pastime of Lancelot, how love constrained him. This is clearly, she reads, they read — he says that when one day they were reading for delight, that’s probably part of the concerns that Dante has. Lancelot is the secret lover of the queen; clearly out of the desire and that says something about the nature of desire, to really supplant the king, Arthur. Whatever Dante has found out about passion, about desire, about this in the world of appetites and whatever he has decided about himself and the meaning that this may have for him as a poet, and that scene of fainting at the end, he will go on — this will become the premise for other concerns raised in Canto VI, which as you know, is a political canto. The metaphor of mind appears throughout Canto VI. There’s no necessary connection between the three heads. ”Okay here I have to stop a little bit to tell you what — something that you already caught of course, what the basic metaphor, what the basic conceit is in this canto, and it’s the conceit of the city and the body. But it really goes back to a historian of the classical world that Dante absolutely loves. There’s another little issue here that is being raised and that I want to talk about before the end of the hour: the question of civil war and what Dante understands by civil war because Dante’s political thought, the reality of his political thinking is always the civil war. I would still learn from thee and I beg thee to grant me further speech. They achieved so much worth, so set on well-doing in the city and the English cannot quite render the ambiguity of the Italian. A fire, he says, goes up out of its own specific weight. What I have been explaining to you and I will stop because I want to talk about something else before we go, Canto VII. We are always though on the — precariously poised on this — on the curve. There is still a fallen world and that’s how perception of all the changes that take place."
699,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-5,"In this lecture, Professor Mazzotta discusses  IX-XI. An impasse at the entrance to the City of Dis marks Virgil’s first failure in his role as guide ( IX). The invocation of Medusa by the harpies that descend while they wait for divine aid elicits Dante’s first address to the reader. The question of literary mediation, posed in the previous lecture in the context of  V, is explored further, and the distinction Dante draws between the “allegory of poets” and the “allegory of theologians” is introduced.  X is read with a view to the uniqueness of the sin it deals with - heresy. The philosophical errors of the shades encountered here, Farinata and Cavalcante, are tied to the political turmoil they prophecy for Florence. From the disorder of the earthly city, Dante moves on to the order on its infernal counterpart, mapped by Virgil in  XI. The moral system of Dante’s Hell is then discussed with a view to its classical antecedents.","Today we are going to look at three cantos. Three Furies, the so-called three Erinyes of Greek mythology: Alecto, Tesiphone, and Megaera. A threat of petrifaction, because according to the myth, and if you don’t know all of it for instance, you may have seen a movie about the Medusa, if you look at the — if you gaze at the face of the Medusa, one who gazes at the head of the Medusa who was a great virginal beauty, a vestal in the Temple of Neptune, according to the myth. We have to read, and the language is the language of allegory. Whenever you read the, probably much more than I would ever do, other scholars will tell you that the is a vision, which it is, and that it’s allegorical which at times it is, and the allegory is supposed to explain everything that the pilgrim finds himself lost in the woods. How can I go on drawing a particular significance, or more than one significance out of a statement?He distinguishes two types of allegory. And actually he goes on saying, really, the difference is in how you take the literal sense. You cannot really understand it on your own, so you have to trust my words. As you know, a book that Dante knew very well. You need really the southern climes for that kind of thing, forgetting that the fig tree is always in the Bible. Alypius will rejoin him in Rome, and they go on from there, eventually going to Milan. Bold rather than resolute, and the weaker in that it had presumed on itself which ought to have relied on Thee for so soon the — ” the whole confession is addressed to God, for it’s a confession, a witnessing to God so in case you are confused about the references. He appears from the navel up in the tomb. There are two — this is the really — of the story of a man who doesn’t believe in the Resurrection, and iconographically Dante will go on focusing, insisting on this — on the counter. That’s — Dante uses the past preterite, “he held.” Strikes not the sweet light on his eyes?’ What is this story of political disarray of Florence? Guido went into exile and never made it back. He won’t talk about it openly about the — what had been happening between them. We live like animals more often than not: we eat, we drink, we sleep and so on. At that point we no longer really live we are just — we are abstracted from ourselves, we are removed from ourselves. This is really what I think the double focus of this canto: love and politics and the connection between them. To the disorder of the city, we are now going to have a reflection, a rational reflection on the order that sustains the City of Hell. Dante sees the conjunction of will and, at the same time, the order of reason in the performance of that evil. By these two, if you recall to mind , near the beginning,” the biblical book of Genesis, “it behoves mankind to gain their livelihood and their advancement, and because the usurer takes another way he despises nature, both in herself and in her follower, setting his hope elsewhere. He acknowledges his discipleship to Virgil, which he does all the time, but it implies the educational aspect of art, in the most etymological sense of the term. Dante sees a connection between them, to finally an idea of art. Then that makes sense, but then does he ever really try and explain to them — I mean everyone wonders about the virtuous paintings and why they’re there, and it seems that theirs is just a failure of intellect and there’s really no failure of will. They are not just “other” to be rejected, on the contrary. One thing we know is that he comes as far as the Garden of Eden and just as Beatrice is going to arrive then the pilgrim, the lover now, Dante trembles at the idea that here she is, the destination of his journey, and he needs the help of Virgil. These are questions that he will not answer. I will take the second part of your remark to explain also the first part. The answer that I could give is yes, this is — can be seen as Dante’s own confession and the confession and that’s why I read the passage from Augustine, from Augustine’s own : a confession that can also be exemplary to us. And yet, I’m so grateful to you for noticing this. Thank you so much we’ll see you next time."
700,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-6,"This lecture focuses on the middle zone of Inferno, the area of violence ( XII-XVI). Introductory remarks are made on the concentration of hybrid creatures in this area of Hell and followed by a close reading of cantos XIII and XV. The pilgrim’s encounter with Pier delle Vigne ( XIII) is placed in literary context ( III). The questioning of authority staged in this scene resurfaces in the circle of sodomy ( XV), where the pilgrim’s encounter with his teacher, Brunetto Latini, is read as a critique of the humanistic values he embodied.","With Canto XII — from Canto XII to Canto XVI we are still in what is known the middle ground, which is a moral ground: the middle ground of Hell. There are neo-Platonic images — figures of Centaurs, Minotaurs — understood to signify the doubleness of human beings. They’re capable of becoming fully rational or descending into bestiality. In the twelfth century, this is not the case. There are no great figures, no great personalities. And Dante claims, clearly, that there is a teaching that has to allow the sort of the freedom to move, either in the direction of rationality or the freedom, or the choice, to move in its opposite direction. And as you read through the canto, you will see that he puns on both terms of the name. The whole scene recasts an important scene in Book III of the . Because Dante and Virgil think in sharply different ways. Hallow the ground by building an altar and by purifying the ground through fire. Aeneas complies and leaves that place in the knowledge that is not the place assigned to him. “And the good master began to speak to me,” so Virgil intervenes reminding us that this is indeed Book III of the , which by the way, another little detail, Book III of the  is the book of the  Dante draws from the most. This is really the place where one can call home, whatever that may be for him. Therefore, a mild correction of the claims about teaching in Canto XII. I won’t have to write it here on the board, the .You know, it’s a great rhetorical trick: whenever you give a speech, or whatever people speak to you in public, especially, or privately, they will engage in this, a way of capturing your benevolence by telling a story, playing something about their modesty or whatever. “Thou so allurest me with thy gentle speech that I cannot be silent, and let it not burden you if I am beguiled into talk for a little. In Italian, you say rico which really repeats the idea of faith within it. The real sin is that you kick around those who you perceive are below you. It’s not jealousy, you do have the kind of story. These are the various dimensions of the powers of language. So, it’s always an idea, it’s a kind of blindness to the world outside and here Dante’s punning with his “turned the shameless eyes.” “As the flames between Wissant and Bruges, fearing the flood rushing in on them make their bulwark to drive back the sea, and as the Paduans do along the Brenta to protect their towns and castles before the Chiarentana feels the heat, these were made of the same fashion, except that the builder, whoever he was, made them neither so high nor so broad. I’m not saying that he takes it from Dante. It is as if the most — the humblest experience in the city, in Florence, of all the artists and the tailor can only help him — the only thing he can think about as he’s approaching the most sublime of experiences, that’s  XXXIII.And here this most extraordinary story has also the ring of familiarity. And he said to me: ‘If thou follow thy star,” now again an extension of the language, the metaphor, picks up the metaphor of chance, or destiny, a kind of astrology. That Brunetto makes an incredible mistake of believing that Dante’s experience is exactly the replica of his own. In the acknowledgement that Dante gives of Brunetto’s teaching when he says, “for in my memory is fixed and now goes to my heart the dear and kind paternal image of you were many time in the world, you taught me how men makes himself immortal.” Excellent, the question is, is it possible to differentiate within different forms of suicide since Dante — and that’s exactly right, exactly true, Dante would have Lucretia in Limbo; we have Dido in Canto II among the lustful souls; we have Cato in Purgatory, etc., When we sin we usually can say, well, how can it be — I’m going to give you a kind of — I’m going to take a little bit of distance from this whole question. The fact is that whenever we sin, all sins are involved. This suicide is seen as an extension of her lust."
701,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-7,"This lecture deals primarily with Cantos XIX and XXVI of . Simony, the sin punished in  XIX, is situated historically to point out the contiguity of the sacred and the profane and its relevance to the prophetic voice Dante established in this canto. The fine line between prophecy and profanation is shown to resurface in  XXIV and XXV, where the poet falls prey, as did the pilgrim in  IV, to poetic hubris. Once again, the dangers of Dante’s poetic vocation are dramatized in the canto that immediately follows. In  XXVI, Dante’s tragic revision of the journey of Ulysses is shown to offset his own poetic enterprise, while acknowledging its risks.","Last time we looked at Canto XV of , the canto of Brunetto, the teacher of — Dante’s teacher, and the teacher of the Florentines, and we pointed out the rhetoric of the canto. This is an argument now that engages him as a public figure, as it were, indeed, as a prophet. You can, and you see the differences that — between the two of them. The three popes are under whom Dante lived, who are engaged in simony. It is a sin, whereby one can go on in making commerce of sacred things and thereby engaging in blasphemy. “Now must the trumpet sound for you, for your place is in the third pouch. What he is really removing himself from is the charge that his act may appear purely gratuitous. It was also the position that, according to legend, St. Peter wanted for himself. You’re going toward your proper destination. In the presence of this eclipse of authority, he thinks that it is incumbent upon him to go on taking that authority. In other words, made the pope the ruler of a secular domain. Dante’s been going through the realm of the thieves, Canto XXIV and XXV, and he is overwhelmed by the metamorphosis: the form of punishment of these thieves that go on changing form. This is from Canto XXV, lines 90 and following. He describes the — actually reading from lines 80 and following:“As the lizard under the great scourge of the dogdays, passing from hedge to hedge, seems lightening if it crossed the way, so appeared, making for the bellies of the other two, a small fiery serpent, livid and black as a peppercorn; and that part by which we first received our nourishment, it transfixed in one of them, then fell down before him stretched out. He breaks the account, the chronicle of what he has seen, the witnessing since that’s what he is, he’s the witness in all these experiences and that’s what he says: “Let Lucan now be silent with his tales of wretched Sebellus and Nasidius, and let him wait to hear what now comes forth. ”On the face of it, Dante’s saying that the kind of metamorphosis he’s describing really is more horrifying than anything that Ovid, the author of the, who has always guided his metamorphosis by a belief in the bondage, in the bond of — in the solidarity between humans, human beings and the natural world. If you had the illusion of an idyllic relationship among poets, you are disabused at this point. For Dante this is an extraordinary moment for a number of reasons. Ulysses is a mode of being, a possibility of being, for Dante himself. Dante begins with Ulysses who has returned to Ithaca and starts his journeys of exploration all over again. His is the open quest, the road, on open-ended road, and open-ended journey and this is the way Ulysses will think of himself. But the ambiguity of Ulysses is part of the story of Ulysses from the start. The whole point is that he has seen some Florentine thieves, and named even: “Among the thieves… five such citizens of thine that shame for them comes.” “If favoring star or something better have granted me such boon, I may not grudge it to myself.” Now, the first description of the landscape: a somber landscape, “as many as the fireflies which the peasant resting on the hill — in the season when he that lights the world least hides his face from us…” What an extraordinary image, a periphrasis, to talk about the sun, to describe the night, when the sun is hiding, and you’ll see the implications of this metaphor — I hope — in a moment. And as he that was avenged by the bears saw the chariot of Elijah at his departure when the horses reared and rose to heaven, who could not follow it with his eyes so as to see anything but the flame alone like a little cloud mounting up; so each flame moves along the gullet of the ditch, for none shows the theft and every one steals away a sinner. It is as if here is a man who lives in space. ”And now the speech he makes to his own companions. This is the — his is Ulysses’ perception and because you have a noble seed then you do know that you are — there’s a kind of natural determination in his own mind that he will reach, indeed, the noble end. It doesn’t — that doesn’t really make me prudent. Is it possible for Ulysses and Aeneas to represent the dichotomy between Dante the poet and Dante the narrator? That’s — Dante takes that and he says, there’s no closure here, because he rejects the idea of Dante."
702,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-8,"Professor Mazzotta begins this lecture by recapitulating the ambivalent nature of Ulysses’ sin and its relevance to Dante’s poetic project.  XXVII is then read in conjunction with the preceding canto. The antithetical relationship between Dante’s false counselors, Ulysses and Guido da Montefeltro, anchors an overarching discussion of the relationship between rhetoric and politics. The latter half of the lecture is devoted to  XXVIII, where Dante’s preeminent sower of discord, Bertran de Born, introduces the principle of the . The law of retribution that governs Dante’s Inferno is discussed in light of classical and contemporary theories of justice/crime and punishment. In conclusion, the opening of  XXIX is read as a retrospective gloss on the limitations of retributive justice.",": We’ll continue the discussion we left open last time. Remember we are — we were saying a few things about Ulysses. How does Dante find out — how does he want us to know that somehow the promises Ulysses makes to his companions — he wants to lead them to virtue of knowledge — may really be a faulty promise. How does Dante make us aware that this is indeed — there is madness in what Ulysses is trying to accomplish? From this point through it begins with Troy — I’m sorry with Florence — Dante has this apostrophe against the city of Florence: the city of Thebes, that’s what he calls it, spreading its wings as if it were also — as if cities were like heroes, engaged in great flights. There is a reference to Thebes with — through Eteocles and Polyneices. The canto is full of references to cities from this point of view. There is no epic that you can think of which doesn’t think about — it’s not trying to represent the — either the falling cities and the edification of new cities, or for that matter, some locating of a city that could be in a great, grand metaphysical drama. Ulysses is literally placed in the empty ocean away from all responsibilities and all locations, and it is this gratuitousness of his quest that also counts for his being in Hell among the evil counselors. There is a contraction of focus; there’s even a revision of the claims of epic grandeur that we have in Canto XXVI.Dante meets, and he’s the one to become the interlocutor of, Guido da Montefeltro, an extraordinary figure, a political leader, that’s what he was, who then experienced the conversion. You may know it as a place of — the origin of a great musician from there, but a small town near Rome. I want to conquer and destroy the city of Palestrina; you tell me how I am to do this. We’re really dealing with a Machiavellian world of counselors. Machiavelli uses, takes the language I think that Guido will deploy for himself. But since none ever returned alive from this depth, if what I hear is true, I answer thee without fear of infamy. There where big deals are struck, big deals of the destruction of cities, where the pope will ask the secret advice from his counselor. Then the weighty arguments drove me to the point where silence seemed to me the worst offense and I said,” and this is the advice he gives: simple and spectacular in its simplicity, “Father, since thou dost cleanse me from this sin into which I must now fall,” I love the “I must.” Dante is here describing something altogether different, the meeting of Bertran de Born, and look how this scene — this is the end of Canto XXVIII: “I stayed to watch the troop and saw a thing I should fear simply to tell without more proof,” another, the threat of the ineffable once again. Because I parted those so joined I carry my brain, alas, parted from its root in this trunk; thus is observed in me the retribution. Yes, a king has always two bodies, the visible body that one has and also the mystical body of the royalty. So, by dividing the father from the son, Dante has Bertran de Born breaching the unity of the mystical body of the king. The other metaphor that is behind it, which we already saw a little bit — sort of traced, finally traced in the canto of Ciacco in Canto VI of  was the idea of the body politic that you may remember I mentioned to you. I mention this because Canto XXVIII you have a political focus on Rome, or Bertran de Born, breaching the unity of father and son but also reference to Mohammed and I know there are a lot of people who just find this just absolutely odious that Mohammed should be placed, the prophet should be placed here in this area of Inferno. How are we going to determine what is the exact correspondence? Dante knows that a relative of his is in this den of Hell. So the two voices are simultaneously present. The two voices are simultaneously present. That is to say, it’s how you connect yourself, what kind of judgment do you give of what — of the realities that Dante’s representing, that is going to reveal to you yourself: who you are and where you are. There is one great metaphor that Dante will give in Canto, I believe, XIX of  where he goes back again to the question of justice and he talks about justice in terms of the salvation of the Hindus."
703,italian-language-and-literature,ital-310,lecture-9,"The final cantos of  are read with a view to the role of the tragic within Dante’s . Using Dante’s discussion of tragedy in the  as a point of departure, Professor Mazzotta traces the disintegration of language that accompanies the pilgrim’s descent into the pit of Hell, the zone of treachery, from the distorted speech of Nimrod in XXXI to the silence of Satan in  XXXIV. The ultimate triumph of comedy over tragedy is dramatized by the pilgrim’s ascent, by means of Lucifer, onto the shores of Mount Purgatory.","We are going to try to finish with  today and I would like to look at the last Cantos XXX, XXXI, XXXII maybe a little bit, XXXIII for sure, and there are a couple of details in XXXIV.From one point of view, I’ll be talking about Dante’s tragic mode at the bottom of Hell. He really has this idea of a comical vision, even of the divinityand certainly of the cosmos. So it’s really going to be about language and tragedy, in the belief that this is exactly Dante’s insight about what the tragic may be. Then the language is — it’s only human and yet, it’s not human because it’s actually a gift. Hebrew is acknowledged as the primal language and he will even go on so far as to say that Hebrew is never really extinguished by, for instance, either the fall of man, of mankind, or by the building of the Tower of Babel and the whole question of Nimrod. There’s a whole story about who this Nimrod is — the famous biblical giant who built the Tower of Babel, an act which he even — he, Dante, but this is very much in the tradition of the so-called patristic writings — we’ll see as the counter to the descent of the word, or the redemptive event of the word made flesh, is really the counter to this human effort; this ascent in pride of Nimrod to try to bridge the gap between earth and heaven. He talks now about rhetoric and he becomes almost a theorist of poetry and style. And that you know, because I have been mentioning some of them. Some of us maybe we do whatever we think about that: so and so has style. Dante sort of implies that style is really a mode of knowledge. He discusses the song; he discusses themes: what are the great themes of poetry and we alluded to that with Bertran de Born, because Dante says Bertran de Born was the greatest in writing war poetry. He ends with a great definition of poetry: that poetry is that art that combines music — the art of music — and rhetoric together and he ends there. This is the preamble to what we are going to talk about today. There’s those who can perpetrate a fraud on you without even knowing you or without even having anything to do with you. It implies a violation of what Dante calls the erasure of the bonds of love, because it implies friends, family, country, hosts. There’s a language here of the tragic and let’s call it the mythopoeic. I like this idea of Sinon who is an impersonator and a falsifier. And every commentator of yours, mine certainly does, will tell you that Dante’s using just some gibberish. These are the words: “Raphèl may amèch zabi almi’ began the savage mouth to cry, for which no sweeter psalms were fit; and my Leader towards him: ‘Stupid soul keep to thy horn and vent thyself with that when rage or other passion takes thee. This is Nimrod, through whose wicked device the world is not of one sole speech. If you look at it carefully — I really want to tell you something, it is an imperfect — there’s one letter anagram of a Hebrew line from the Psalms, and the reference to ‘sweeter Psalms’ next will tell you that Dante’s really giving you the source. This is really — it’s an amazing — so he’s using Hebrew because that’s what he had said in the , that Hebrew — this is an inverted, twisted language by the builder of the Tower of Babel, we are not supposed to understand it and yet behind all confusion there is still something intelligible, that’s the argument. These are the words, Psalm 22, they are the words that Jesus on the Cross cites, “Father, Father why have you forsaken me?”It’s really the tragic moment or the moment of the Crucifixion where the Son feels that he is completely abandoned and that somehow the whole divine play, the whole divine order is no longer responsive to him. We’re reading from Canto XXXII, line 1 to 12. Here, this is the beginning that in many ways rehashes what last time I called the ineffability topos. This is now the deployment of a variant of that conceit. This is an occurrence of that genre: I can speak; I can tell you. ”Now he tells the story that he was put as a prisoner in a tower, which we are meant to understand all the languages of the other towers. I calmed myself then, not to make them more unhappy, that day and the next we stayed all silent. Borges writes nine lectures on Dante, what else? That is to say, in the moment where he’s dealing with treachery, which I call the most nihilistic of all sins, because you really declare null and void any bond that you may have with others, he uses, and the irony is, to me, glaring the affirmative part. The story here, re-enacting and echoing the story of the cross, seems to say the futility — seems to announce the futility of that sacrifice. That is to say each canticle ends with us looking up, reminding us of where we are and still longing for the stars. Then the alchemists, also represented in a kind of twisted form."
704,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-10,"Census data is often politically influenced and hence inaccurate. The birthrate in developing countries is nearly twice that in developed countries. Most humans live in less developed countries, so the world birthrate is near the higher number. The world birthrate is two and a half times the death rate; we are not close to population stabilization. Almost everywhere, the death rate has been drastically reduced; further changes will not massively affect demographic trends. Changes in fertility rate now control population. Demographic data must be corrected for age structure. A young population in a poor country will have a lower death rate than an older population in a richer country. Countries with high birthrates and exploding populations will have a high proportion of children. There are more people in each younger age bracket than in older ones. Many more adolescents will come into reproductive ages than older women will leave fertile ages. Fertility per woman is falling in the world, but, since there are ever more childbearers, the number of children born does not drop. Because of this ‘momentum,’ it can take over 100 years from when fertility falls to replacement level (approximately 2 children per woman) to when population stabilizes. In developing countries, even though fertility has been reduced, population growth often outstrips economic growth. People may give up on modernization and instead, idealize a return to some imagined past that was glorious.","I’m going to read you something and you have to guess what kind of a scene I’m describing. It was also a good day for the fish because the thousands of fishermen who line the shorelines on Sunday were all at home. Same story, no one would cooperate with him. The poor quality of the United States census. Congress, the House of Representatives is apportioned, so people want their state to have as many representatives as possible. Given the importance of this, why is it so bad? Basically she wasn’t allowed to do that and so she had to resign. She just would not do a census that was less then what we’re capable of doing. We looked a little at the birthrate, and you notice something very interesting; here’s the birthrate we’ve just been saying for the world 21 per 1,000 per year. As you know population stability, which many people think would be a good thing for the world, depends on the deaths and the births being equal, which means that the world is out of kilter, the ratio between births and deaths is now out of kilter by a factor of something like 2.5 to 3; 2.5 for the world, 3 for the developing countries. Okay, now unlike the birthrate which is very different in different parts of the world, the death rate is not extraordinarily different. Do those death rates include the infant mortality rates? This funny thing, you happen to be born young and you die old, and so that is the explanation for that. It’s a wonderful huge amount of information in a single graph; you can see all kinds of things. War deaths; the men are in the Army and the get shot up on the Russian front, so you have many more females then males. So what’s happening here–see what the ages are here, especially in Nigeria, 15 to 45, these are the ages in which women are giving birth and this number of women is giving birth to more than two children, they’re more then replacing themselves, so each bar is bigger than the last, and some of this in-swing, especially this is Sub-Saharan Africa, some of this reduction is infant mortality and child mortality. In another five years, if you look at this five years later, these women who were 40 to 45 are now 45 to 50, no more fertility, pretty much. In Nigeria they’re not using a lot of IVF and everything. It shows this–this is what’s actually predicted to happen, so this is again developing countries and this is the kind of pyramid that we’ve seen. If immediately, God sticks his finger out of heaven and says two children, and even more surprising, people obey him, what happens? What this shows you, of course is that miracle is not going to happen. This is the United Nations guess as to what’s going to happen. Huge amount of momentum effects, here is–let me go back–this is Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean and it’s one of the examples of a small underdeveloped country that had a very surprising fertility decline. Then this fits the standard characterization of the demographic transition. About 20 years later, about one generation later, people learn, well we don’t have to have so many children because they’re not dying, and the birthrate comes down thereafter and population growth is in here."
705,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-11,"Concerns about low fertility have been present in many countries for at least 100 years. A large population was considered essential to national power. But the issue is never simply a shortage of warm bodies: overall the world population has increased dramatically over this period and untold numbers would immigrate, if allowed. The issue is the number of the ‘right sort’ of people, defined as those having preferred national, religious, racial, ethnic, or language characteristics. Fertility levels are below replacement in many economically advanced countries. As a result, these countries are aging; medical and retirement costs are increasing. Countries must either raise fertility, accept immigrants, or adapt to a smaller, older population. Policies to raise fertility have not been very effective, except in severe dictatorships. To keep the ratio of working age people to dependents constant, hundreds of millions of immigrants would be required such that 70-80% of the population of receiving countries would be immigrants and their children. Adaptation is probably best, but the required changes (raise retirement age, tax the pension benefits of the wealthy, etc.) are politically difficult.","I have the pleasure of introducing you to Dr. Michael Teitelbaum. In the developed countries–so in the world as a whole, as you’ve been told, the fertility decline has not been enough to keep the population from still going up very rapidly, we discussed that, but in Europe, Japan, the advanced countries, the fertility decline has caused the population to come down enough, and these countries are now facing rather serious problems of a decline, a possible decline, in their population, certainly a change in behavior structure and this is what Michael is an expert on and so that is what he will discuss today as soon as I shut up. Going through that list of publications makes me realize why my wife has been so annoyed with me for the 40 years nearly that we’ve been married, because a lot of that work has had to be done when I wasn’t an academic and that means it comes out of your hide or out of your summer holidays, or weekends, or evenings, but it’s interesting, exciting, and wonderful to do, and I’ve enjoyed doing it. Now in some respects these were flawed predictions, obviously. All of those projections proved to be empirically wrong. We know better now because we’ve seen they were wrong. Anybody who tells you they know, you should not believe, they have no way of knowing. None of these projections or future looks can assume catastrophe. This in turn would apply–would imply rapid population, increase . The second point I’d like to make is that we are in danger collectively of making two errors of demographic interpretation and these are both significant errors. When I was working on The Hill running a congressional committee, I learned not to use the term ‘cohort,’ because as soon as I said cohort the Congressman would say, ‘you mean your friends, your cohort?’ That’s probably enough about period rates. Demographers have not adjusted to the reality that the meaning of 65 in 1935 was very different from the meaning of 65 in 2005 or 2009. This would be probably unworkable in a liberal democracy. In both the Soviet Union in the 1930s and in Nazi Germany in the 1930s, women got prizes, gold medals, mother heroine awards, gold medals for eight or more children, for example, in the Soviet Union. Those are benign examples but there are some harsh examples. Immigration is often put forward as a way to deal with an aging population. Under conditions of very low fertility, substantial immigration would produce very rapid transformation of the composition of a population socioculturally defined, and historically such rapid changes have led to passionate public opposition. I say here that Israel and Jordan are about 40%, it depends on how you define the Palestinians in Jordan, but if you call them international migrants then it’s 40% or so in Jordan. It’s painful to sit on the fence, but in this case I don’t think there’s a clear correct position on these things. Here are summary and conclusions: very low fertility now is widespread and it’s continuing to spread. There are a whole range of theories about this. From this point of view theoretically, low fertility is permanent and inevitable in advanced societies. If you look at Japan, for example, in Japan you have very low rates of marriage among women in their 20s. Whether it would be desirable as some environmentalist’s think for the population of the world to decline sharply from where it is, six point some billion to whatever they think the carrying capacity of the earth is, and that’s a highly speculative calculation of course is another matter and I don’t think anybody can really resolve those debates. From a policy perspective, I guess specifically for the U.S., are all warm American bodies equal or do you take into consideration economic circumstances or anything else? Governments–if you ask me what is the position of the U.S. or British government on this, they don’t really have one."
706,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-12,"Until recently, the world population has been growing faster than exponentially. Although the growth rate has slowed somewhat, there are about 80 million more people each year and about 3 billion more will be added by 2050 (a 50% increase). Population will probably increase more beyond that. Such growth is unprecedented and we cannot predict its long-term effects. The environmental impact of this population increase is bound to be astronomic. Large populations engender two problems: over-consumption in the rich countries which leads to environmental misery, and under-consumption in the poor countries which leads to human misery. People living in abject poverty ($1 per day) don’t limit their fertility. Factory jobs in poor countries pay double that, approximately $2 per day. For population to stabilize, income must rise. If population is to increase by 50%, income needs to double–we are looking at a tripling of the world economy. The environment is currently overstressed. Can it survive a tripling of the economy?","Okay, we are now at the part of the course–we’re coming up to fairly modern times, it’s been a very breathless run from six million years of chimpanzee evolution through many–few million years of human evolution, and we’re coming up to more or less the 1960s, which is the period of the greatest percentage increase in human population on earth ever. One of the places I went to was Hong Kong. Now Hong Kong at that time there were huge numbers of people coming out of China. I noticed that when something had to be done like the tea had to be gotten, or this that or the other thing, it was that little girl that was doing all the work. Finally, I asked my friends, what’s going on here?A little hard to get the information out of them, but in actual fact it was a form of shall we say family population control that the–there–this was a non-contracepting population so children just coming and they couldn’t support the number of children that they had and they did not value girls very much. As soon as this happens to the girl they just dump her at the British–at whatever the public hospital is and they just abandon them there. In fact, during this period, in fact during most of this period, the percentage rate of growth has been increasing. The problem is that this is unprecedented. I emphasize–guess work–this was not on the original. So when you hear a lot of optimism about the population situation, what they’re talking about is that the peak RATE of growth here in the 1960s has come down as a percentage of the base. We’re adding a billion at 80 million a year we’re adding a billion every 12.5 years. Yet, environmentalists generally never talk about human population; it’s too politically dangerous to talk about that. The other side of the coin is poverty, the world is definitely split and the split is getting wider between poverty and over–people who over consume - and their problem of course is under consumption and they lead to all of the problems of poverty which I have discussed in Hong Kong and I don’t have to tell you very much about what the problems in the world of poor people are. But, at the rate of growth it’s obvious just looking around you that our technology, our economy, our governments, have not been able to cope with this so far. This is the growth of the United States population from 1900 to 2000. That is up to the–almost current, and here is again the latest Census Bureau thing from–again this was–just got it out of the computer last night actually, the latest numbers, that here’s the standard–one of the standard things is give you 100 year time frame, currently they’re using 1950 to 2050 and we are, as you know, right about here and here is the U.S. population growth rate and just almost a perfectly straight line. We reached that number 44 years earlier than the Census Bureau thought, and we are still growing and now the Census Bureau says there is no sign of stabilization at all. I think the CO production in China I think has just outpaced the United States, but I didn’t look that up recently, and so there are equal problems, so if one gets out of one’s head the idea that poor people are going to stay poor forever, which is a pre-globalization idea–now a worker in China can compete with a worker in America and eventually there’s going to be some leveling. These are the appropriate poverty levels for developing countries. Now the miracle–so you’ve all heard of the economic miracle in East Asia especially. Well the average income, and again, income how you define–of course the Chinese don’t earn dollars so when you express it in dollars there’s a translation and the best way of doing it is what’s called PPP, purchasing power parity. A number that makes the Chinese income look more favorable and is closer to a real number is what they call purchasing power parity. In the desert all these people live in shanties of any kind of construction material that they can find. One of the things that we know is that there’s very, very poor people, these $1.00 a day people don’t limit their births and the exact reason for it we’ll discuss later. We can sort of see ballpark a 50% increase coming."
707,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-13,"Surveys show that most women are having more children than they would prefer to have. Further, studies show that the vast majority of women know about various forms of contraception. One World Bank study has shown that family planning programs have little impact unless they are attended by improved living standards and increasing status of women.","It came out the end of last year and it’s from the year 2003. This is various five year bunches, they take these surveys every five years, this is from a thing called The Demographic and Health Surveys which are done basically in every developing country of the world by their own statistical service. If they’ve had no children already very few of them don’t want any children 6.5%. Another factor is women who have had more children are older. Just generational change is a bigger factor in that then you might expect. You remember that you read this in readings in Africa, that when the women were asked how many children do you want, it was a meaningless question to them. Whereas, countries you might not think of wildly different Trinidad, Dominican Republic, Fiji, various other places are way down here. So you have these huge number of women who don’t want–want to stop childbearing and yet if you look from the Demographic and Health Surveys at the contraceptive prevalence, like in Bolivia again, at the time of Robey article that you have read last night or are going to read, the women who want protection either–are about–were about 80% and the women that were using protection was like 12%, and you ask them why and largely, and especially more recently, it’s medical reasons. She went there and it turns out that women are very much influenced by rumors, what they hear, because their education is not really their thing. This student, this Yale undergraduate collected these rumors, and one of the rumors, one of the most extreme rumors was well mostly in Africa, and I think you read this–the people that haven’t been to university don’t distinguish between stomach and uterus, it’s all one big cavity. I think it was, anyway it doesn’t matter; it’s all one thing there. It’s a very complicated issue and the big battle is in getting people thinking about this and trying to do some of that, is sort of how much of this difference and how much of the–people in general having more–how much of it is that there’s something wrong this data that they really do want a lot of children and many of them–in many countries up there they wanted 5, 6, 7, 8 children and how much of it is–they don’t have access–access doesn’t mean just handing out condoms."
708,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-14,"By 1950, in most of the underdeveloped world, mortality had fallen to about half its pre-modern rate. The birth rate, however, had remained high and, by 1950, was about twice the death rate. For the rest of the century, both rates fell dramatically and in parallel, maintaining the gap. The enormous excess of births over deaths in this period is known as ‘the population explosion.’ By 1990, the world population was growing at almost 90 million a year. Comparing the Demographic Transition in Europe and in the currently developing countries, the latter started 100 years later at a much lower economic level, fell from much higher birth and death rates, occurred much faster and with a much higher population growth rate, and added vastly more people. The developing countries saw the benefits that had accrued to the West as a result of the transition and then rapidly appropriated it for themselves. But while European countries may have quadrupled their population over 200 years, third world countries grew by as much as ten times in a much shorter period and they are still growing at a rapid rate. The problems of this rapid growth (still about 80 million a year) abound. The traditional scourges of starvation (9 million deaths a year), disease (AIDS, Tuberculosis, Malaria – all claim between 1 and 2 million deaths per year) and war (Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs with approximately 200,000 deaths) are all far too small to stabilize population. People in developing countries who want to limit their fertility, are often afraid of contraceptives (especially side-effects) and yet are willing to undergo horrendously dangerous illegal abortions to avert a childbirth.","What did I tell you was the traditional, before modern times, death rate? They imposed a lot of violence upon the people but that was apparently much less then the violence that local communities imposed upon each other in the pre-colonial era, so the death rate was down by the 1950s. Sometime in 50s, around 1950, the birth rate started coming down in all those countries, and even though the birthrate starts at these very, very high levels they come down almost everywhere with of course the exception being Sub-Saharan Africa, and you’ve read about why that is and I keep saying that almost everything we say, Sub-Saharan Africa is an exception to the rate. Remember this is per 1,000 so it’s a percent kind of a number, so as the population grows the number of people represented by this percent cap grows and grows, and grows, and so this explains the graph I showed you last time, or two times ago. Anybody have a laser pointer by any miracle? Notice that the deaths and the births are much higher in Mexico than in Europe. Now those are important, but notice the gradualness of the decline here. Rich people with two children, whereas as they previously believed that in order to be rich in some sense you have to have eight children, so the media are very important in changing perceptions. In your reading packet is a one page collection of headlines from Tanzania and you just see all the problems that Tanzania is going through in a period when their fertility is high and maybe beginning to start falling down. This was the time when the population of the developing countries was staying constant. That if there’s nobody left in the developed countries to give the aid, then one of the props which helps developing countries come up will have disappeared. The bad possibilities and have been known–have been thought about for a long time is 1) famine, that people could start starving, disease, AIDS, people are always talking about Aids balancing the population explosion or war. Famine, one way that famine operates is, some country has a big drought and they go through a short period of terrible famine, but that’s not the main thing. We basically in some sense, in a small sense, have had TB. Here’s one of the really saddening pictures that–in the political discourse about population, and fertility, and family planning in America there’s a lot about motherhood, how wonderful motherhood is – everything but you have to see–well I didn’t show that. The organizations, they want you to give money show a lot of them and one of the discussion items about these kind of pictures is that they make people in poor countries seem sort of helpless and that’s not true. In some countries, it has an important demographic effect, but for Sub-Saharan Africa, as a whole, not an enormous effect. It’s this, it’s smoke from cooking fires, that in the developing countries, in the poor countries, this is the way people cook and the smoke fills the room, gets into their lungs, and they get all kinds of diseases extra and the estimates of that is 1.6 million deaths; comparable to tuberculosis and malaria and somewhat less than AIDS.They have a solution to this and it’s a stove that keeps–that you don’t get these kind of smoke with. Interviewer: “Sitan, how many children more would you like to have?”“That is for God to decide. ”Interviewer: “How many boys and how many girls would you like to have?”“It’s God that gives me children. They want to be able to earn money and go around to different neighborhoods. In the 1960s they started with a survey called KAP, knowledge, attitude, practice. This nurse went into the maternity ward; she was a maternity nurse, expecting to see a lot of women having children. This is an Iranian woman packing condoms. We discussed some of this with respect to Africa. So here is a culture without much medicine, a low standard of living; they’re getting sick a lot. The major organizations, the environmental organizations won’t touch it because they do fundraising and the public opinion is that–it’s a horrible thing to push family planning on developing countries."
709,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-15,"In East and South Asia there are many more boys than girls. Previously, this resulted from female infanticide, now it is sex-selective abortion. In those cultures, girls generally marry out of the family as teenagers and thus provide no benefit for the family that raised them. Bangladesh is agriculturally very rich, but its population is so dense that per capita income is one of the lowest in Asia. Despite the poverty, an excellent family planning program has greatly reduced fertility.","There’s a–do you know about the oldest tree in Seoul?: Anyway, it turns out they ran into a problem with this tree because two apartment buildings were interfering with the trees roots as the tree spread its roots. mitochondrial DNA can choose to eliminate male fetuses. Does that sound like a good hypothesis to you? One child policy, when does the one child policy start? We’ll come back to these explanations; they’re all good. No bride price doesn’t happen in either China or India; bride price, you remember, is when the man’s family gives something to the girl or the girl’s family, dowry is the opposite and dowry is common in India and really it was–communists got rid of it, any vestige of that in China so that’s not the case. That’s what’s going on, it’s the cheap ultrasound. This is–and also, just weirdly in most places, it’s the number of boys to girls, but in India the way they define sex ratio is the opposite so I’ve translated into these–these are the numbers that are comparable to what you’ve been hearing. That works for all the chromosomes except for the sex chromosome. There’s good evolutionary reasons why evolution pushes a sexually reproducing species to 100 males and 100 females and we can go into that later perhaps. You’re seeing that–this is at birth, right around birth which is still genetic reasons, and this is all of India. That’s counter-biological, and what that is, is basically some infanticide, but largely female neglect. Whether he would, or would not, have died anyway, who knows. She embraced the corpse with her left hand and reclined her head on his shoulder. No tear was shed by any of the relations. This is, by the way, characteristic of human societies. Now, I want to switch gears here in the time we have left, and this whole lecture is about South Asia, and South Asia and East Asia are the centers of female disadvantage, but that doesn’t go on in all of South Asia. Again we worry a lot and have induced some of the Asians to worry about the sex ratio, that all these men won’t get married, but remember we’re seeing sex ratio disturbances of 12% to 20%, and remember in Europe I showed you this slide that a lot of places only 30%, or 40% or 50% of people got married, so the marriage imbalance is much–was much more severe in Europe for hundreds of years than it is now in Asia. This is what the delta actually looks like. You compare three crops a year to one crop and something like three times as rich. In 1938, Biren Ganguli, a Bengali himself, wrote “Every inch of land that is fit for cultivation is already used. Just to compare you to that, any of you from farm places? If you had a house you had to have three acres so that was enough so that, in Bengal, Bangladesh 30 families would live on these three acres at 0.1 hectare per person. In Pakistan one of the programs was, well people are culturally into having a lot of children and so we must work with their culture, and must work with traditional birth attendants. In one of your readings about Taiwan where you have family planning, a very similar kind of thing. It now is no longer really believed–it’s believed that women almost everywhere, in this case it must be the men, because the men and the mother-in-law’s control the issue–really do want to reduce fertility and if you give them the option, they will accept it. Along the way other places have learned other lessons, so India next door had a much stronger central government because of the Gandhi effect, Gandhi was such a national hero to all the ethnic groups in India, so the government was strong and Nehru was very strong, and Nehru’s daughter Mrs. Gandhi was very strong, and they were Westernized, under the Malthusian influence, and they decided that they need a family planning program also. I think the story of this is that the idea which was prevalent up until the Bangladesh experiment, that only rich countries are going to reduce their fertility is just plain wrong, and now as the fertility transition goes through Asia, it’s now amazing, places–very poor places what’s happening there. Ceylon was one of the first countries in Asia to get down to replacement level, very poor, Ceylon is not a rich place, / one of the poorest provinces of India is down at replacement level; all kinds of countries Thailand, Indonesia, all have really reduced their fertility at amazingly low levels of per capita income."
710,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-16,"China’s early demographic history is similar to that of Europe; population grows only slowly due to war, disease and Malthusian resource limitation. Later, introduction of American foods allowed cultivated land to expand, but population expanded even more rapidly, leading to an extremely dense, but poor population. During this time, female infanticide was frequent, but almost all surviving girls got married. Within marriage, their fertility rate was much lower than that of their European counterparts. This system compares to the English with a low rate of marriage, but high fertility within marriage.","This is one family’s experience, and, as Qing said, it’s quite different for different people, but what you should realize is that this is one of 300 million such stories. 300 million people is the total population of the United States. The basic set up of the story is that in about 1800, when Malthus was writing, China was very powerful, very strong, a very rich country and the West was beginning to be that way. And industry, the people worked very hard and whatever they did they were very productive at it. There was enough seafaring; they could go around the world and compare different things, and try to figure out what was the best system for people to live under. You can see the birth–the medical statistics, again as far as we have them, and up until recent times from the practice of acupuncture you don’t see any form of disease lessened at all and the only thing you see in China, and Japan also, is a tremendous rise in hepatitis because of the transmission from the needles because they didn’t understand anything about sterilization. When the Ming came to power there was still land–unoccupied land available. Again, like Europe and like Africa, American foods, when they were discovered, went into China because they, as I said, have something like twice the caloric content of anything except rice. This makes good sense in the Chinese culture. One of the big issues now under discussion is whether this is a sign whether the Chinese were consciously doing some kind of birth control, they were consciously trying to limit their families, or whether it was one of these cultural things where the culture in some sense stumbles onto a practice and it makes that culture successful, even though the people have no idea what the purpose of it is. The reason for this, as the Chinese would see it, is that the Confucian ethic, they don’t have–it’s not a religious thing at all, there’s no sense of a deity or anything supernatural going on, but personal relationships are what’s important. Husband and wife did not relate to each other as lovers or even as friends. Actually we may not get to it until next time but that’s still, again we’re pushing–we still haven’t explained why the population is more dense–it’s getting time–let me just finish saying something about this 10% to 25% getting rid of the females, which again, would reduce the population would lead you to not think there was such a density. We’ll see–I’m sorry next time we’ll continue and we’ll see what is one of the theories for why China got into the difficulties, it was not just uncontrolled reproduction."
711,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-17,"Families lived together in traditional China and sons remained on the land; division of family land led to tiny plots and rural poverty. Because labor was so cheap, the country did not urbanize or mechanize. The Communist government started out with a pro-natal stance, but after experiencing the famine of the Great Leap Forward, moved strongly to fertility control. Fertility declined rapidly in the 1970s, but to counter momentum, the One-Child Policy was introduced in 1979-80. Nevertheless, population has now risen to over 1.3 billion.","Now in the last lecture we talked about how China has had this very dense population of very poor peasants, for a very long time, and we started discussing some of the possibilities for why that would be. In China, after marriage, the son remained living in his parent’s compound and the daughter-in-law moved in with them; very, very standard kind of situation. There was no separate economic unit for the married children. The parents have responsibilities toward the children; the children have responsibilities toward the parents. But, the son probably doesn’t want it as times modernize. The Chinese did not practice primogeniture. This had the good benefit that no one was forced, and one of the cultural reasons for it, that with land you could start a family, you could have children, you could have sons, so no one would be forced into the situation which was unbearable in traditional Chinese culture of not having a son. There was no direct obligation recognized between the child and the parent. The two systems were really–the European and Chinese were sort of diametrically opposite and the Chinese system was in a sense much kinder because no one would–in Europe children were sort of basically sacrificed, goodbye, have a good time in life, we’ll see you. The land parcels on which people tried to survive were just so tiny that they were up against an absolute limit. The money that could have fueled the industrial revolution was in fact going to China to feed a caffeine addiction. It was really a massive, massive effect and so the British started importing opium into China, from India, in an attempt to reverse the balance of trade, which it did. Basically China was devastated by this 115 years of dissolution of the government and being taken advantage of by foreign powers. Especially the dry and hilly land, you may remember last time I told you that as American foods came in and farming increased, that people learned that they could grow food on hilly land and dry land, and so the population expanded into this marginal land. He’s got 1/3 of an acre, three times as much. There was a big campaign to swat flies; the flies were spreading disease from the feces which was not in–not flushed away in toilets. So the same thing, swat a fly and they killed zillions of flies. In 1953 the country was stable enough that they took their first national census. If the woman did this twice, then traditional medicine said that the woman would be permanently sterile. Whenever your view of the world gets out of kilter with the reality, disaster is right behind and the disaster is indeed not far behind and that was the Great Leap Forward. The context of the Great Leap Forward is that the U.S., in particular, had threatened China and been threatening China with nuclear, basically annihilation, and Mao had answered with this: ‘I have so many people if you kill a couple of hundred million who cares’; very brutal response and counter response. Again you do; we don’t have too many native-borns here, but it was very, very big, the backyard iron and it resulted in two things. It also was a pro-feminist measure that who had to do the work at home was the women. In a poor family, if there’s food available, you eat just exactly what you need to stay alive, and you store away the rest for the future, because the future is always very uncertain. The concatenation of those two things was the disaster. The official Chinese statistics show the death rate going from 10 million to 25 million, and you have to look at the area because there’s one, two, three years of it so they’re estimating more like maybe 25 million deaths, that’s the official Chinese statistics. The most delicate thing that humans make are their social and political arrangements. So, the demographics of their current fertility, a low fertility, rate–2.5, their current low fertility rate but the tripling of women coming into reproductive ages, the mathematics tells you, you have to set–you have to somehow get your fertility rate down to 0.8.They decided that was going to be very difficult and they instituted the one-child policy at that time. Although, you should note, that again, it wasn’t the government–the abortion that Qing told you about had nothing to do–in one sense had nothing immediately to do with the government."
712,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-18,"1) Population in China: Until recently, Chinese families did not much alter their fertility depending on life events such as deaths of children. However, under government prodding and eventually coercion, fertility dropped drastically in China in the 1970s, but to counteract momentum, the One-Child Policy started in 1979-80. 2) Population Growth and Economic Development: In Asia, rapid fertility drops have preceded economic booms by approximately fifteen years. In this time, children grow up and become workers. With many workers and fewer children to support, savings and investments rise causing the boom. Non-Asian countries with rapid fertility drops, like Ireland, fit this model. Sub-Saharan Africa, with still high fertility, makes little economic progress.","You remember, when I was talking about Europe, we discussed the fact that during marriage Europeans just had babies, in a sense willy-nilly, but we also said it was nowhere near the maximum that humans are capable of, but we thought it was sort of cultural constraints, late marriage, and stuff like that. I’m sorry; the age at which they stop depends on the age at which they start to a large degree. You can also see the numbers are very high; those that have had seven children already, 76% proceed to have another birth. They try just a little bit longer, three months longer. It turns out that one arm of the government was doing something to the opposite effect of another arm of the government. If people don’t believe in a policy, they don’t want to obey the government and everybody is related, your uncle second removed can’t really enforce a policy on you if you’re a relative, especially in a culture where kinship means so much and the relationship between relatives means so much. After seven daughters he finally got a male heir in 1989. Isn’t the case; there’s whole books now on how China is actually ruled, and the story is that the government almost gives a slogan, it’s a one-child policy, or they sometimes call it the only child policy, is not a set of rules it’s kind of almost a slogan. There’s no–absolutely no uniformity from village to village. What that resulted in was the policy was never able to be consistently put into practice. Throughout the 1980s, which again was when the policy was strictly enforced, nearly half of all the births were second, third, or higher order births. This–what happens to population I think, in the long term view, and long terms means 25 or 50 years, I’m not talking 1000 years, probably the one most important thing which will determine the future of the U.S. economy is what happens to population in China and India, and you can include Indonesia and the rest of Asia. A further thing happening, there are now a few 100 million people floating around the cities, migrant laborers trying to get jobs, and now with the current economic climate, being thrown out of jobs, but Chinese agriculture is incredibly inefficient. What they’ll do now, with the economic collapse, I don’t know. Before this all started, no one would have thought this was possible. If you can read the literature of that time, China was hopeless. When the Chinese talk about economic development, it’s not only manufacturing more stuff which they basically are not too interested in, they ship it to America. This was of course against public policy, but it may have infected a million people, this blood selling in Henan Province, especially and virtually all of them poor peasants who sold the blood to make money. In 1958 two American demographer economists had a different idea. It turns out that George Bush, the senior, the first George Bush President, when he was a congressman was one of the sponsors of the very first family planning bill, not only for domestic family planning but also the international aid for family planning. It was very interesting because just at that time Romania, the host of this meeting, was having the most extreme family planning program ever, but in the opposite direction. It never came down to its original level and there’s actually a fairly big total effect of their policy. But you are seeing a big time effect in this time frame. What happens is, you calculate this dependency ratio; this is the number of working age people to non-working age and look what happens in East Asia. The dependency ratio just gets better and better for East Asia and this has tremendous–this is what has tremendous economic consequences. Look, here the black is East Asia and the green is Ireland, looks very, very similar. This is the dependency burden, here again, the ratio of workers to non-workers really improving in China, not going anywhere particular in India.\When you compare it to Sub-Saharan Africa–again so we’re comparing different parts of the world to show you the story–is the same. This is the birth rate, the black, and the death rate so a huge and continuing population; growth rate again up to the line, this is guesswork out here and here is–again you’ve seen this before, this is China’s–East Asia’s dependent ratio workers to children. The end of this story is that, again, we talked about when–a long time ago when I describe Algeria’s–how much Algeria has gotten their fertility down but their population is still growing and they haven’t been able to take advantage of a reduction in fertility. I mean forget the last half year or something."
713,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-19,"Data shows, consistently, that poor people have more children than rich people; economically speaking, children are an inferior good. Children are production goods because they do work, consumption goods because they are enjoyable, and investment goods because they support parents in old age. Jobs in the modern sector require education and health. To pay for this, parents have to focus their resources on fewer children.","Now I have–to–I must tell you that I have very bad news for you. How much this line increases for a particular change in income is called the elasticity, how big a change there is. Something that as people get richer they buy less of. You change what you want to eat depending on your income and you can eat less of what you previously did. It’s a very interesting thing; you have big culture differences between countries. You can take a ratio of family income to number of children and that ratio for different groups is probably a measure of how inferior you are. What Swift suggested was that the Irish eat their children. They just–people generally don’t want to consider themselves commodities. Most theory depends on rational actor theory. A production good is something you buy, like a machine for a factory to do work. In a peasant family children do a lot of work for the family. You can imagine all this down on a clipboard. As the child gets older they require less and less from the family and they start doing more work for the family. Most of the time, and I’ll show you some data on this, required for childrearing is spent by the mother. That means you pay now you, get a return later. One of the things they discussed was family planning; in fact, a nun had been speaking in the class strongly in favor of family planning trying to convince them that they shouldn’t have so many children, that they would be better off with fewer children, which was the experience of his social class. The other side of the coin is pretty much the same; the parents are living longer. The increased longevity of both children and parents make it a much better deal to have children as an investment good, because there’s a longer time they can pay you and you’re going to be around for a longer time to get this. The outside economy is modernizing, you may not be modernizing but the outside economy is modernizing, and jobs become available, largely jobs that require some sort of education; white collar jobs, the government jobs. If you have a bond, like a kid, you’ve got to have a safe-deposit box for it, that’s like health insurance or healthcare for it, otherwise it’s going to disappear on you. An interesting thing, we have two different factors that are now in play, why a child becomes a good investment good. If there’s free education you get them educated, send them to the city, and you can do that if there’s no cost to getting a child educated third, fourth, fifth, sixth there’s no limit to the number of children that you could have, you send them all off to the city, they send you back money. Because the government doesn’t have money to pay these people, they get paid very poorly, so corruption; if you give us a very small bribe this is a wonderful thing for the bureaucrat, so he’ll pay attention to your thing and only take two days instead of three days to approve whatever it is you’ve given him. Technological progress ensues and allows them better shipping, better navigation, they get all the way to America, discover American foods, bring them back and start a population increase in Europe. More food means less death and so population increases and this starts in the 1700s in Europe and really starts–1900s in the currently developing countries and we saw before that sometime–that the relationship between mortality drop and fertility drop was not a given, but in almost all cases, whether they went in parallel and mortality was below fertility. At the same time, with respect to the currently developing countries, the Western governments either out of the goodness of their heart or because they’re scared about revolution, and communism, and anti-Americanism, they have to help the third world so they start supporting family programs and what they do is two things. Their economic interest is in having fewer children but if they’re–if there are not the contraceptives available as say in China, there was for a long time, or it’s not culturally acceptable, they can’t act on that desire. When you start looking at this in more detail things don’t turn out to be so convincing. They were interested in–largely in the pressures on them which they were feeling. Of course nowadays for you, parents don’t expect probably anything from you in return as an investment, just to pay one year of Yale is probably more than some Chinese might make in their whole life. We talked about the mother’s time, so as you remember, the cost of children is not just what you spend in cash but it’s the opportunity cost of childcare time. Here is an interesting thing, so as this data gets more sophisticated, you say well does childcare mean?"
714,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-1,"Reproduction is not simple or easy, nor is it fair. Females often bear a larger reproductive burden of child bearing and child rearing. Reproductive strategies can be simplified into two primary strategies for males and two for females: males often either engage in sperm competition or physical competition while females strategize to get resources from males, or to find the best male genes for the offspring. Rape and violence, as reproductive strategies, occur in few species, but violence is especially prevalent among the great apes, probably because eggs are so scarce in these species. Among orangutans, rape is common. For gorillas, infanticide is a common form of reproductive violence, and male chimpanzees regularly fight each other and batter females.","I want to start today with some stories from the newspapers: to set a tone. The uncle said she had shamed the family by leaving home a few days before. Islamabad, Pakistan Zahida Perveen, 21-years-old was pregnant in 1998 when her husband, Mehmood Iqbal, bound her hands and feet with a rope. Gosarigaon, Bangladesh: I’m almost done with this. A young man had become obsessed with her; she was married and he was turned away. Eventually the perpetrator’s family had to pay a fee of $3,000.In one year, the year I have statistics for, 1999, there are 174 acid attacks in Bangladesh and those are the ones that were officially reported. Well these stories are obviously at the extreme of human behavior, but the purpose of giving you all that is to explain that human sexual behavior has extremely deep roots, very emotional, and very hard to change or manipulate. Male/female relationships are very difficult for humans to cope with. I don’t think they came close to an answer. The first one is that reproduction turns out to be very difficult. It’s not only difficult but it’s not fair. This now does not require zillions and zillions of sperms. You’ll see she sometimes will not mate with a male unless that male gives her some resource. This happens of course in motile–motile animals–sperm competition is the original thing where you spew zillions of sperms and then the best ones find–are the ones that find the females, but once they’re motile, the males can come into contact with each other and they can fight in some way and control a territory, for instance. Well generally the males will actually fight with each other for dominance and then use that dominance to gain access to females. The females have also two basic strategies. The more separated the male and the female, when you spew out into the ocean eggs and sperm there’s no control whatsoever. One of the interesting ways of looking at this is internal fertilization, as in humans. That’s why it’s so dangerous because it’s part of the human female strategy to control what males inseminate her is to not lubricate, but if she’s forced there can be a lot of damage done to her. By choosing these males that are not creeping around, she presumes that she’s getting a male with a good–with good genes. Males may fight, and you set up a dominance hierarchy, but there’s nothing that says the female has to choose the top dog, maybe she wants to choose the middle dog or a bottom dog, but in general in species, females choose the top dog. Well if the males are fighting each other and reproductive success depends on winning these fights, then males will tend to get larger. Sometimes, however, sex happens in quite a different way. Most likely it is the extreme unavailability of eggs, so it’s an extremely rare–in the great apes it’s extremely rare to find a female who has an egg ready to be fertilized, why?Well first, primates take many years to become sexually mature. The offspring stay with the mother until adolescence, very much like the chimpanzee story and like the human story. A Dutch observer judged half the copulations to be rape, so these are not rare events. Now gorillas live in a region, and have an ecology that they have more food available to them, so they live in somewhat larger groups and in gorillas the females stick close to the male. Chimpanzees advertise it, everybody knows. It’s a very, very dangerous unpleasant time. The violence is so great that when a male approaches a female, she doesn’t know whether he’s coming to be–to try to mate with her or to be violent toward her because as you’ll read in the reading how the males have a long history of being violent to the females. The male has to–when the male comes and wants to mate with female, he has to signal to her don’t run away, I’m not going to try to beat you up and he has–this is–orangutans, gorilla, chimpanzee with her young."
715,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-20,"Rates of teen pregnancy in the US are quite high, in contrast to European countries which have much lower rates, especially those with liberal attitudes toward sexuality. Traditionally, puberty and marriage were simultaneous. Now, the many years spent in education leaves a long time between those life stages. Sex education is not particularly strong. Contraception has allowed the rate of teen pregnancy to decrease steadily in spite of the fact that teen sex is consistently increasing. Non-marital childbearing is high in all industrialized countries.","As you undoubtedly have noticed, most of the course has been–I sort of have a global focus and mostly focused on foreign countries with a fair amount on Europe and very little actually on America. Just to start with some data and keep it local, this is from , last November 19, 2008. As part of the problem, of those that have had sex, or are sexually active, 37.3% reported that they did not use any kind of protection at the last act of intercourse and therefore they’re at great risk for pregnancy. I’m sure that–we don’t really know the causes of it, I’m not aware of any real academic literature on that, but the fear of AIDS there’s a perception, which is true, that oral sex is less likely to–not zero likely, but less likely to transmit AIDS.And also because, maybe–I don’t know how much you’re aware of this, but during the Bill Clinton trials, a very conservative prosecutor Kenneth Star, was talking about oral sex all the time and everybody in America learned about it and he sort of popularized it. That’s a story, Colorado, Hartford, it’s all around. Now what is this–the social–the political, the social, the school response to this problem? There was a proposal in the city council to allow the schools to distribute condoms, and it was roundly turned down. The political concern is what you can see here, that people who are opposed to providing contraception for teenagers, including politicians, this is an advocacy ad, this is not an academic sort of thing. Anyway, America is generally in a mess with respect to sex education and sex in general. The U.S. rate is 54 per 1,000 teens, about one out of 20 each year, and in the Netherlands the figure is 7, so eight times lower, and it’s a huge difference depending on the country attitude. In China they have an interesting system. One of the explanations for the low rate of Chinese fertility within marriage is that boys rarely have sexual interest in their sisters, at least not for long, and so this kid grows up and this girl, older girl, has been taking care of him and by the time they get married there’s no sexual interest hardly at all. One of the most common ways–so the marriage–the first–There will often be a first wife, not necessarily the first woman that’s taken into the household for the sexual relations with the husband but what’s called the first wife and she will be prominent. Even in the United States of course marriage is not a uniform legal situation. Of women age 20 to 24, 58% became pregnant before marrying. A little bit of the biological background to these issues and some of this, I don’t have to tell you about, because you were teenagers yourself very recently. When you were a little kid you did whatever mommy says, more or less. Now adolescent sexuality is more or less disruptive depending a lot on the culture. It was introduced with what she perceived to be a fair amount of violence. Remember on her wedding night she had no clue what was going on and the women come and investigate her before the marriage ceremony and it must be an extremely scary business. I may have mentioned this in a previous lecture, and the conservatives were very upset about this, and they were opposed to this because they considered that raising of the marriage age to be much too liberal for Iranian society. We don’t have any idea what happened there, but getting married, like the five year old boys in China getting married does not–you don’t know what the means with respect to sex. In the old days you were a peasant, you were a farmer, and things were done the way they had always been done and little kids, starting at age five, six, seven started going into the fields with his mother or his father, or both of them, and watching how the farming is done. Now the period of time between the onset of adolescence and sexual desires and marriage, becomes longer and as time goes on this gets longer and longer and it’s the same story for men. This is for females and this is for males showing the same thing. This bump here, where it raised temporarily, was significant. I’m sorry birthrate, yes sorry my mistake. It was in 1965, so partway through this drop, that it became legal but it was used very heavily. The birthrate drops for married women, but for teenagers it drops much more slowly, and that’s the tradeoff between that they’re having more sex so you expect it to go up, but they’re using contraception, so it’s going down. And I think the data here shows that, I don’t make any kind of moral statement or ethical statement, but that if they don’t have it than non-martial teen birthrate is going to be fantastic. There’s now good studies of all of these and none of them work and the information on that is in your reading. It’s about a third of all births are to unmarried women of all ages and that’s continued on in a slow rise since then. This is kind of a huge sea change in American childbearing practices. Again, you have to be careful about over-interpreting this data because what you might–they get married young there also, so a fair amount of this is marital teen birthrate, and again the data isn’t readily available. There is welfare involved but it’s a within-the-family kind of welfare."
716,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-21,"Abortion is very common both worldwide and in the US. There is one abortion for every 3.2 live births. In places where contraception is not used, abortion is used as birth control. Neither legal nor religious proscriptions have a strong effect on abortion rates. In countries where abortion is illegal, maternal death rates are extraordinarily high. Legal, medically done abortions are safer than getting pregnant. Psychological responses depend on the individual and the culture.","We’re coming to the end of the course, and the last couple of lectures, the last few are social issues and then we’ll have a very short time for environment, unfortunately. It has tremendous political significance. Large numbers of people vote for a candidate for, say president, based solely on whether they are pro-choice or pro-life. Both sides agree that the issue is about sex. Pro-life women think that women are so important that their special life role of motherhood must be protected. There are a number of important things that you should know about abortion. Both the highest rate and the lowest rates are found in Europe. Western Europe has 12 abortions per 1,000 women per year; Eastern Europe has four times as many, 44 per 1,000 women per year. Note that 105; we’re talking about abortions per live births. But, from the last compilation in 1995, the estimate was 46 million abortions and now it’s down to 42 million abortions. There has been a very small drop in the number of abortions. Eastern Europe; again they had an extremely high abortion rate, it was the mechanism of contraception there, and they’re gradually becoming accustomed to contraception so their abortion rate is going down, three-quarters of the change in the whole world is all due to Eastern Europe. Contraception was legal, it was kind of available but the manufacturing was terrible. What this tells you is, if they’re not using contraception, they’re going to get pregnant and that the mortality dangers, this is deaths, so this is mortality, that the mortality dangers from pregnancy are a good bit higher than any of the methods of birth control. When you go the developing world, this is United States data, when you go to the developing world of course pregnancy itself is much more dangerous. In Africa where it’s illegal almost everywhere it’s 29, so again, no difference. Abortion is becoming legal in more places. This is all Europe, Japan, Australia, United States, very developed countries. The most extreme example of this and the clearest example of this is from Romania. Then, very rapidly, women set up networks of illegal abortion providers and the birth rate goes up and the birth rate comes back down and it ends up somewhat higher than it had been beforehand, but not enormously higher. It rose to 200 per 100,000 live births, from a number in a developed country that was something in the tens or twenties. Abortion peaks and starts falling down, contraception continues upward. You’ll see when you get a polemicized discussion of this, what you’d hear is right to life people say, ‘contraception is no good, abortion rises with contraception’ and they use statistics from this half on down. So it’s the contraceptive, this is a really big difference, the contraceptive prevalence is much lower in the control region than in the experimental region. In Latin America abortions have been practiced for centuries. Ten years later in the 1970s now it’s–where women are really into their fertility decline, they don’t want the children, the average woman has almost three abortions, lifetime, so that goes up. They don’t have much popular support and so the government needs to get legitimacy from somewhere and in this case they get legitimacy from the Catholic Church because, again, the Philippines is a very Catholic country. The Planned Parenthood Federation of Connecticut here, I was associated with them at the time, got in contact with the Ukraine–the whole Ukraine was left like bereft of contraception. One of the things that they did, and we helped them, was we got some of these right-to-life films, which show, in the goriest way, what the fetus looks like and what an abortion is like and you know are really are way, way off the deep end and shipped them to them so they could show their patients and say, ‘see an abortion is not just this sort of nothing kind of event. ’The most interesting case might be Cuba which has one of the highest abortion rates in the world, 78 per 1,000 women per year, compared to Canada which has 15.5, for instance, again that’s the two sides of the United States. The medical–the government and the medical establishment want to get people–wean people off abortion. This was a 31 year old woman on her fourth abortion. That’s a 17 year old girl after her first abortion. Because abortion is such a large fraction of the birthrate, if abortion disappears and is not replaced by contraception, the population growth rate goes crazy."
717,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-22,"Guest lecturer William Ryerson is President of the Population Media Center which produces radio and TV serial dramas in developing countries that aim to effect behavior change on women’s status, family planning and AIDS. Working with governments and in-country media professionals, these melodramas run for hundreds of episodes and are watched by millions. Careful research shows major changes in audience knowledge, attitudes and practices.","Today we’re enjoying the first beautiful day in quite some time. Eventually he founded this group, The Population Media Center, and is both the founder and the President of PMC.These soap operas are different than the kind of soap operas that we’re used to in America. What’s nice about him, and due to his Yale training of course, is that both in the design of these programs, he uses really good academic research, what’s really known about social change and the induction of social change, they just don’t go off and be artsy-fartsy about anything. I knew it would come to me sooner or later when those synapses connected. – Fatalism is the subject of a very interesting paper by Etienne Van Der Walt. He said, ‘Well this is a meeting about family planning, what’s the status of women got to do with it?’By 1994, the most recent U.N. Conference, which I also attended, the world had come to recognize that the status of women is central to everything having to do not only with population but with economic development. There is a huge need to change the bias among many people around the world that their daughter’s place is in the kitchen, or for sale to some man in a polygamous marriage, and their son’s place is in school. It can be invested in education, it can be invested through the government and infrastructure, both of those build economic productivity. Infrastructure is also, as I mentioned, a key issue for economic productivity. A thousand farmers of India a couple of weeks ago committed mass suicide. Climate change is indeed the very visible example of why our current pattern is unsustainable. Population, by the way, is a climate issue. They existed, but my parents thought they were a bad idea, and they may have been right, I don’t know. These are the countries in which we have been working. Sabido then became intentional in promoting this and he ran an epilogue in which he gave addresses of registration sites for adult education. It generated 400,000 letters from viewers to the Indian Television Authority, half of them addressed to characters by name, with advice on who they should marry and so on, but a lot of testimonials on how the program was impacting the audience members. Thato Ratsebe,  who is now working for Population Media Center–she is flying to Nairobi today. This guy was a sexual athlete, he was having a wonderful time, he had girlfriends everywhere draping over him at every truck stop, and so it attracted a huge male following, more men than women in this audience, but overall 58% of the adult population listening. And parent’s won’t take the daughters back because they’re damaged goods and it would bring shame on the family. Now this is starting to change and courts are starting to allow these women to escape. In West Africa we did a program dealing with child slavery. This is a documentary about this Philippine program introduced by Jane Fonda and then the documentary is by Barbara Pile. That’s a half hour documentary but you saw the part about it that is on that soap opera, and I guess with that I thank you for your attention and I’d be happy to take questions. In Latin America, its daily, daytime and primetime. It’s hard to know really, but clearly, probably the lack of sophistication leads to greater influence of the programs but it’s hard to know."
718,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-23,"The idea that “life begins at conception” is not a scientific one. Since the disproof of ‘spontaneous generation’ (1668-1859), we have known that life only derives from life. Life arose billions of years ago and has continued since as a cycle. Assigning a beginning to a cycle (like the year) is arbitrary. The Bible describes the cycle as “Dust to Dust.” Exodus describes a forced abortion as a property crime, but taking the life of the mother as a capital crime. The New Testament does not refer to abortion.","We’ll start a little slow because I’m sure some people are coming. The center of the abortion debate is ‘when does life begin,’ and luckily that’s a question that biology can say something about. The fetus is a live human being, distinct from, while dependent on, its mother. With sexual reproduction–there’s always some version of this one copy/two copies cycle. What else, what grows in your garden that you eat many mornings? Some of the cells in the epithelium start differentiating differently than a skin cell and they pop out into the center here. What the cell does is mitosis; it’s the normal state where cells double but then they split. After my initial shock, I get over it; I look at it and say, that’s a fake. This was put in not by the scientific authors, it’s not mentioned in the article, so you’re not supposed to take it seriously. When did they–do you remember when this was shown to be not the case? As we’ll see in a little bit, human life was presumed to come from menstrual blood, which is also dead and as a sort of coagulation kind of process. In everything from an insect to a human, spontaneous generation was the most obvious interpretation of what you could observe for many hundreds of years, until the experimental techniques really took over and people started showing that was not true. Now more educated people, when discussing this in more detail, understand that it’s a cycle but they decide that fertilization is the final genetic–sets the final genetic constitution of the fetus and therefore we can legitimately say–point to that as the origin point. Even moderately sophisticated things that educated people believe about development and when it begins are just plain wrong. There’s never been anything dead in the past of that. If it takes five months to get pregnant, what happens in the other four months? Different cultures have decided different start points for this cycle of life. Among the Fulani of West Africa, Nigeria, an infant becomes a person and it’s given a name seven days after birth because that’s the most extreme period. St. Thomas Aquinas tied together, it actually comes from Aristotle and we’ll go back to that in a minute, tied, in Catholic theology, the ability to move with animation being alive and that happens at–we now call it quickening, when the mother can feel the fetus start to kick. It may not be ready to have any kind of response to it. All of those designations are equally legitimate and equally illegitimate. Science will describe to you all the stages of the cycle, but it won’t say anything about where you should say the beginning of the cycle is. Since the development of the fetus in the uterus is continuous, there’s no particular point in time that you can say; this stage is different than the day before. But there, the mother knows it before everyone else. Well what is the cycle of life described in the Bible? There’s something moderately explicit about that. Created Adam in his own image, well the image of God is not–it’s not a fertilized egg, right? I have no one able to tell me that, neither my father nor my mother, nor the experience of others, nor my own memory. The New Testament and the Roman Empire are contemporaneous of course, and so the conclusion is that, even though abortion was very, very common at that time and used by all classes of people, there was not an issue for the New Testament writers. Life for life, eye for eye, and then what is the third thing, tooth for tooth; that lets you know right away, babies don’t have teeth, that’s sort of the one thing that they’re missing and the fact that this passage selects that as the third thing to describe is a very clear indication that it’s not the fetus they’re talking about, but it’s the mother. Have any of you heard this passage used in these debates? “After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she hid herself” … “in the sixth month Gabriel was sent …” to announce to Mary that she would bear Jesus, and the angel Gabriel explicitly explains to Mary that Elizabeth is now six months pregnant, “And behold, your kinswoman Elizabeth, in her old age, has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. The female menstrual blood, however, is incapable of doing this by itself. These–you all know this story, so we now interpret conception. Then, it was much later–they didn’t see human eggs in mammals, even mammal eggs that–You can see eggs of chickens, you can see eggs of insects, they’re pretty obvious. You can see eggs of fish, they’re pretty obvious, but the egg of a mammal is so tiny that it can’t be seen. There is much more, you have some very interesting reading on this topic, and there’s infinite amount of reading that you can do on it."
719,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-24,"World population will continue to rise until at least 2050. Environmental impact is the product of the number of people and how much of their income and technology is devoted to either consumption or conservation. So far, the balance is far at the consumption end and, globally, environmental problems are increasing. Environmentalism has not come close to counteracting the footprint of a billion extra people every dozen years. The only massive success has been the decline in global fertility. People want fewer children, the contraceptive technology is available, and the cost is minimal. The only realistic possibility for ameliorating the environmental crisis might be to facilitate the continued decline of fertility.","the beginning of the course a little video, but it was not in the right format. I think I showed you–early in the course when I was discussing quantitative methods, the US Census Bureau projection and that more or less mimics this one. Meaning that if X, Y, Z, P or Q happens then this will be the course of population but they don’t say which of these things is going to happen, if any of them. The constant fertility one, fertility remains constant at an average of more or less 2.8 or 2.85. In this rise that we’re now increasing at, from 1970-up to 2007 , the average rise was about 78 million a year. There are a lot of reasons why things may not continue to get better. Religious fundamentalism is another thing that we know. Our own school of Environmental Studies here, Forestry. I was shocked and I said, ‘but, and I won’t tell you his name, but that’s exactly the opposite of what you taught in the course.’ But there’s just as many reasons to think that, no, things will turn around and fertility will go back up. How does one relate this population increase to environmental destruction to decay of the environment? And technology, so nowadays if we want to knock down a forest we use bulldozers and chainsaws, chainsaws that will cut down a 40 foot tree with one swipe. You should keep in mind that this is a tautology. We’ve exported a fair amount of our environmental concerns to other parts of the world by having them manufacture stuff and bringing it in here, and knocking down their forests to bring in wood and so forth, and the Chinese and the Japanese have done just the same kind of thing. So the good that it does use, it gets you how many–to drive a mile you use less gas, not enormously less, but somewhat less. One is the expansion of humans into almost every habitat on earth. During the rainy season and this is what it looks like in that country. The animals, I don’t know if you can see an animal back here, the animals use it to drink and relieve themselves and here’s girls washing in this water. This is in the good time of the year; this is the water that they have to survive on. There’s great drought, as you know, right now. Then, eventually, you ask yourself, how does water get into rock?The reason is it drips in there. If you ever paid attention to the roof on your house, you know that water gets in, no matter what you do. That when you’re sitting on top of this aquifer you’ve got the rock and the water, water is incompressible so it holds up the rock. She was shaking her head, as maybe she knows. Probably almost all of you today have already today eaten something that was farmed in the San Joaquin. How come all this stuff doesn’t also just sink down evenly? Because it’s all–it’s uneven and I don’t really know the answer to that. In actual fact what happens is that, in the fishing, there’s presumably good fish that people like to eat, and what happens is, as those get fished out you go down to the next level of fish. That’s because the fish that you ate two or three years are now gone because they’ve been fished out, so the quality of the fish goes down and down. As the world economy increases, the pressure on the environment gets worse and worse. There’s usually–like Bolivia which is not one of your most advanced countries, and universally around the world 70%, 80% of the women want to not have children. You don’t have to spend a lot of money, most of the people in the world will be ‘Yeah, rah, rah, I want that,’ and we’ve seen from Ryerson’s lecture here that with a very little bit–I mean he puts on one soap opera which runs for two, three times a week for like a year which is significant but very small intervention and very cheap, and the number of people going to family planning clinics doubles and triples and it just–an incredible amount of progress with a very small input, so this is a very, very doable thing."
720,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-2,"Chimpanzee males compete for position in a dominance hierarchy; status often depends on support from other members, including females, of the group. High-ranking males have much greater sexual access to females in estrus. Males control females by physical violence and intimidation. Chimpanzees also engage in purposeful raids to kill members of other chimpanzee groups. This inter-group violence can help explain intra-group violence. To fend off attack from other groups, males must remain in groups and that requires males to compete for mating opportunities within the community. Competition for the scarce resource, eggs, leads to male-male violence and male coercion of females. If the alpha male monopolized all reproductive potential, then evolution would push non-dominant males to either fight continually for dominance or to leave the group and find females elsewhere. The chimpanzee solution is to allow all males some, though very unequal, reproductive possibility.","The girls who had been splashed with acid by the Taliban on the way to school. Yes, so the front and center story in  is–let me get my pointer. This is–we’re very liberal minded here in this class. A few of you, so I should give a very short summary of what went on last time. Or the female wants to choose the male with the best genes; in some ways the males have to display what are the best genes, and best just means those that are successful reproductively. The females either watch the male’s display, watch the peacock’s tail, or observe the end of fighting between the males; that one male becomes dominant then the female is happy to copulate with that male. My college girlfriend, I fell, I guess, in love with her, because she could do the Latin and I couldn’t. Again, always coping with this idea of the rarity of female eggs. Ah, that’s a picture of the orangutan that fell in love with the grad student. We don’t always use the word here but think–one of the other things if you want to compare chimps and humans, think of the various things that humans do for status. The females are usually quite promiscuous with their sex partners. Forget this; I don’t know how this happens. One aspect is violence but they also make friends with other males. Every so often he stands upright and stares back at the direction from which he had come. We have some of our faculty members like that. They should want to choose either the male with the best genes, or the male who’s giving them the biggest gift, or something and this just sort of compliance under any circumstance, it was obvious that that’s what they were observing but it didn’t make any sense. Finally, they observed more–the chimps were obviously not terribly easy to observe and over a lifetime so you know what’s going on, and the story is this, that when chimps are young, either males or female, the juveniles are under the domination of their mothers and the females meet with each other every so often, so any female can dominate any young independent of sex. I’ll give you some reading, about human societies, many what we call ‘primitive human societies’ have the same thing, that even the words for a young boy is the same as for a girl, that they’re not distinguished, only at some sort of puberty right do the boy–do the biological boys become socially constructed boys, in a sense. It was not so easy for the female to return to normal. The last thing he wants is for her to resist. She should be beaten, and they talk about this quite openly; 40% to 80% again in different surveys, 40% to 80% of wives agree that a beating is justified if a wife neglects household chores or is disobedient. If a husband gives a woman a direct order and she does not follow it, she gets beaten. It’s her duty to obey her husband and they describe it–the women talking to each other and talking to investigators describe it as selfish when she follows what she wants to do, which of course there is always conflict between what Person A wants to do and Person B, then they said, ‘I was selfish, I deserved a beating. A male, he has not much else to do, than feed and think about his part in the dominance. I’m angry that Yale has never given her an honorary degree even though she lives right here in Connecticut. in order to be able to see them she would put out bananas and they would come and get it and they would get used to her that way. And the northern group was somewhat larger but not a huge difference. He actually lived for a few months; his spine and his pelvis were protruding from outside the skin. Goliath is the one we talked about already, who by this time is an extremely old male with teeth worn down to the gums, so clearly not a threat to anybody, he was too old to be a threat, and Jomio, who had been his previous grooming partner, and had been watched for six years - they were buddies - and he’s part of the attacking party and he attacks Goliath just like any of the others. You can read about human primitive warfare as it has very much this similar character. Did somehow Jane Goodall’s treatment of these animal groups–they saw a big group in the beginning, maybe that wasn’t a natural group, maybe it was two different groups that came into–that sort of joined for the purpose of getting bananas and then they reverted to their prior hostility–separateness and hostility. The most obvious one is they get more territory and therefore they get more trees, more food. For instance, the difference between Bonobos and chimps has been ascribed to food density and the size of the parties, and so forth. The reason is that these groups fight each other. Because there’s males, the males fight for this dominance, the males get bigger than the females, and then they can coerce the females, and so I think–and that’s why you see all this – not only male on male violence but male on female violence, so I think the story does in the end fit back together, but the driving force seems to be the fight between the different groups of males, which require males."
721,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-3,"Throughout prehistoric, written, and recent history, human warfare has been commonplace. Nearly all societies engage in regular or periodic war. In many examples, human warfare has characteristics similar to chimpanzee war: an in-group fights with and kills members of the out-group. This information is not to be misinterpreted as either justifying human violence or considering it inevitable. When it comes to births and fecundity, though, humans are very different from the other great apes. Chimpanzees reproduce once every five to eight years; humans can give birth again within 18 months. It is likely that an increase in male contribution to child rearing allowed this greater fecundity.","Now I’ve been describing the intimate relationship between sex and violence within the chimpanzee social system. Here are just children or we would call them infants almost, 0 to 3 years. So deaths in infancy are 50–per year are 15 times as common as deaths in adulthood. All of them had other really identifiable causes. The killing is done because they are members of a group not because of any prior or particular conflict between individuals. Anthropologists tell us that primitive warfare has exactly the same characteristics. Either whatever you think of the chimp warfare and the causes of it you have to think that a lot of that is still causing human warfare, or you can say as many utopians do, that they’re different. They were just bashed to death in the head or the neck. This was not like one burial from one horrific incident, it was used over several generations. In the U.S. West, 86% of the Indian tribes went raiding or had to resist raids at least once a year. The Germans in the 19–before the Depression in the 1920s–were among the most civilized people on earth in science, and education, boom, they become savages almost immediately. Remember this is someone who is already a captive with his hands tied so there’s no immediate threat. Continuing, Vespucci talking, “The most astonishing thing about their wars and cruelty is that we could find no reason for them, since they have no property or lords, or kings, or desire for plunder, or lust to rule, which seems to me to be the causes of war and disorder.” It’s a very interesting passage, the Indians–Vespucci’s idea is that original sin is what causes this and then political–the sins that humans do have the lust for power, etc., Yanomamo villages are surrounded by abundant unoccupied territory. There is no example, no period which we can find out, where there’s a discontinuity between the chimpanzee behavior and our current behavior, and so again, I think whatever you think of what’s causing the chimpanzee war, you probably have to consider very much the same explanation for human war. Rather than having raids almost continuously as in a lot of primitive warfare, we have wars every 15 or 20 years or so in general between any two groups fighting each other. Humans are like chimpanzees, we’re quite intelligent, and we are capable–we have instinct, I believe that we have instincts for sure, you’ll see it come out in the most horrible ways and in some good ways, but it’s not that difficult to control. Demography is, of course, births and deaths; those are the two main things in demography. We have been talking about one of the main causes of human death on one side, and we find that there is a clear continuity between chimpanzees and humans. We separated from chimps about six million years ago, and I’ve shown you–this is another version of the deaths–don’t worry about it. So a small group struggling in its environment, very likely to go extinct; most of our sibling species went extinct, and I think with a very small role of the dice differently the line towards humans could easily have gone extinct. There may have been other human populations somewhere else that disappeared. You can read that the royal houses of Europe is where you’re all exposed to it. Again, the numbers and the times, some people say it was as late as 25,000 years ago that they migrated out. Dry land doesn’t produce the big fruiting trees that chimps depend on. She’s clearly being pretty happy about this, and I also said I would show you–this is two females doing the same thing. I mean the guys who took the picture obviously knew a lot more but you can tell that–so this is what I described–that the locals call hoka-hoka. Then intercourse must take place before ovulation. When you’re more dispersed, male/male competition has to be reduced. Where stable pairing becomes an evolutionarily advantage, the male putting resources into the pair are for evolutionary advantage."
722,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-4,"Hunter-gatherer populations were much less dense than later agriculturalists. The variety of their food supply protected them from crop failures and their sparseness reduced the spread of infectious diseases. Hunter-gatherers were healthier and worked less than early agriculturalists. Why didn’t their numbers increase up to the same level of Malthusian misery? Their numbers may have been limited by violence between groups. Agriculture is more work intense and offers a less varied diet. Populations seem to grow rapidly and then die out suddenly. Populations are subject to climatic- or disease-caused crop failure. But farming allows individuals to produce a surplus of food that can then be stolen by warrior tribes or military castes. The surplus allows for population growth, cities and stratified societies. The death rate, until perhaps the 1700s in Europe, is enormously high: only approximately a third of women survive to the end of their reproductive period. At this death rate, surviving women who are able to reproduce must have more than six children on average or the society goes extinct. All the great religions and cultures develop in this long period and all stress the requirement for high reproductive rates: “Be fruitful and multiply.”","As you may have noticed, the course has been proceeding somewhat historically. There is certainly not now and the question is, why?If you look where hunter-gatherers live now they–each small group, and the again the small group is the same size we’ve been talking about something like 40, are spread out over a very large area and they use that area to hunt in and to collect fruits and nuts, and whatever they can get from the trees. One study looked at more than 12,500 skeletons so we’re talking about a good scientific sample. Again, their burden of sickness is not severe, again compared to later populations; however parasites are always a problem. Worms–exactly and when they purge her that was what was inside that girl, all those worms. The tropical regions of the world, nothing like that; New Guinea I said, Borneo very sparsely populated, the Amazon, Sub-Saharan Africa vast open areas, so these are not situations of high population density, yet any village that you sit in is increasing its population. The next thing is diseases of the crops, that some fungus came by and wiped out your crops. That leaves the possibility of violent confrontation from one community to another. Well what is it that kills people in their middle years? The number of people, and when you invent agriculture, the number of people that can be supported on one plot of land grows up enormously. That’s not very healthy because each crop is missing something. And this is 1979 in–how far is Haiti from Miami? A hundred and fifty miles or something like that. If you look at women, consider this just a graph for women. Wait a minute, I’ve made this a better case, that’s of the–all that this graph shows is women that are alive in this period. The religious doctrines push it; there’s community sanctions; the cultures just developed in a way that–in order to increase fertility and any culture that doesn’t do that and doesn’t increase it successfully, they’re just not here anymore. Economically he would have to support not only the wife but the kid, and he didn’t want to have to support kids that weren’t his, so he engaged in the sex act because that was the fun part of it and–but at the last minute he pulls out and spills his seed upon the ground. At that–well if she gets pregnant, she’s pregnant for nine months. The mode for Norway was 10 children and it goes out to 18, which was the record that someone here knew. Now, just as long as I’ve got this slide up there, look what changes. They marry fairly early, not extremely early but fairly early. It’s clearly land availability had something to do with it. As soon as the children will have to disperse and not anymore be of some sort of support to you, or some part of your group, fertility comes back down. If it was more than three years, only 19% of the children died. You’ve all heard of this, lactation amenorrhea, and many, many cultures don’t leave–I mean in our culture a woman can breastfeed a little bit or long, it’s totally up to the individual. By that mechanism, primarily by the lactation amenorrhea, the birth interval among ! This is the kind of–I talked about Nomads and people that have–fairly conscious–they’re probably are aware that this is limiting the births and it’s something that they want to do. We see this in the evolution of cultures, I mean just as we evolve biologically, of course evolve culturally, that cultures may–will pick up a behavioral pattern for who knows what reason, and they may have no clue what it’s ‘real’ as we see it, it’s ‘real’ purpose is, in this case to space births apart they have some kind of cultural story about it and it doesn’t matter whether that cultural story has any degree of reality. Very often this is when your daughter has her first child."
723,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-5,"In addition to cultural controls acting to maximize fertility, there are important, and often competing, interests of individual families to limit fertility. Unwanted births are dealt with by infanticide in many cultures. Additionally, fertility is regularly controlled by limiting marriage within a culture. Another very important factor in population growth, especially in the tropics, is food availability. Heavy rains in the tropics wash nutrients away, leaving deficient soils. Much of Africa is either too dry or too wet. Africa was, until recently, not densely populated. Since land was available and because more children meant more security and power, a culture evolved that emphasized high fertility, justified by the need for descendants to pacify ancestors. Sub-Saharan (tropical) Africa has the highest birth rates in the world. As an example, Niger, just south of the Sahara desert has a fertility rate of almost eight children per woman while, in the Mediterranean zone, Morocco, just north of the Sahara, but also a Sunni Muslim country, has a rate of only 3.3 children per woman.","I see this is largely, but of course not exclusively a female class, and I know that’s because of the reputation of the class as being very tough on men. That the baby comes totally from the woman’s substance and men just have to water it occasionally. They have marriages but the first copulation has to between husband and wife because that plants the seed, and it’s very important that the seed belong to the husband. Now this is not just this cultural–just dreaming stuff up, this has real empirical basis and the Barre say, ‘look it’s obvious, women grow fat during the pregnancy, while men they grow thin from all their work,’ so they have good reasons for believing what they do. Some thought it was all woman, some thought it was all male, and they just had no idea. The theory being that most of the things that people are doing have some role in helping them in a difficult world. Because of that, the husband does not sleep in the hut with his wife and children but sleeps in the men’s hut. It’s a male bonding sort of thing rather than a male/female bonding sort of thing. She has to figure out of way of resuming sexual intercourse but not get pregnant. Even today, this story of the dominant older males getting the most sex has by no means disappeared. but women still get pregnant and very often they or their families decide that they can’t have these children. In Western culture it’s certainly not unknown, the founding myth of Jewish people? What is the founding myth of the Roman people? The kings of old required that all men marry by the age of 19 and all women marry by the age of 14. China now wants to use it to decrease the population, but it’s the same idea that control in one way or another is important for every society. The tropics generally have low agricultural productivity. This is the–just a general map of Africa and what you see is, this is very standard, here is the equator and–I’m sorry here is–no this is the equator up here, so what you have is in Sub-Saharan Africa, well in all of Africa, you have in the center a rain forest. How many of you are aware of that, that the tropics are not good for farming? All you Forestry guys ought to be aware of this. One is by mountains being eroded down, that the mountains erode. Well one end of the fungus is attached to the decaying leaves and other stuff that falls down. They die, your means of recycling nutrients is gone; the soil has very little nutrients itself. They take care of their–they have exports which they exchange for food from better regions. You look all over the pre-modern world and of course you know it’s not gone in the modern world, slavery is a very big thing and a very big part of what happens to population. We’ll talk a little bit about that later. Slavery is a response to under population. Midwest, upper Midwest, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota. All of this really adds up and geography counts and people have to adapt to the geography. You compare this to Mali and this is the number of women that don’t want any more children, and I think the final there is 8.6 or something, an enormous difference. It’s getting there and so you say, oh well that’s why Morocco–Moroccan’s want and have fewer children because they have a better situation with infant mortality, but then you look at Niger and not–it’s not as good as Morocco but it’s still come down quite a bit and since then it’s come down further. North Africa is a different story; South Africa we have the European settlement, that’s another different story, but the bulk of Central Africa to some degree fits this. In general, we’re talking about those parts in Africa where it’s hard to stay alive, it’s hard to get a population going that we’re–that places traditionally under populated and just now with Western medicine are the population rates coming up to where you might consider it crowded. It’s very pronounced in Africa but not in any sense unique. And then they’re taking up–so they’re not disturbed, by that time they’re ready, they don’t have their flesh anymore, they’re ready to leave, so they take them to these big cliffs overlooking the village, and there’s caves, natural caves in the cliff, and the dead bodies are brought up there to sit, and look down over the village, they’re not very far away."
724,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-6,"In many regions, the central cultural idea is that of a lineage, a family and its line of male ancestors and descendants. The prime duty in these cultures is to keep the lineage going. Religion is small scale with the ancestors performing many of the functions of gods. Denser populations and larger political entities lead to large-scale religion where conformity is stressed and cultural rules are codified in a book and not subject to discussion with the ancestors. In pre-modern Sub-Saharan Africa, land was not limiting, so a maximum number of children was desired. Neither monogamy nor chastity were valued as much as fertility. Families were not nuclear; husbands and wives did not engage in many activities together; children were often raised by other members of the village and women had the responsibility for economic support of the children. In many areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, farming is the work of women. Women often prefer men with resources which leads to polygamy. Women in polygamous relationships form support groups for each other and men enjoy the fruits of several women’s labor and children. In temperate regions, the land eventually fills up and the dangers of overpopulation come to the fore. Peasants are miserably poor. Massive epidemics (the Black Death, 1347 and onward) and wars (the Catholic-Protestant wars, 1562-1648) can kill a third of the population.","Last time we started talking about tropical places where high productivity agriculture is generally just not possible. As I showed you last time, Africa really is different than the rest of the world. I showed statistics comparing Morocco on the north coast of Africa, included in the Mediterranean cultural zone. It probably starts with the agriculture and then goes into other fields. Because it’s your own–the gods are in a sense your own ancestors, people that you knew, people that you talk too, they stay more close to you after they die. The people are thinking it over; it’s a hot topic. If this discussion with the ancestors, as they call the traditional religion, would be hostile to the introduction of family planning because elsewhere in the world of course the more conservative the more–it doesn’t depend on the individual religion, a particular religion as I have said and will say again, but it does depend on the religiosity of the person. He asked the village head man–one of the anthropologists–to inquire of the spirits how many children should a family have; a simple question. That was a pretty clear answer; there was no futzing around with that one. If a problem crops up and the child is sick then money is everything. This contact with the ancestors seems quite natural. Our men have turned to vegetables; they leave home early and come back intoxicated. Again, the biological parentage of the child is less important. The legal father accepts the child; the community accepts the child. She got together a focus group of women to discuss this issue. It’s a long thing, I’ll just tell you a little bit from it, and so Susan says, “So sometimes women were unfaithful,” pretending a Western perspective and the women said, “Yes being unfaithful started a long time ago,” another woman: “Long ago the older woman, the elder women, would tell us that the only time you could sleep with another man was if your husband was not able to make you pregnant, but it’s not that way anymore.” Just that idea of a tight-knit family, exclusive in many ways, is just not a common sort of thing. As in Africa, the women did most of the farming, they had a kind of slash and burn agriculture also, and the women did most of the farming. ”Given that women are doing the work in many cultures, they are very valuable, and so bride price comes from this idea that–in some sense you’re buying a woman and she is going to work for you and there is a very rough generalization that in cultures where the women do the work, and the farming work especially, the man–the bride price will go from the man to the woman’s family. In Sub-Saharan Africa, and this is 1989 data, in different places 12% to 38% of the African men are in polygamous marriages. If they’re limited to two and 50% is a max, those places where polygamy is 38% of the men, means that most of the women are in polygamists relationships. Now to contrast this whole system to that–in the temperate zones; agriculture is much more productive in the temperate zones. In the classic ages, up through Rome, through the whole Roman Empire, the population of the Mediterranean world was clearly increasing; whatever data we have always points to that. This is a period of the tremendous dominance of the church. The civil authorities controlled what was left of the land, the kings and so forth, and it turns out that the serfs on the civil land had somewhat better conditions, somewhat more rights than on church lands. The plague spread throughout Europe killing millions and millions of people. And people would whip themselves, they’re called the flagellants and–have any of you seen ? Now that’s–not everybody had to agree that that was the seminal event that caused the renaissance in some–nothing is that simple, but it clearly was one of the major things that one has to consider in describing why did the Renaissance happen. One of the great French historians, George Huppert has studied a village in France in the 1600s, and there’s a village about 500 to 700 people. “ Maybe the daughter of–daughters of transient artisans or laborers, and again, as we saw in the under populated areas of New Guinea, when a man died leaving a wife, no time was wasted."
725,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-7,"European populations grew only slowly during the period 1200-1700; factors include disease and wars. Human feces and rotting animal remains were not sequestered and often contaminated drinking water. Cities were so filthy that more people died in them than were born. About a third of children died in infancy, many from abandonment and lack of care during wet-nursing. Children that survived were subjected to harsh discipline to control their tendency to sin. Ineffective and even harmful treatments, like blood-letting, were all that medicine could offer. Starting with Newton’s (1687) and the Enlightenment (eighteenth century), scientific attitudes began replacing religious ones: the biological and physical world became objects of study. Sanitation, hygiene and public health improved. Inoculation and vaccination were developed. The Industrial Revolution began. As death rates fell, population rose. While most believe that an increasing population is good, Malthus worries that population can grow faster than the food supply, trapping people in subsistence misery.","Did I tell you the story when one of my friends was offered–to buy from me? The reasons for this we had discussed a little bit. In 1665, there was a great plague in London, one of those that I’ve showed you there and that’s the one that–written about by  author, Daniel Dafoe. In terms of the waste in the streets, it wasn’t just feces but everything else was just dumped into the streets. In a place like that, presumably the seed of the Western religions, the feces were 50 feet deep and had been collecting since the destruction of the second temple by the Romans. Basically everyone had malaria, and malaria was endemic there. We have one professor of medieval history who gives a great lecture and if he ever gives it as a public lecture that I’ve seen him give. All these are Roman creations, so the Romans very careful, as much as they could in a place like that with personal hygiene. Good question, was the water likely to make them sick? In 1646, the rich and very progressive town of Leiden in the Netherlands, Leiden was one of the most advanced places in Europe, limited the working day for children to 14 hours, whether the law was obeyed or not we don’t know, but children could not do that. That was a standard procedure; let the blood flow because that gets rid of the evil humors. In three months this guy loses 100 pounds. Does anybody have the scientific cast of mind that, ‘well I have a theory and I’m applying that theory, and, oh my, it’s not working, so maybe my theory is wrong.’ Your mother tells you that all the time, because you wash your hands first which they didn’t do, but even then you eat with a knife and fork, which your mother has–or your dishwasher has–cleaned very nicely. And the idea was that the stuff that you eat are animals and plants, they’re God’s creations, and that by using a fork she had set herself up above God’s creation and the quote is, “To touch meat with a fork was impiously to declare that God’s creatures were not worthy of being touched by human hands.” Original sin is the view of human nature. If you’re taught when you’re young, and your parents believe, that the most moral thing is that you must be obedient, you must not have a will of your own; this leads you to believe that authoritarian political structures are the normal and right way that humans should be governed. Jonathan Edwards, for whom one of the Yale Colleges is named and he was President of Princeton, he was not President of Yale; once I said he was I was wrong. We have some centuries of this period and you can go back to maybe the fall of the Roman Empire when really learning about reality in the West kind of stopped with the fall of Rome, so you have more than 1,000 years where sort of no intellectual progress with respect to reality is made. Maybe we many, many times know what the causes are. That is such a tremendous change in life that there’s nothing else as important. You may remember Copernicus had already said that things didn’t go around the earth but they went around the sun that was older. The moon around the earth, the earth around the sun, the planets around all of these sorts of things. Just a new kind of way of dealing with disease that just hadn’t been seen before, and so what did they find?They found that, in Turkey, that they were inoculating people, and what inoculation is, the early form–they take someone that has the disease; they take pus from the disease–what is pus? Local governments started–I’ll tell you more about smallpox in a couple of minutes. The previous idea was that of a hierarchical system with God appointing kings being–ruling over nobility and then everyone else must obey up this chain. The sun and the earth, the earth and the moon, everything acts by the same rules, there is no need for some sort of central sentient coordinator of all this, but each individual planet, each individual body, all bodies, apples, working by their own laws, by the same laws as everyone else the universe works beautifully. The king at that time was doing something right because people were able to stay alive. He believed that there was no doubt that population increases geometrically, or exponentially as we say, that means a certain percent a year. He was a strong conservative in that sense."
726,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-8,"Prior to Malthus, population growth was seen as good for the power and wealth of a country. The rapid population growth of America was crucial in expelling England (via the Revolution) and France (via the Louisiana Purchase) from the US. But in fact, the numbers of the poor were growing in Europe in the 1700s. Malthus argued that poverty was due to an imbalance between people and resources; since population could rise very fast, it could always outstrip any gains in productivity. He did not anticipate an exponential increase in production or a voluntary decrease in fertility. However, Malthus’ thinking is still important because high population levels and environmental limitations are in fact problematic today. By the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, mortality was falling in Europe and this caused a population explosion. The productivity gains of the Industrial Revolution were nearly balanced by the increased population; per capita income of the working classes was not much improved. Fertility didn’t drop until late in the nineteenth century; per capita income started to grow rapidly. The reason for the fertility decline is not well explained by declining mortality or rising standard of living or any other socioeconomic factor. The mortality and later fertility drop is called the Demographic Transition. The extension of lifespan and the freedom from continual childbearing and child rearing is one of the most important changes ever in what it means to be a human.","Last time–so last time we discussed two factors that limited–that retarded and limited your progress. And the realization of American increase in numbers and therefore increase in power was very important in the history of that time. Napoleon got the message immediately; there was no way that France was going to be able to hold Louisiana against American objections. What they didn’t realize is one of the things that I’m trying to get across in this class, that that system works for a situation where you have no limitation on land or resources. Kind of an obvious question; again not the first time that this question had been asked. Again, in the spirit of the Enlightenment, science was the leading source of intellectual new ideas and natural history was going on–was getting going at that time, studying of plants and animals in their natural habitats, just like all your TAs for this course. That was the great achievement of Malthus–and all this interest in what is the cause of poverty, and there were many other things. In the strongest statement of this, and he went through many editions with many different statements, but in the strongest statement economic progress is basically impossible; looked at from the point of view of per capita income, the living standards of the average person. Nevertheless, even though there was more food around poverty was growing, and that was also very clear at the time. All people do some kind of work and the pie grows with each person some–the pie grows to a certain degree and the question is how much does the pie grow?For instance again, in the United States at the time, we had these vast lands to the west where we were killing or had killed the Indians and they were very few of them anyway, so that allowed each new person–so as the population grows–again when you have no limitation of resources–a new family is living on the frontier, the frontier becomes crowded. American population was growing very fast; they were having lots of kids, lots of immigrants, where do the new people go? The population increases, the gross economy increases, and the per capita standard of living does not decrease because this guy has the same amount of resources as the previous generation had. I’m watching for a while and I’m skeptical but the socks seemed okay. What other resources and who gets to utilize them and so forth. Now of course we realize we do have to worry about the limits of the environment. Is Malthus right not in the extreme but in the reality that you can–even in very dense populations–you can have some economic growth, but would the people be better off if they had less–a lower population? 5% of the population dies every year is kind of a maximum that humans can sustain. More than that and you have a lower E; your population goes out of existence. This is just before the Reformation for instance, 60 to 80 hours. In England, buying power started falling in the 1500s and didn’t recover to that level until well into the nineteenth century. Forests did not increase, in fact were cut down to have more land for agriculture, so wood becomes scarce for housing, for heating, for heating houses, for building houses and so forth. When he was alive he was very controversial and it really wasn’t until the Irish potato famine, about which you have read, and massive numbers of people died for lack of resources, a bug killing the potatoes. Any of you that watch television know that John Adams and his wife Abigail went to Europe about that time, I think it was 1782, and she especially was distressed at the French people’s “feeble commitment to family life,” exemplified by the French families only having three or four children rather than the eight or ten that you were supposed to have. The big question in demography, since this was noticed a long time ago, what cause this change? Now–it wasn’t important at that time, it wasn’t considered to be important, but of course France is a totally Catholic country and so why should a Catholic country be the first one and way ahead of everyone else to reduce its birthrate?Historians have come up with all–we don’t know the answer, let me tell you that right out. In Mexico and Taiwan the mortality was 35  and you don’t keep your society alive less than that, and modern Japan would be at this time be about 5 and you see that–the range is what you actually see is this whole range, anywhere in that range of what mortality levels people actually achieve can be the range at which fertility starts to fall. They have to be somewhere in the–between $700 and $800 dollars in income. So once fertility starts dropping per capita income does start rising. Anything is for guessing, in everything that you can measure about Europe, changes in what we call monotonic in a single direction."
727,molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,mcdb-150,lecture-9,"Prior to the Demographic Transition, fertility in northwestern Europe was controlled by limiting marriage. Marriage was regulated by landowners and the churches, and was not allowed unless a man had accumulated the resources necessary to support a family. Long periods of being landless, a servant, or an apprentice, precluded marriage. Once married, there was no control of fertility. But, only about half of adults were married at any given time, so fertility was about half of what it might have been. Eventually, contraception was accepted and fertility within marriage fell. Society no longer needed to control marriage so tightly and marriage rates rose dramatically. The options of marriage, sex and childbearing passed from community control to individual control. The fertility decline occurred very rapidly in Europe, mostly between 1870 and 1930. It has been difficult to prove a socioeconomic basis for the decline. The largest study, The Princeton European Fertility Project, argued that cultural transmission of new social norms was crucial. The Demographic Transition encompassed a ten-fold increase in population and a three-fold increase in life expectancy. It drastically changed the human experience of life.","We’re discussing the fertility transition and we’ve talked that prior to the fertility transition there was control of fertility, but it was at a very high level. I want to just describe a little bit about what the story was in Europe, exactly how fertility was controlled. However, once in marriage, the children just flowed. The end result of all this is that it took many, many years to establish a sufficient economic base so that the society would allow you to get married. But in England taking a reasonable number, these controls of marriage cut the birthrate in half. What did it feel like to the people involved in this? I suspect a fair number of you have heard this quote. Young men of course wanted to get married, couldn’t until they were old, and we’ve talked about that situation in Africa where the bride price is very high, the old men control the bride price, they don’t allow the young men to get married until there’s almost a revolution. This is an aside, but with respect to the bride price, we hear a lot about older men marrying or having sex with younger women. There was an intellectual terrorization of the people, they feared legal prosecution. I said, “Mrs. Jacobs said a funny thing to me, she said my ring was lovely,” her marriage ring, “but she hoped I didn’t start a family and he should wear a raincoat. The reason given by the woman is not any moral consideration, no life–that’s not the consideration, but it’s a medical thing, it’s just at that time the methods since it was illegal, and if you didn’t–even if you went to a practitioner it was very, very dangerous but the kinds of things that women actually used on themselves were so incredibly dangerous, so the reason she’s not having an abortion is that she doesn’t want to ruin herself in the medical sort of way. Sicily, like all the rest of the world, is changing and growing up. In China–we’re going to talk about China later–do you know what the rate of–the Americans complain and Chinese too to some degree about the one child policy and the excess of female – of males–that there aren’t enough girls to get married and this is going to cause incredible social disruption. The Eastern Europe, which was in a rather different mold, had a higher marriage rate. Guess now who has the lowest marriage rate? That the men are very close to their mother and get married either very late or don’t get married at all. The technology was borrowed from something else. The string, like a modern IUD, whereas a string hangs out and you can pull it down. Here–you didn’t–this wasn’t in your reading this particular graph. One that’s hard to figure out but there was, for some reason, various groups started their fertility decline and we’ll talk about various theories of that, but once it became–whereas everyone else was horrified about whatever they say, it was rich people, it was outcast people. Like in Germany they pass the premiership back and forth between them. But, education also gives you a window on the world and makes you more open to new ideas, a greater sense of agency that you can talk back to your husband or your mother-in-law, and so forth, so a lot of the variables–you can’t decide is this an economic variable or a social variable? I just want to summarize–we spent a lot of time on this demographic transition and it’s theory, and a lot of reading–and every year students say, ‘oh I hated that part of the course,’ but it is in a sense the most–for the modern times it’s the most important part of the course because everything else that you read, every understanding of the what’s happening now in developing countries is based on this stuff, either agrees with it or disagrees with it, or uses the same methodology or very self consciously tries to use a different methodology, this is the foundation of the fields. The numbers of human beings, the number of people that we now are able to keep alive is ten times larger, everyday it gets bigger, but last time I counted ten times larger than what we think the population was back then. I don’t know the answer; I don’t think it has been discovered; investigated, a great term paper."
728,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-10,"The lecture focuses on the question of the metaphysical key to personal identity. What does it mean for a person that presently exists to be the very same person in the future? The first approach to answering this question is the “soul theory,” that is, the key to being the same person is having the same soul. Difficulties with that approach are then discussed, independent of the question whether souls exist or not.","At the end of last class, I suggested that from here on out I’m going to be assuming that there is no soul. I’m going to be discussing the issues that we turn to hereafter from the perspective of the physicalist, the person who says that a person is basically just a fancy body — a body that can do certain special tricks, a body that can function in certain ways that we associate with being a person, a body that can P-function, as we put it. Let’s suppose that the person alive in 2050 is bald and bent over, has no beard. Just so it doesn’t look too much like the locomotive. And we’re walking along, we’re walking along, we’re walking along. I agree, of course, that a locomotive is not the same thing as a caboose. Rather, initially when we started our walk, I pointed to a caboose, but by pointing to the caboose, I picked out a train. Suppose, as we’re taking our walk, part of the train isn’t visible. Now again, it’s important not to misunderstand that question. I mean to be talking about an entire train. By 2006, it had a lot of dents, 2006, when it finally died. But when I talk about that car, I’m picking not just the current slice or the current stage of the car, but the entire extended-through-time object. When I say, “That’s the very same car I’ve had for 16 years,” I mean, “Think of the object extended through time that I’m picking out by pointing to the current slice. Is the space-time worm that makes up this car the same space-time worm as the one that made up my car? And the answer, not that there aren’t puzzles about it, but the answer is roughly, “It’s the very same car if it’s the very same hunk of metal and plastic and wires. The glue, the key to identity across time for cars, is being the same hunk of stuff. I just want to flag the thought that you can be the very same hunk of stuff, even if some of the constituent atoms have changed along the way. We’ll call him “Mr. X.”  We ask, “Is that the same person or not?” I’m asking, I’m saying, “Look, when you look at the current stage, the current person slice and think about the entire extended-through-time entity, the person that makes up Shelly Kagan, or that is Shelly Kagan, is that the very same person as the extended-through-time person that you got in mind when you point to the Mr. X 2050?”The stages are obviously different. And so, what we’d like to know is, well, what does it take for two person stages to make up or be part of the very same extended-through-time person? The metaphysical key to personal identity is having the very same soul. The key to personal identity, according to the soul view, is having the very same soul. And there’d be no way at all that you could possibly tell."
729,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-11,"Two more views regarding the metaphysical key to personal identity are discussed: the body view and the personality view. According to the body view, an individual is identified in terms of his or her physical body. According to the personality view, an individual is identified by his or her unique set of beliefs, desires, memories, goals, and so on.","Last time, we turned to the question of what the metaphysical key to personal identity might be. The first approach to this that we considered was the soul theory of personal identity: the key to being the same person is having the same soul. And this is a — There’s a logical distinction here that’s worth drawing. Now, as it turns out, that appearance is deceptive. According to the body theory, the answer is — turns on the question, “Well, is this the same body as the lump of flesh and bone that was here last week?” Yes, I am, because it’s the very same body. That’s what it looks like at first glance. And he cleans all the pieces and buffs them and polishes them and then reassembles the whole thing. When I think about the tower case, I do find myself inclined to say, with van Inwagen, that’s not the tower my son built. Now, all I can do is invite you to think about these two cases and ask yourself, what should we say here? And then of course, we’d have to further investigate whether when you reassemble a body, is it more like the watch case or is it more like the tower case?I just have to confess, I don’t know what the best thing to say about these cases is. So I think I previously talked about the steering wheel in my car. There can be changes in your body that are compatible with it still being the same body. We find examples of this thought, that the brain is the key, in odd places. It is possible that he could have been alive and practicing law somewhere. Because of course we think, look, lose a hand, the guy could still be alive. Suppose we rip out my heart and put Jones’ heart in here. And then I’m inclined to think the best version of the body view is the brain view. And with the body view, when I started arguing a few moments ago that the best version of the body view was the brain view, why did that seem plausible? But for all that, the key to the same person could have to do with the personality rather than the sameness of bodies. Could there be some way to get sameness of personality while not having sameness of body? But at least it allows you to see how the body and the personality could come apart. We can still say the reason that we’ve got the same personality in the normal case, is there’s some physical explanation of what houses the personality. And the personality theory, the key to personal identity is having the very same personality. But those things are constantly changing. Well, the answer presumably is going to be that the best version of the personality theory doesn’t require item for item having the very same beliefs, memories, desires, and so forth. We can still say it’s the same personality, the same evolving personality, so long as there’s a pattern of overlap and continuity. So I want to invite you to keep that extra little something in mind when we tell the stories, which we won’t get to until next time, when we tell the stories next time, and I say, “Okay, who do you want to be tortured, this person or that person?”"
730,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-12,The lecture focuses on the problems directly related to the personality theory as key to personal identity. The theory states that a person retains his or her individuality so long as he or she has the same ongoing personality. The main objection raised to this claim is the problem of duplication. The lecture explores cases in which the same personality has been transferred or exported to multiple bodies.,"We’ve distinguished three different views as to the secret or key to personal identity across time. Again, just to remind you, in order to get the intuitions actually flowing, what I’m going to do once I’ve separated the body and the personality this way, is torture one of the end products. And I’m going to hook you up to my machines and swap your minds. Then when you wake up, you will wake up in Linda’s body.” This has got my personality, my memories of growing up in Chicago, becoming a philosopher, my thoughts about what I want to have happen to my children, my fears about how I’m going to explain what’s going on to my wife. After I give you amnesia, before I torture you, I will drive you insane and make you believe that you’re Linda. This is Shelly Kagan’s body and that suggests if I don’t want this to be tortured, it’s because I believe in the body theory of personal identity. It’s still the same central processing unit, or so it seems to me. So the thought is, look, over here we’ve got Shelly Kagan’s body with Linda’s personality. Or making sure that the person who’s thinking to yourself, “I’m Shelly Kagan” or whatever your name is, that “I’m in pain.” You spin the story another way, and I follow the personality. And then become body theorists, if there are no souls. He doesn’t remember being crowned emperor. He’s just got Napoleon’s personality through and through. To have the genuine memory, he has to have been crowned emperor. The body of Napoleon is not this body and to be Napoleon, you’ve got to have Napoleon’s body. Some memory that Napoleon never wrote down in his diaries. This guy remembers things that Napoleon would remember. That’s what the personality theory should say and I said it doesn’t seem like a crazy thing to say if we only had the guy in New York. People can’t be in two places at the same time. New York dude and Michigan dude are a single person, Napoleon, who is bilocated. All right, saying that Napoleon is in Michigan but not New York doesn’t seem very attractive. That seems to me to be the least unattractive of the options we’ve got available. They should say we were simplifying unduly. Now, if we say that, if we throw in the no branching clause, then we’re able to say, look, in the original story I was telling, where there was the Michigan guy who had Napoleon’s personality but no New York guy, that really would be Napoleon, because it would have the same personality with no competitor. But in the case where we’ve got branching, where we’ve got somebody with Napoleon’s personality both in Michigan and New York, that violates the no branching rule, and we just have to say nobody’s Napoleon in that case. He’s got all sorts of memories of his childhood. We can’t conclude that until we know that there aren’t any competitors, that there isn’t anybody else right now who also has the same personality. If I’m the only one around today who’s got Shelly Kagan’s personality, then I’m the same person as the person who was lecturing to you on Tuesday."
731,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-13,"The personality theory is revised to state that the key to personal identity is having the same personality provided that there is no branching, that is, provided there is no transfer or duplication of the same personality from one body to another. Similar “no branching” requirements are added to the other theories as well. At the end of class, Professor Kagan suggests a shift from thinking about the survival of the soul in terms of “what does it take to survive?” to “what is it that matters in survival?”","Let me start by reviewing the problem that we were considering last week. Given the no branching view, the no branching rule, we can say, in the ordinary case, look, there really wasn’t anybody imprinted with my memories and desires in Michigan. Well, I’ve got Shelly Kagan’s personality. So although the personality with no branching rule avoids the problem of what to say about duplicates, by saying when there’s branching, neither of them is Shelly Kagan, the branching rule itself seems very counter-intuitive. Personalities don’t actually split either, right? You’ll recall that when we talked about the body view, I said the best version of the body view doesn’t require the entire body, to be the same body, but the brain. And indeed, it doesn’t seem as though we have to require the entire brain, just enough of the brain, however much that turns out, to house personality, memories and so forth. Well, you had some living people, but they had very rare brain diseases and their brain suddenly liquefied. All right, so here we’ve got Shelly Kagan. Smith’s torso with the right half of Shelly Kagan’s brain, let’s call him Righty. They both think they’re Shelly Kagan, and so forth and so on. We could say Lefty is Shelly Kagan and Righty is not. But it’s also true that Righty’s got half of Shelly Kagan’s brain and that seems good enough. So there’s no reason to say that Lefty is Shelly Kagan and Righty isn’t. Although it’s true that we now have two people, Lefty and Righty, each of whom has half of Shelly Kagan’s brain, and all of Shelly Kagan’s memories, for whatever that’s worth, neither of them is Shelly Kagan. Follow the body, in particular follow the brain. So the very same case raises the very same problem for both the body view and the personality view. What should a soul theorist say about the fission case? After all, the problem that fission raises for the personality theory, in a nutshell, is that personalities can split, they can branch. But how can we say that if we accept the soul theory? He didn’t actually convince me of that, but suppose we thought souls are simple, and we think simple things can’t split. Interestingly, and somewhat more surprisingly, looking at it from the inside, we won’t be able to tell either. So as I say, the soul theory can at least give us an answer that avoids the no branching rule. If souls are simples and simples can’t split, there’s no possibility of having two things with a relevant soul. Whatever it was, fill in your favorite blank, fill in the blank in your favorite way. Of course, that soul won’t remember being Shelly Kagan. It won’t have any memories of its prior life. Then who cares that it’s me?If you can feel the force of that thought, then you’re seeing how the question “Will I survive?”"
732,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-14,"The suggestion is made that what matters in survival is the future existence of someone with a personality similar to one’s own. Professor Kagan then turns to the question, “what is it to die?”. In answering this question, attention is first drawn to the bodily and mental functions that are crucial in defining the moment of death.","At the end of last class, I began to raise the question as to whether or not we should distinguish two questions that we would normally be inclined to run together. But we can think of cases in which I would survive, but I don’t have that extra thing, and so I wouldn’t have everything that matters to me. A new set of memories, new set of desires, new set of beliefs. I have a certain set of desires about wanting to finish my book in philosophy and so forth. And in the Methuselah case, I’ve stipulated, it ends up not being very much like me at all. Turns out I’m not going to survive tonight. What I care about is whether there’ll be somebody that’s similar to me in the right way in terms of my personality. There won’t be anything that’s me afterwards. And so a person is just a -functioning body, whether you emphasize the body side there or the personality side of that equation. It functions for a while before the -functioning begins. Well, the natural suggestion is to say I died here. In the normal case, I die when my body stops functioning, in terms of the body functions. Pretty clearly then, on the personality theory, I don’t exist at Phase C. That’s why it’s natural to point to the moment of star when we say that’s when my death occurs. Here’s the period back here, A, where the body’s been functioning, but the personality hasn’t started yet. End of D. When does the personality functioning stop? Star one says death occurs when personality stops functioning. And it seems that if we accept the body view, we have to say being a person is not an essential property of being something like me. Notice that if you accept this account of what the body view should say about when death is, my death is when I cease to be alive. On the body view, it could still be me without being a person at all. Nothing exists with my beliefs, memories, desires, fears, values, goals, ambitions. Because if I just am my body, then well, I’m just my body. There’s going to be some Phase A like that. Of course, if we take the version of the body view that what I am, essentially — the crucial body part — is my brain, then we really would have to subdivide A into two parts: early A and late A. In very, very early A, the brain hasn’t even developed yet. If we want to worry about when, if ever, is an abortion justified, it might be worth getting clear on, when do creatures like us start? Well, if we take the personality theory, we have to say, my body’s still alive, but I’m not still alive. But of course, there’s nothing wrong about taking my heart, even though I still exist. But having gestured toward them, I want to put them aside."
733,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-15,"The lecture explores the question of the state of being dead. Even though the most logical claim seems to be that when a person stops P-functioning he or she is dead, a more careful consideration must allow for exceptions, such as when one is asleep or in a coma. Professor Kagan then suggests that on some level nobody believes that he or she is going to die. As a case in point, he takes Tolstoy’s famous character Ivan Ilych.","Last time we ended with the following puzzle or question. It can’t just be a matter of not -functioning. They were only temporarily not -functioning, just like we are temporarily not -functioning when we’re asleep. And to be dead then, is to be unable to engage in -functioning. It’s — When you’re dead, your brain is broken. Look, when somebody’s asleep, we need to do something to, in effect, wake them up, something to turn the functioning back on. Just like we don’t feel comfortable saying that the — I suppose we could do this with a fruit fly. In effect, from the physicalist point of view, although death is unique because it comes at the end of this lifetime of various sorts of functions, there’s nothing especially puzzling, nothing especially mysterious, nothing especially unusual or hard to grasp about it. But there are a handful of claims that people make about death suggesting that they think, and they think we all think, that death is mysterious or unique or hard to comprehend. Each one of us has to think about this from the first person perspective or something like that. And then, well, and then there is no “and more.” There’s nothing to describe, nothing to imagine. No mystery about what it’s like to be a cell phone. Well, should we conclude therefore, given that we’ve got the premise, “If you can’t picture it or imagine it, then you can’t believe in it,” since I’ve just said, look, you can’t imagine being dead, but that’s not due to any failure of imagination, that’s because there’s nothing there to imagine or picture. From the mere fact that you can’t picture from the inside what it’s like to be dead, it doesn’t follow that nobody believes they’re going to die. So even if it were true that belief requires picturing, and even if were true that you can’t picture being dead from the inside, it wouldn’t follow that you can’t believe you’re going to die. From which it follows, the argument goes, that I don’t really believe I’ll ever be dead. Freud says, this is, I’m quoting from one of the Walter Kaufman essays that you’ll be reading, called “Death.” When you try to imagine your being dead, you smuggle yourself back in as a spectator. All right, I’ve smuggled myself in as a spectator. If Freud’s argument for death, that is to say, none of us believe we’re going to die, was any good, the argument that none of us believe meetings ever take place without us would have to work as well. Are you looking at the picture from a certain point of view?Suppose I hold up a photograph of a beach with nobody on it. So I think the Freudian argument just fails. If you would have asked him “Are you mortal?” That’s the question we have to turn to next time."
734,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-16,"Professor Kagan puts forward the claim that Tolstoy’s character Ivan Ilych is quite the typical man in terms of his views on mortality. All of his life he has known that death is imminent but has never really believed it. When he suddenly falls ill and is about to die, the fact of his mortality shocks him. In trying to further access how people think about death, Professor Kagan explores the claim that “we all die alone,” presents a variety of arguments against it and ends by considering whether the primary badness of death could lie in the effects on those who are left behind.","— Tolstoy’s Ivan Ilyich is surprised to discover that he’s going to die. But when he finally gets ill and comes up to the fact of his mortality, that his body is going to sicken and eventually die, the fact of his mortality seems to shock him, seems to surprise him. We might say, on one level he believes that he was mortal. Now, I take it that we find Ivan Ilyich a perfectly believable example. Or, at the very least, many of us are in his situation. They might be, for example, in an accident, and come close to being killed, but walk away without a scratch. It’s something that they now really truly do believe. Let me turn now to a different claim that sometimes gets made about death. It seems to say something important about the nature of death. When people say, “You know, everyone dies alone,” you’re supposed to be gaining some deep insight into the nature of death. I put these conditions down because, of course, what I want to suggest is although the sentence “everyone dies alone,” the claim that everyone dies alone, is one of these things that people say, they’re not really thinking very hard about what they mean by it. But at least there’d be something interesting there. We all know full well that sometimes people die in the presence of others. Well, that’s an interesting claim, if it’s true, but it’s not true. Walking is something you can do with others, in the sense that it can be a joint activity, a joint undertaking. Somebody else could play the second violin part for me. It seems to me rather a long distance from the thought, “nobody can die for me, nobody can take my part,” to the claim, “everybody dies alone.” I am the only one who can undergo my death”? But maybe I’ve just been flatfooted here in thinking that this is some sort of claim about not being with others, or things I do by myself. Is that true of all of us?Remember, we’re looking for a claim that says, that makes it true, that everyone dies alone. Such a person presumably is not feeling lonely or alienated while he dies. He used to bring people in to sit around his deathbed talking about various matters with him. As a fan of the body view, I believe I’ll still exist for a while. And the first question we’re going to be focusing on is just this, the question of the badness of death. And eventually, we’ll turn to some other value questions about if death really is the end, should we be afraid of death? But the first one is simply, is death bad, as we typically take it to be, and, if so, what is it about it that makes it bad?So again, I’m going to suppose here on out that the metaphysical view that I’ve been sketching is right; that physicalism is true. We’re no longer able to tell our troubles with them and get their advice. According to Klopstock, the crucial badness of death is losing your friends."
735,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-17,"This lecture continues to explore the issue of why death may be bad. According to the deprivation account, what is bad about death is the fact that because one ceases to exist, one becomes deprived of the good things in life. Being dead is not intrinsically bad; it is comparatively bad and one is worse off only by virtue of not being able to enjoy the things one enjoyed while alive, such as watching the sunset, listening to music, and discussing philosophy.","Last time we made the turn from metaphysics to value theory. Nonetheless, it seems likely that if we want to get clear about the central badness of death, it can’t be a matter of the loss for those who remain behind, but rather the loss, the badness of death, for the person who dies. You say, how  nonexistence be bad for me? How could anything be bad for you when you don’t exist? And in particular, then, how could nonexistence be bad for you when you don’t exist?So it’s not, as I say, altogether straightforward to see how the answer “Death is bad for me, because when I’m dead I don’t exist,” how that  the problem, as opposed to simply focusing our attention on the problem. It’s something we want to avoid for its own sake. Well, of course, ten bucks is intrinsically good. What’s most importantly bad about the fact that I’ll be dead is the fact that when I’m dead, I won’t be getting the good things in life. So death, the most terrifying of ills, is nothing to us, since so long as we exist, death is not with us; but when death comes, then we do not exist. It does not then concern either the living or the dead, since for the former it is not, and the latter are no more. ”You see, it’s not altogether clear what Epicurus is bothered by there, but one possible interpretation is this puzzle about the timing of the badness of death. But for all that, it’s true that I killed him. If there are facts that you can’t date, maybe here’s another one. So perhaps we should just say, “Well, you were right, Epicurus,” if this was Epicurus’ argument. “ My death is bad for me during the time I’m dead. Perhaps we should say, look, for certain kinds of bads you don’t need to even  in order for those things to be bad for you. And I need a female volunteer from the audience. Now, how many of us feel sorry for Larry? Now, it’s important in thinking about this, that we not slip back into some version of the soul view, especially some version of the soul view where the souls are prior existents. But that’s not what the story is at all on the physicalist picture that I’m assuming. But at least it’ll give you a sense of just how many potential people there are. Actually, I discovered some time after having done this calculation that the number of possible eggs is far greater. Now, I don’t know about you, when  think about it, all I can say is it doesn’t strike me as being a moral catastrophe. I can keep the claim that death is bad for me by giving up the existence requirement. But if I give up the existence requirement, I’ve got to say it’s a tragedy that Larry and the untold billions, billions, billions, billions — it’s a tragedy that they’re deprived of life as well. For something to be bad for you, you have to exist at the very same time as the bad thing. So the modest one allows us to say that death is bad for me."
736,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-18,"The discussion of the badness of death continues by asking whether it is bad that we do not exist before our birth. The views of a number of contemporary philosophers, such as Tom Nagle, Fred Feldman, and Derek Parfit, are introduced. Then Professor Kagan turns to the subject of immortality. Would it be desirable to live forever, and if so, under what circumstances one might enjoy such a prolonged existence? The lecture concludes with Bernard Williams’ take on immortality which posits that no kind of human life can continue to be enjoyable and attractive for eternity.","Last time I sketched the deprivation account. If we say that, then indeed, we can say, “It’s not bad that Larry doesn’t exist, because he doesn’t  now.” If we accept the modest existence requirement, then we can say, it’s not bad that Larry doesn’t exist, because, well, Larry doesn’t get into the club. So the modest existence requirement allows us to avoid both extremes. Well, we can say, look, that’s worse for them — to live merely 50 years instead of the full 90 or 100 years. Now, imagine that instead of living 50 years, the person lives only 10, 20 years and then dies. Imagine that I caused them to die after one year. So although we were making things worse and worse and worse and worse and worse as we shortened the life, when we finally snip out that last little fraction of a second, it turns out we didn’t make things worse at all. Maybe the most we could hope for is, which is the least  thing to say here? Imagine this is the period before my birth. Because if only we had existed then, we’d be able to enjoy the good things in life. And so, the conclusion comes, and now we see why it’s okay to care more about that one than this one, the one after death and the one before birth. To use the vocabulary that we introduced in thinking about some of Plato’s arguments, we might say although — suppose I die at age 80 — that’s a fact about me, it’s a  fact about me. But the date of my  is not a contingent fact about me. After all, very same sperm, very same egg, makes for the very same person. Because when you imagine  being different, you imagine a  life. But we can see that this is not an arbitrary preference on our part, because in fact, it’s part of a quite general pattern we have of caring about the future in a way that we don’t care about the past. At some point in your life history, that operation is going to have occurred. The past is fixed, the future is open, the direction of time. But for all that, it seems to me the right way to go. Death is bad for you because you don’t have what life would bring you, if only you hadn’t died. Life would have given you a lot of great things and you get deprived of those great things, that’s why it’s bad that you got hit by the truck. But if it should turn out that what life would have had hereafter, instead of being good, would have been hellish, it’s not bad for you to avoid that. And then they give me some more and some more. Would it, in fact, be better and better and better? Here’s one way to try to imagine that story. Well, all of that seems right, but I suppose we’d be forgiven for thinking, look, when we wanted to be immortal, we didn’t want  kind of life going on and on and on with the same trajectory, the same downward trajectory. We sort of wanted to live forever, hail and hearty and healthy. Is there any way to imagine existing forever where that would be good for you, ? Now, it’s very tempting at this point to say, look, of course. Remember, eternity is a very, very long time."
737,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-19,"The lecture begins with further exploration of the question of whether it is desirable to live forever under the right circumstances, and then turns to consideration of some alternative theories of the nature of well-being. What makes a life worth living? One popular theory is hedonism, but the thought experiment of being on an “experience machine” suggests that this view may be inadequate.","We’ve been talking about the question as to whether or not it would be desirable to live forever, whether immortality would actually be a good thing, as most of normally presume, or whether in fact, as Bernard Williams argues, it would be undesirable. And the prospect of having a lot of time to pursue math problems of a richer and deeper sort seems fairly attractive. Right now, with our 50, 80, 100 years, we don’t fill our day doing only one kind of activity. And 50 or 100 years traveling around the world. But again, the crucial point to remember is that forever is literally forever. Now, what happens to rats when you do this? And no doubt you would enjoy it for a very long time. We can reflect on our first order or base level experiences. Of course, we could perhaps deal with that problem by making us more rat-like in terms of our thinking processes. the question I’m asking is a question to you, here, now. That’s far better than the rat’s existence. What I found when I thought about the Methuselah case was, even though it was me at age 800, the same person as the one who’s standing here in front of you now, it didn’t really matter. So, I agree with Bernard Williams when he says immortality wouldn’t be desirable. But rather, the best thing I suppose would be to be able to live as long as you wanted. It could still be the case that we die .According to the deprivaton account, death is bad, when it’s bad, because of the fact that it deprives us of the good things in life, insofar as we would have continued to get good things in life. That is, more strictly,  because of what they lead to. Well, money’s worth having because, among other things, you can buy ice cream with it. The other things were valuable as a means, ultimately to pleasure. But notice that if we’ve got hedonism or, for that matter as we’ll see, some other theories of wellbeing, if we’ve got hedonism, we’re able to make the kinds of evaluations that I was helping myself to when I started talking a few minutes ago about well, you know, if what life would hold for you is bad overall, then you’re better off dying and so forth. See whether the grand total of pleasures is greater than the grand totals of pain. And we do our best, however good or bad that may be. Now, it will not come as news to me if I were to learn that several of you, maybe even many of you, in this class accept hedonism. So, that really won’t do the trick in giving us the best quality pleasures of the kinds that humans most crave — the pleasures of friendship and discussion and sexual intimacy. Strictly speaking, that’s not true, because you’re not up on Mount Everest. But you don’t know that you are floating in the tank. When you’re on the experience machine, you’ve got — your brain is being stimulated in such a way that you’ve got the identical experience on the inside to what it would feel like if you really  doing these things. Says something about how old this example is that we talk about plugging in the tapes. Although it would make me very, very sad to discover this, I suppose it’s possible some of you have such bad lives that moving on to the experience machine would be a step up. There couldn’t possibly be anything more."
738,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-1,Professor Kagan introduces the course and the material that will be covered during the semester. He aims to clarify what the class will focus on in particular and which subjects it will steer away from. The emphasis will be placed on philosophical questions that arise when one contemplates the nature of death. The first half of the course will address metaphysical questions while the second half will focus on value theory.,"The very first thing I want to do is to invite you to call me Shelly. In particular, do we have souls, and for this class when I talk about a soul, what I’m going to mean is sort of a bit of philosophical jargon. Or, more generally, we’ll worry about how should the fact that I’m going to die affect the way I live? There’s a line that I’m going to be developing, pushing, if you will, or defending in this class. Now, since of course, I believe the views I believe — and I hope at the end of the semester you’ll agree with me, because I think they’re true and I hope you’ll end up believing the truth . Karen, maybe this would be a good time for you to pass around the syllabus. One kind of evidence or one kind of argument that we won’t be making use of here is appeal to religious authority. In fact, you won’t be able to finalize your registration for your courses until you’ve actually signed up for an available slot. I don’t want you to just start talking, but raise your hand. At any rate, I don’t know for certainty that I’m a harder grader, but I believe that it’s the case based on reactions I get when I give the speech that I’m about to give. A means excellent work for a first class in philosophy. You did it in a way that made us take note. Many of you will end up getting Bs, if not at the beginning, by the end of the semester. Many of you will start out doing satisfactory work or, truth be told, less than satisfactory work. You sit down the night before and you had a couple of ideas. Because writing a philosophy paper is a difficult thing to learn how to do. For many of you, the first paper will be clearly the worst paper you write. Unsurprisingly, you’ve got the ability to do decent work in this class and most of you have the ability to do good work, and some of you have, a fair chunk of you have, the ability to do excellent work, though it may take some work on your part to get to that point. Any question about any of that?All right. One other remark about the discussion sections. The crucial point about intro is it means first class in philosophy. We’ll be reading one of Plato’s dialogues. You won’t get everything I’m talking about in the lectures, if all you do is the readings. I want to end by — I’m not close to ending, but the last thing I’m going to do is read aloud some student evaluations. I don’t know how to make this point any clearer than to share with you a sampling of the student evaluations. These are actual quotes from former actual students.(1) “The lectures were clear and followed a very logical order.” ( 11) “Though I’ve heard students say he often repeats himself, I think this is a merit in a philosophy course in which arguments and thoughts can quickly become confusing.” ( It made me think about life and death in a new way."
739,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-20,"Lecture 20 continues the discussion of the value of life. It considers the neutral container theory, which holds that the value of life is simply a function of its contents, both pleasant and painful, and contrasts this with the valuable container theory, which assigns value to being alive itself. The lecture then turns to a consideration of some of the other aspects of death that may contribute to the badness of death. Among the issues addressed are the inevitability, variability and unpredictability of death.","Last time, I invited you to think about life on the experience machine, where the scientists are busy stimulating your brain in such a way as to give you an exact replica, from the insides of what it would be like having identical experiences to the ones you would have if you were really doing — well, whatever it is that’s worth doing. Would you be happy or would you be unhappy, to discover that you actually have been living a life on the experience machine? The one thing we can conclude immediately is, if you think life on the experience machine is missing something, that the hedonist — and views like hedonism — must be wrong, insofar as they say that all that matters for the best possible life is — for well-being — is getting the right kinds of experiences, getting the right kinds of mental states. You’re not actually getting the things out of life you thought you were getting. If somebody sets themselves — or so it seems to me at least — if somebody sets theirself the goal of making the biggest rubber band ball in the Eastern United States, I suppose there’s a sense of the word that that’s an accomplishment if they’ve got it, but it doesn’t strike me as the kind of accomplishment which makes for a particularly valuable life. After all, not every bit of knowledge is equally valuable. And deciding how valuable it is, how good it is for me to be alive is a matter of adding up the value of the contents of the life. We’ve expanded the list of goods that can go  your life, but for all that, we’ve still been acting as though the neutral container theory is the right approach. The life of somebody who can have an emotional side. You can imagine somebody who has that view. And so even if, you might say, the way my life is going in terms of its contents is bad, being alive per se might still be a good thing. Notice that on the modest view, if we ask ourselves, would it have been good to be immortal? Because, of course, if you’re a modest, if you accept the modest version of the valuable container theory, then if the contents get bad , that can outweigh the positive value of life. I don’t find the fantastic container theory myself — I don’t find it particularly attractive. It could still be the case that we die before life has turned bad. So that death — they’re optimists in this strange sense, if they think life would’ve been good, which means of course that  we die is bad for us. Because if we were supposed to live forever, then we would live forever. We have to not talk — just talk about the good things in the life, but the good of life itself, and we have to notice that perhaps on certain views, for certain cases, it’s not really the case that when I die I’m being deprived of a good life. And as I say, I myself, in different moods, get pulled in both ways. Some people live 80 years, some people live 20 years. Because of the birthmark, everybody knows exactly how much longer they’ve got. And because you can’t really know, it’s difficult to make the right kinds of plans. And in particular, it’s hard to know how to pace yourself. You continue to stick around, and then your life has this feeling of — at least we can imagine this happening — being sort of anticlimactic. Now, in thinking about these points, in effect I’m suggesting that the value of your life — so ,we previously were talking about different theories of well-being and what makes for the best kind of life. We might think of it as, the overall shape of your life matters. When the bad is behind us, that seems less bothersome than when the bad is in front of us. All of this suggests then that the unpredictability of our death adds an extra negative element."
740,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-21,"Further bad aspects of death are considered, including ubiquity, or the fact that death may occur at any time and strike anyone. Professor Kagan invites students to contemplate the possibility of death-free time periods, vacation spots, and activities. Then there is consideration of the value of the human condition, which consists of life, followed by death. Finally, the question is raised as to whether it could be appropriate to refuse to face the facts about our mortality. Professor Kagan distinguishes between two ways in which thinking about these could influence human behavior. On the one hand, it may give one the reason to behave differently; on the other hand, it may just cause a change in behavior.","Last time we started asking ourselves about what are some of the other aspects of death that might contribute to its badness, or at least other features of death that are worth thinking about. And it’s worth — ;it’s sort of a useful test for asking yourself what are the things you must value in life — to ask, what would you choose to do if you knew you had five years, ten years, what have you?There’s an old  routine where one of the actors is in the doctor’s office, and the doctor gives him the very sad news that he’s got two minutes left to live. At least, he was taking it until Spring Break. And again, to move back and ask ourselves a larger question, would knowing how much time you have be something that would allow you to actually embrace those choices, or would it instead just be a burden? So you couldn’t die unless you were engaged in certain activities. And yet, it seems to me that there are many activities, and if not many at least several activities, that people do precisely for that reason. And the fact that we’re always facing some risk of death recedes into the background in the way that most of us don’t hear background noise — that what jumping out of an airplane does for you is it spikes the risk of death. ”So let’s ask ourselves, are there any interaction effects when we talk about the human condition that it’s life followed by death?” Yeah, there are actually some ways in which the combination ends up becoming worse. Let me start briefly by mentioning a possibility for a positive interaction effect. After all, not having the meal is just an absence of a certain experience. And we might think, look, this is one of the negative things about the human condition that we get a taste of life — nothing more — before it’s snatched away. We turn into pieces of rotting flesh, decaying. One possible positive effect, the extra preciousness of life. Better to have not had any of it, better to have not been born at all, say the pessimists, than to have this combination package of life followed by death. But in fact, as a matter of logic, that doesn’t follow at all. So, even if we were to agree with the pessimists that it would be better never to have been born at all, as the old joke goes, show me one person in a thousand who’s so lucky, right? Another possibility, the one I’ll turn to a little bit later, is admit the facts and live accordingly. Not thinking about those facts that I knew at one point — just not all that objectionable. If I thought about that fact, it would just be overwhelming. That was certainly the point that Tolstoy was trying to get us to see. I’m not going to tell you what these facts are yet. And so you know that if only you were to read these things in the envelope, you would change your mind and no longer want to go out with her. So there are certain facts about the digestive tract such that if you think about them you can’t do something, kiss the person. So the facts could be things that would give you  to change your behavior. And, given that, we might say, better to not think about them. Suppose, for example, that, the right way to live, in light of the facts about death, is to live life to the fullest."
741,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-22,"Professor Kagan explores the issue of how thinking about death may influence the way we live. Fear as an emotional response to death is discussed as well as whether it is appropriate and under what conditions. A distinction is made between fear of the process of dying, and fear of death itself and what may come when one is dead. Finally, a number of other negative emotions are considered as possible appropriate responses to death and dying, such as anger, sadness, and sorrow.","Last time, I distinguished between two ways in which thinking about the facts about the nature of death could influence our behavior. I rather have in mind our emotional response, because indeed one of the most common reactions to death, I suppose, is  of death. It’s a harder question whether all these things need to be in place in order to feel the emotion. It’s certainly logically possible, but it’s so unlikely, it’s so negligibly small a chance, that if anybody here is afraid that they’ll be ripped to pieces by tigers, then I can only say the fear doesn’t make any sense, it’s not appropriate. Suppose you tell me that, oh, when you’re not a student, your work study program, what you do is, you work as an animal trainer, or you’re planning to work in the circus where you’ll be training tigers, then I’ll say, all right, now I suppose there’s a nonnegligible chance you’ll be mauled and killed by tigers. All right, so you need to have a chance of the bad thing, and it’s got to be a large enough chance. Again, being a little sloppy, maybe you afraid, but if so, fear doesn’t make sense, when you know for a certainty that the bad thing is coming and how bad it is. Bad thing, nonnegligible chance, and lack of certainty. Let me show you what it feels like, it feels like that; over and over, 5, 6, 7, 8 times; we’re doing some sort of weird psychology experiment here. Similarly, the amount of fear needs to be proportioned to the  of the bad. The first thing you might worry about is the process of dying. The badness of death after all, according to the deprivation account, is the mere absence of a good. You wish you could have a second ice cream cone. See, fear there doesn’t make sense, because it doesn’t have the relevant degree of uncertainty. If so, we might say the crucial ingredient here, by virtue of which death is something that it’s appropriate for us to be afraid of is because of the unpredictability. It seems to me that if it weren’t for the unpredictability, fear of death wouldn’t make any sense at all. I want to shake my fist at the universe and curse the universe for giving me only 50 years or 70 years or 80 years even 100 years, when the world is such a rich, incredibly fantastic place that it would take thousands of years or longer to exhaust what it has to offer. Of course, again, we no doubt feel anger in other cases, although typically when we’re angry at inanimate objects it’s because we’ve personified them. At least, once your anger has subsided, you can step back and say, look, getting angry at your computer doesn’t really make sense, because your computer is not a person; your computer is not an agent; your computer didn’t have any choice or control. Suppose that — take those two conditions and now ask ourselves, does it make sense then to be angry at the fact that we’re going to die? Condition number two, after all, requires that God has mistreated us in giving us our 50 or 80 or 100 years. It’s just atoms swirling, forming various kinds of combinations. And I think some emotion along that line does make sense."
742,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-23,"In this lecture, Professor Kagan invites students to pose the question of how one should live life knowing that it will certainly end in death. He also explores the issue of how we should set our goals and how we should go about achieving them, bearing in mind the time constraints. Other questions raised are how this ultimately affects the quality of our work and our accomplishments, as well as how we decide what is worth doing in life.",
743,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-24,"This is the first of a series of lectures on suicide. Two very distinct contexts are presented in which the subject can be further explored. The first is rationality and the question of under what circumstances it makes sense to end one’s own life. The second is morality and the question of whether we can ever ethically justify resorting to suicide. The lecture’s focus is on the rational requirements of suicide, and Professor Kagan introduces a number of cases which demonstrate that ending one’s life, in certain instances, may be rationally sound.","Last time, we talked about how you should live your life, in light of the fact of our — your mortality. And if you’re not crazy, then it shows that you’re immoral. Questions of rationality on the one hand, and questions of morality on the other. But at least most people are inclined to think that we are drawing on different evaluative standards when we raise the one set of questions, as opposed to when we raise the other. But for all that, it would be  of me, perhaps, to go to the worse school. Could it ever be rational for you to kill yourself? And the very fact that you can’t think clearly would entail that you shouldn’t trust your judgment that you are in one of those cases. And you think, well, here’s how well off I am now, being overweight. And, as I say, there are a number of philosophers who are drawn to it. For most of us, dying would be bad, because it would deprive us of the good things in life that we would get, if only we didn’t die. If we believe in the two-state requirement, we’ve got to say, Oh, so had I died, I would have been in some state that I could compare to my current state and say that it’s worse. Not that you’d be in some condition that’s a good one. And the greater the number, the greater the positive number, the more your life is worth living. That’s a life that’s bad for you to have and you’d be better off not having it. But still, the same basic idea is going to be in place. But opposed to the neutral container theories, we had valuable container theories which say the very fact that you’re alive adds some positive value above and beyond whatever’s going on in your life. Now, even the valuable container theories came in different versions. Most fans of the claim that being alive, per se, is valuable don’t really mean life . They mean something more like life as a person. So, the basic idea behind valuable container theories is that life, or the life of a person, or something like that, has intrinsic value above and beyond the question of what’s going on within your life. Either we believe in the neutral container theory and think it’s a contingent matter whether the contents are sufficiently good or bad. There are medical conditions where, horribly enough, infants get born where they’re just in continual pain and they never develop cognitively. So it’s contents plus the extra bit you get from being alive. And then after a while, your existence is going to be worse than nothing. Suppose that what you’ve got is a degenerative disease that is going to progressively strip you of the ability to control your body. Because your choice is not end it here or end it there. This point, I think, is probably crucial enough that it’s worth taking a moment to reflect on."
744,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-25,"The discussion of suicide continues. A few more cases are introduced to consider circumstances under which it might be rational to end one’s life, and more graphs are drawn that show relevant variations in the quality of one’s life. A question is then posed about how one should make a decision about continuing or ending life, given that one cannot know the future with certainty. Finally, two quick moral arguments concerning suicide which rest on theological premises are presented.","Last time, we were discussing the rationality of suicide. Here, the crucial point to make, of course, is that even though for a while your life will be worse than nothing, negative overall, it doesn’t mean that it makes sense to kill yourself at this point. Since the choices have neither of these, or both, and the positive third act is great enough to outweigh the negative second act, on balance, it doesn’t make sense. And although that’s true the way I’ve drawn the graph, we could imagine that it wasn’t quite like that. The interesting point is that these possibilities are not mere theoretical possibilities, but actually can happen. He asked that he be killed and people refused. And of course, since it is worth living, now that I’m able to kill myself, it no longer makes sense for me to kill myself. Still, it does seem to me that there are cases in which the line does cut below the x axis and remains there for a sufficiently long time, perhaps remains there forever, so that the person is better off dead. And if so, could it ever then be reasonable to act on that judgment and end your life? Here we’re still looking at things from the personal, rational perspective. Let’s come back to that worry in a moment. It’s true that we don’t have a crystal ball, and so in deciding whether to kill yourself, what you’re doing is playing the odds. Indeed, there is no getting away from the fact that in the suicide case, in the case of some terminally ill patient, or at least somebody who appears to be terminally ill, there is no getting away from the fact that regardless of what decision he or she makes, they are gambling. But if you want to insist that the  rational decision must be to hold out for the chance of a wonderful vacation, no matter how small the odds — given that if you don’t get that wonderful vacation, you’re going to be tortured and you could avoid all that by picking the sleep option — if somebody insisted in the face of all that, that the only rational decision is to go through the door which is likely to be torture and a vanishingly small chance of vacation, I’d say they’re just wrong. The point was, perhaps I’m cheating in making the example this way, because death of course, isn’t — of course, what you’re all supposed to be lulled into thinking is that death, choosing death, choosing suicide, is sort of like choosing to be asleep, a state of dreamless sleep, but sleep nonetheless. Well, each of us has to decide for themselves. Sometimes it happens, but no more than 1 in 100 or 1 in 1,000. You’ve got some horrible, painful disease and it won’t get better unless you have the surgery. Of course, like all surgery, there are risks. You should discuss it with your loved ones. The rationality of suicide, I think, is secured. Maybe this isn’t so much a moral argument as a theological argument. But the topic’s almost unavoidable when we think about suicide, given the prevalence of the thought, it’s God’s will that we stay alive and so it’s going against God’s will to kill ourselves. And maybe the doctor should say something similar. You might think, for example, that the Bible tells us not to commit suicide. The instruction manual says not to eat pork."
745,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-26,"The lecture begins by examining the consequences a suicide has on both the person committing it and those around this person. The question is raised, however, whether this factor is the only that counts morally, as utilitarians claim, or whether other factors matter morally as well, as deontologists claim. The moral relevance of a deontological prohibition against harming the innocent is considered. A concluding summary of the course is offered.","Last time we turned to questions about the morality of suicide, and I started with two arguments that I called quick and dirty arguments. I suggested that, at least if we look at them in their quick and dirty versions, they were inadequate, and if we’re going to make a more careful argument about the morality of suicide, we need to turn to a more systematic view about the contents of morality. But there’s at least one factor or one feature that all, or almost all, moral theories agree about. There are moral views that take this position. And that’s also pretty obviously an implausible thing to claim. We can even think of cases where your life is worse than nothing, you’d be better off dead, and there is no medical alternative of a cure available to you, but for all that, it  isn’t morally legitimate to kill yourself in terms of the utilitarian outlook. Look, there’s no debate between deontologists and utilitarians about harming innocent people in the normal case, because normally of course — you know, suppose I, to make an example — to end the class with a nice big bang, right — I brought my Uzi sub-machine gun. So, here is one of my favorite examples in moral philosophy. For our purposes, let’s just suppose that most of us are on board with the deontologists when they say there’s more to morality than what the utilitarian has, and this example brings it out. People have a right to life, a right not to be killed. And now, it seems what we have to say is, suicide is wrong. Because when I kill myself, well, I’m killing somebody. And if we were to accept that claim, then we could say the right to life only covers how I treat others. Well, that clearly doesn’t make it acceptable to kill him or her — well, nephew, it’s a him. Maybe we should say, no, consent really doesn’t have the kind of power that a minute ago it looked like it did. Really, it’s do nothing, let them get killed but I probably won’t be hurt very much, or throw myself on the hand grenade, my body absorbs the blow, saves my buddies, kills me. Imagine what happens is that I throw myself on the hand grenade. Yeah, of course, five buddies saved; the results are better. But that doesn’t seem enough to use in our deontological moods. We might insist that, look, the permission has got to be given freely. So, suicide will again be acceptable in some cases, though not in all. And there I think there is good reason to ask yourself, are you confident that the person has satisfied the conditions on the consent principle? It seems to be an unpleasant topic, and we put it out of our mind. As I argued when talking about immortality, better still would be if only we had the prospect of living as long as life still had something left to offer us. But having said that, it doesn’t follow that immortality would be a good thing."
746,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-2,"Professor Kagan discusses the two main positions with regard to the question, “What is a person?” On the one hand, there is the dualist view, according to which a person is a body and a soul. On the other hand, the physicalist view argues that a person is just a body. The body, however, has a certain set of abilities and is capable of a large range of activities.","The first question we want to discuss has to do with the possibility of my surviving my death. You think, the first thing we have to get clear on is well what am I? What’s the metaphysical composition of people, on the one hand? Now as I say, I believe that when push comes to shove, we do need to get clear about both of those questions and so that’s going to take the first several weeks of the class. There couldn’t possibly be life after death. Now, no doubt, you can kill people in a lot of different ways. This is exactly where I don’t really know the details, but I take it it’s something like: because of whatever the original input was, eventually the blood’s no longer circulating and oxygen isn’t making its way around the body. So on the monist view — which we’ll call “physicalism,” because it says that what people just are, are these physical objects — on the physicalist view, a person is just a body that can…now you fill in the blank. You point out the kinds of things that we can do. Just like each of you is viewing the world from a particular location. Crucial point, of course, the attraction of the dualist view, from our point of view, is that if there’s a soul as well as the body, and the soul is something immaterial, then when the body dies, when we have B through B and the death of the body occurs. But if the soul is something immaterial, then that could continue to exist, even after the destruction of the body. A couple of things to point out about this view. So a person has two basic building blocks. So if we want belief in a soul to help us leave open the door to the possibility that I survive the destruction of my body, it had better not be that the body is an essential part of me. Just like when you prick my body, that bodily process sets up certain things taking place in my soul. S. The question is: How do I draw the soul? The reason I think it doesn’t follow trivially is because, remember, I said we’re dealing with interactionist dualism. And because of that my soul is having various visual sensations about the number of people in front of me, colors, and so forth and so on. Once we’ve admitted that on this kind of dualist picture the material body can influence what happens in the immaterial soul, then it doesn’t seem that we have any grounds for shutting the door to the possibility that the right physical process, B through B, might set up this horrible mental, soul process, S through S, resulting in the destruction of the soul. If you want to say souls have a location, where are they located? Sometimes people talk about, in fact we’ll be reading about this, out-of-body experiences. So maybe that’s how it works with the soul. Some physical objects can do things of a far more interesting sort than other physical objects. But on the physicalist view, a person is just a body."
747,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-3,"The lecture focuses on arguments that might be offered as proof for the existence of the soul. The first series of arguments discussed is those known as “inferences to the best explanation.” That is, we posit the existence of things we cannot see so as to explain something else that is generally agreed to take place.","Today we’re going to take up the discussion where we left it last time. Now, the crucial point here, the point I was turning to as we ended last time, is that although a person on the physicalist view is just a body, a person isn’t just any old body. This is similar, let’s say, to talking about a smile. Physicalists don’t deny that there are minds. It seems to be in the vicinity of the mouth. Similarly, then, according to the physicalist, talk of the mind, despite the fact that we have a noun there, is just a way of talking about the abilities of the body to do various things. Talk of all of those things is what we mean by the mind, but there’s no extra thing, the mind, above and beyond the body. Well, it no longer can function properly. But minds are just a way of talking about the abilities of the body. So there’s an agreement that there are bodies. Each one of you is sort of dragging one around with you. we might start by asking, what reasons do we have to believe in anything? Because doing that allows me to explain why people get sick. Are there things about us that the physicalist cannot explain? Depending on what  you fill in the blank with, what pet feature or fact you’re trying to explain by appeal to the soul, you get a different argument. Maybe there are certain supernatural things about communication from the dead or near-death experiences that need to be explained in terms of the soul. We need something to be pulling the strings, to be directing the body. As the plane tries to dodge it, the missile corrects its course. Maybe people are just robots commanded from outside by God. We’re not just robots with some sort of program in our brain that we’re following. What about the fact that — We said there’s a family of arguments, all of which have the general structure, inference to the best explanation, you need souls in order to explain feature . Of course, once you start thinking of it this way, it’s natural to talk this way across a variety of things that the computer may be trying to do. That will follow once we assume that no physical object has beliefs or desires. But there’s an aspect of desires, the emotional side, that machines can’t have, but we clearly do have."
748,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-4,"After a brief introduction to Plato’s , more arguments are offered in this lecture in defense of the existence of an immaterial soul. The emphasis here is on the fact that we need to believe in the existence of a soul in order to explain the claim that we possess free will. This is an argument dualists use as an objection to the physicalists: since no merely physical entity could have free will, there must be more to us than just being a physical object.","We’ve been talking about the question, “What arguments might be offered for the existence of a soul?” Plato is not only one of the greatest philosophers in history, he wrote his philosophy in the form of dialogues. So, still, what you should do is start reading it for next week. People can’t just be machines, because machines can’t reason. And then armed with all of that, you sort of do your best. The odds are the computer’s going to make the best possible move. And now it’s in fact the case that the best programs can beat pretty much anybody. And although we don’t have machines that can reason about a lot of subjects yet, it seems pretty clear. When I was a kid there was a television show called . Hal tries to stop Dave, understandably enough. They’re just physical objects, programs on machines. If that’s right, if that’s the right thing to say, then what we have to say is, “We don’t need to appeal to souls in order to explain emotions and feelings. What it feels like to you when you’re worried or depressed or joyful or in love. And the thought, and I think this is a pretty powerful thought, is that even if the robots are behaving behaviorally, they’ve got the behavior side of the emotions down, they don’t have the feeling side at all. So we can build a machine that could sort red balls from blue balls. But for all that, we’ve got the notion, not only is he not seeing red, he can’t even imagine what it’s like to see red, never having had these experiences. Our experiences have qualitative properties. And then the question is, “What can the physicalist say in response?” When we think of the kinds of examples of material machines that we’ve got available to us in the fourteenth century, I try to imagine what would somebody in the fourteenth century think to himself or herself when he entertains the possibility that a plant might just be a machine? Life requires something immaterial above and beyond matter to explain it. ”But at this point, I think it’s crucial to remember the point that it’s not just the question, “Who’s got an explanation?” I think the soul theorist doesn’t have an explanation. We already know bodies can do some pretty amazing things. So we must be something more than a mere machine. And the robot or the computer or what have you is just automatically, mechanically following the code commands of the program. If you’re in this state, you will necessarily, given the laws of physics and the way the computer’s programmed and built and so forth, these wires will turn on, turn off, these circuits will turn on, turn off, boom, suddenly you’ll be in that state. Well, one and two gave us that we are not subject to determinism. Three says, all purely physical systems are subject to determinism."
749,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-5,"Professor Kagan discusses in detail the argument of free will as proof for the existence of an immaterial soul. The argument consists of three premises: 1) We have free will. 2) Nothing subject to determinism has free will. 3) All purely physical systems are subject to determinism. The conclusion drawn from this is that humans are not a purely physical system; but Professor Kagan explains why this argument is not truly compelling. In addition, near-death experiences and the Cartesian argument are discussed at length.","We’ve been talking about arguments that might give us reason to believe in the existence of an immaterial soul. You put these things together and you get the conclusion that we, since we’ve got free will, can’t be a purely physical object. There must be something more than the purely physical to us. You can’t have determinism and free will. And the answer is, “Well it’s not so clear that it is true.” Now, incompatibilism, I take it, is probably something like the common-sense view here. It’s the view that probably most of you believe, but again, it’s worth noting that philosophically it can be challenged. Hence, this view is known as compatibilism. Maybe we need to posit the soul in order to explain what goes on in séances or communications from the dead or what have you. They went to heaven but then were yanked back. Hence, inference to the best explanation. It’s as though we might think of there being two rooms, to use a kind of analogy here. Here the objection says, this two-room notion’s got to be mistaken. It can’t be that what’s going on in near-death experiences is that people are reporting about what it’s like to be dead because — so the objection says — they never really died. Or, if you want, you could say maybe they died, but since they obviously didn’t die permanently — after all they were brought back to life — how could they possibly tell us what it’s like to be permanently dead? Still, that doesn’t mean that we should believe the argument for the existence of the soul from near-death experiences, because the question remains, “What’s the best explanation of what’s going on in near-death experiences?” But this is, in fact, an area on which scientists work. Perhaps that explains the feelings of euphoria. How do we explain the fact that the person who’s conducting the séance knows things about, your history that only your dead uncle would know?” The dualist can explain that by appealing to ghosts and the like. One of them might work even though the other ones don’t work. I’m going to tell about myself, but you know, you’ll find the argument sort of, perhaps more persuasive if, as I tell the story, you imagine the story being told about you. If they’re really, bottom line, metaphysically speaking, the same thing, then you couldn’t have one without the other after all. But you can’t tell a story in which it exists and doesn’t exist. The argument is only making a much more specific claim. The point is just if I can at least imagine the one thing without the other, they must in fact be two separate things."
750,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-6,"The lecture begins with a continued discussion of the Cartesian argument and its weaknesses. The lecture then turns to Plato’s metaphysical views in the context of his work, . The key point in the discussion is the idea that in addition to the ordinary empirical world that we are familiar with, we posit the existence of a second realm in which the Platonic forms exist. These forms are the abstract properties that we attribute to physical objects, such as beauty, justice, goodness and so on. Since it is the soul that conceives of these Platonic forms and ideas, Plato argues that the soul not only outlives the body but lasts forever. It is perfect, immaterial and indestructible.","At the end of last class, we started sketching an argument that comes from Descartes, the Cartesian argument, that says merely by the process of thinking, on the basis of thought alone, it tends to show that the mind — We all agree that there are minds. It doesn’t seem especially difficult to do that. Suppose we try to imagine a world in which Shelly exists but Kagan doesn’t. That’s why I could imagine a world with one but not the other. From which it follows that my mind and my body must not be one thing. So when I refer to the Morning Star, I’m talking about Venus, whether or not I realize it’s Venus. Well, I can imagine the Evening Star without the Morning Star, so Son of Descartes, “Descarteson,” has to say, “Oh, so that shows that the Morning Star and the Evening Star are two different things.” At least, that’s how it seems to me, though as I say, there are philosophers that say, “No, no. What else could go wrong with the astronomy example? Imagination seems to be a guide to possibility; but maybe not always. Identity is not necessary, but contingent, as the philosophers put it. If you believe in a soul, what’s the argument for it?Well, what we’re about to turn to is Plato’s discussion of these issues in the dialogue the , which, as I told you last week, purports to lay out the final day’s discussion with Socrates before he is killed by — he kills himself — by drinking the hemlock in accordance with the punishment that’s been given to him. Well, in thinking about Socrates’ belief in the existence of a soul, it’s important to understand, it’s important to notice, that his take on which stuff gets assigned to the body, what are the bodily things versus what are the soul-like things, is rather different from the way, I think, most of us nowadays would draw the line. But one of the things that it can do, one of the things that sort of provides the underpinnings, as we’ll see, for Plato’s arguments for the immortality of the soul is the soul can think about — ;well, here I’ll have to introduce a word of philosophical jargon. Yet for all that, the mind can think about perfect justice. These things that we can think about that are the template, or at least the standard, or maybe at the very least it’s that which the ordinary humdrum things can participate in to varying degrees: perfect justice, justice itself, beauty itself, goodness itself, circularity itself, health itself. All of these things are, as philosophers nowadays call them, Platonic forms. But of course, this is not the number two here. It’s the soul that thinks about the Platonic forms."
751,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-7,"The discussion of Plato’s  continues, presenting more arguments for the existence and immortality of the soul. One such argument is “the argument from the nature of the forms,” which states that because the forms are non-physical objects and cannot be grasped by something physical like the body, it follows that they must be grasped by the soul which must be non-physical as well. This argument is followed by the “argument from recycling” and “the argument from recollection.”","We’ve begun to turn to Plato’s dialogue , and what I started doing last time was sketching the basic outlines of Plato’s metaphysics — not so much to give a full investigation of that — clearly we’re not going to do that here — but just to provide enough of the essential outlines of Plato’s metaphysical views so that we can understand the arguments that come up later in the , basically all of which or many of which presuppose something — certain central aspects about Plato’s metaphysical views. The sort of thing that perhaps we might call or think of as abstract objects or abstract properties. Rather, we think our mind can grasp the truths about numbers. Well, Plato thinks what’s going to follow is that we have some reason to believe in the immortality of the soul as, again, as we indicated last time, the picture is that the mind — the soul — is able to grasp these eternal Platonic forms, the ideas. Some of you who are maybe familiar with Plato’s later dialogue  may recognize at least what seems to me, what we have here, is a foreshadowing of the myth of the cave, or the allegory of the cave, which Plato describes there as well. Because in the center of the dialogue, before he dies, Socrates is arguing with his friends. And his disciples and friends are worried whether this is true or not. Notice how they differ from Aristotle’s views. But that’s not what the philosophers wanted us to do. So, we’ve got this nice Platonic picture where Plato says, “All right. The number three is not a physical object. Well, I’ve emphasized the non-physical aspect, and I’ve emphasized as well that they’re not changing. Now, people may come and go, but perfect justice — the idea of perfect justice — that’s timeless. I take it the claim basically is that, to put it in more familiar language, it takes one to know one. And the basic idea is that parts get re-used. Cars are made up of parts that existed before the car itself existed. Yet, for all that, it didn’t exist before my body began to exist. But we can only remember, he thinks, in the relevant way if our soul existed before the birth of our body, before the creation of our body. We see something that’s more or less round, and it reminds us of perfect circularity. I have to already be acquainted with her. If seeing things that participate in the forms remind me of the forms, it’s got to be because I’ve met or been acquainted directly with the forms before. But you don’t bump up against, you don’t meet, you don’t see or grasp or become directly acquainted with, the forms in this life. Although this is a form of an argument that Plato does put forward in other dialogues as well, and so it strikes me so there’s at least some reason to think this is an argument that he felt might well be right."
752,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-8,"The lecture focuses exclusively on one argument for the immortality of the soul from Plato’s , namely, “the argument from simplicity.” Plato suggests that in order for something to be destroyed, it must have parts, that is, it must be possible to “take it apart.” Arguing that the soul is simple, that it does not have parts, Plato believes that it would logically follow that the soul is indestructible.","We’ve been looking at Plato’s arguments for the immortality of the soul, and so far I have to say I haven’t found them very compelling arguments. So it might be, in order to think about justice and roundness, we have to grasp the forms. That would be just as likely a possibility as the alternative explanation that what’s going on is that ordinary empirical objects are reminding us of our prior acquaintance. Perhaps these ordinary objects act like letters of introduction, getting us to, helping us to, think about the forms for the very first time. Now, the engine is a prior-existing part. So the very next argument that Plato turns to can be viewed, I think, as responding to this unstated objection — well, I stated it, but Plato doesn’t state it in the dialogue — the worry that even if the soul was one of the parts, even if the soul was already around before we were born, how do we know it can’t come apart? How do we know the soul can’t be destroyed? My body is constantly changing because the relationships between my arms and my head and so forth, my muscles are moving. You rearrange the parts, the thing changes. So premise number one, only composite things can be destroyed. Premise number two, only changing things are composite. And now add three, invisible things don’t change. And one of the oddities is that, as far as I can see, Socrates never responds to that objection. And then if five is true, if the soul really is invisible, we’re entitled to conclude six, the soul can’t be destroyed — not, the soul can’t be destroyed, or if it can be destroyed it’s very, very hard and takes a very, very long time. Simmias says invisible things  be destroyed. So you’re wrong, Socrates, when you say invisible things can’t be destroyed. So he would need to argue then, perhaps, that harmony is not really invisible. And that’s why it will be worth taking some time to ask ourselves, well, what about Plato’s objections then? If some invisible things can be destroyed and harmony is an example of that, then, by golly, it’s going to follow that we can’t conclude from the invisibility of the soul that the soul cannot be destroyed. When he says, “Invisible things don’t change,” what he means is, things that you can’t see don’t change, and so — continue to interpret invisible in number four the same way — invisible things can’t be destroyed. But those that always remain the same, the forms, can only be grasped by the reasoning power of the mind. And what Socrates should have said is, harmony is not invisible in the relevant sense of invisible, since it can be sensed. Since the soul is invisible in that sense, it would follow that the soul can’t be destroyed. It turns it into these sounds that we can hear. But is it still invisible if by invisibility we mean can’t be detected?"
753,philosophy,phil-176,lecture-9,"Professor Kagan elaborates on the “argument from simplicity” and discusses in detail Plato’s claims that the soul is simple, changeless and therefore indestructible. The final Platonic argument under discussion is the “argument from essential properties” in which the essential properties of the soul are addressed. At the end of the lecture the question of whether one needs to argue for physicalism is posed.","We’ve been working our way through Plato’s arguments for the immortality of the soul. And last time I spent a fair bit of time working through objections to, not quite the last argument we’re going to look at, but the penultimate argument, in which Plato tries to argue for the simplicity of the soul. So we should have been skeptical in the first place of any argument that said, based on the invisibility of the soul, we can conclude that it’s changeless. Indeed, Plato himself, in other dialogues, argues against the simplicity of the soul. There’s a rational part that’s in charge of reasoning; there’s a spirited part that’s sort of like the will; there’s a part that has to do with appetite, desires for food, drink, sex, what have you. So perhaps it shouldn’t shock us that the argument he’s sketching here for the simplicity of the soul based on the changeless, invisible nature of the soul — perhaps it shouldn’t shock us that that argument doesn’t succeed after all. After all, where did the simples come from in the first place? Given moment there they were; the next moment, they no longer exist. A well-tuned, properly functioning body can produce mental activity. And so even if it turns out that there are some ways in which the mind isn’t exactly like harmony, it doesn’t show us that the physicalist view is wrong. First — this is, I think, an interesting argument — Plato says, harmony clearly cannot exist before the existence of the harp itself. And if mind were the sort of thing that was produced by the proper functioning of the physical body, then pretty obviously the mind could not exist prior to the creation of the physical body. But it doesn’t seem as though souls come in degrees. So that suggests it can’t really be like harmony and the harp after all. Just like you couldn’t have something that was fire without it being hot, you couldn’t have something that was a mind without it being capable of thought. And I think that’s what Plato means when he suggests the mind is essential — the soul is essentially alive. But Plato thinks we can rule out that other possibility. But there’s a second possible interpretation of deathless. But the mere fact that where there’s a soul it’s alive, doesn’t mean the soul couldn’t be destroyed. We grant Plato the thought that the soul has an essential property of being alive; from this, it follows that where there’s a soul it is alive, and hence, it’s deathless in sense A. But once we start thinking about the category, the notion of being deathless, we’re tempted to re-understand that as being deathless in sense B, can’t be destroyed. And I’ve argued that none of those arguments work either. I’m going to have us continue to think about death, but now think about death from the physicalist perspective. Given the assumption that the body is all there is, that talk about the mind is just a way of talking about the abilities of the body to do certain special mental activities. After all, I turned to the dualist and said, “Give me some reason to believe in souls.” I imagine nobody in this room believes in the existence of Zeus, the Greek god. Well, some of these are just drawings, and people were drawing things out of their imagination. But I’m not sure that I myself find such impossibility claims especially persuasive."
754,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-10,"Although we become virtuous by acting as the virtuous person does, a close reading of Aristotle’s text shows that, on his account, it is not enough to be virtuous that we act in certain ways. What’s needed, according to Aristotle, is that you knowingly act virtuously for its own sake from a stable character, and do so with pleasure. Professor Gendler turns to Julia Annas’s suggestion that Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi’s idea of  may be helpful in characterizing the condition that you take pleasure in the virtuous act. Finally, a critique of virtue ethics from John Doris and situationist psychology is raised which offers experimental evidence that casts doubt on the existence of stable character traits.Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s TED talk “Flow”","So today I’m going to give you your money’s worth in the sense that some of you might be taking this class to see whether you would want to take another philosophy class at some point in the future. So as I said, we’re going to be looking closely at something in the book that we’ve been reading from Aristotle, .In particular, we have heard many times recitation of Aristotle’s claim that virtues of character are acquired through habituation. In addition, the agent has to be in the right state when he does it. Second, you need to decide to do the action exactly because doing so is virtuous. But rather that your choice is expressive of, indicative of, arising from a state of character that you have that persists over time. I’m doing it because I’m interested in getting a medal. If he stands firm against terrifying situations and does not find it painful, he is brave. But if he finds it painful he is cowardly. In order for an action to count as virtuous on Aristotle’s picture, you have to do it knowing that it’s the virtuous act. Oh, that cowardly thing is so tempting, but I guess I’ll avoid it.” The brave person stands on the battlefield and–like the person who has turned a normative law into a descriptive one from last class–feels as if there’s nothing else to be done then the brave action. But money in itself is of only instrumental utility. If my skill level is low and the task is a little bit harder, I might feel  in the face of my inability to do it. So the Good Samaritan parable, as those of you raised in Christian religious traditions know, is a story that Jesus tells in the book of Luke when he is asked basically the question which we’ve asked Plato and Aristotle to answer for us: How is it that I can behave in the way that morality demands? ”So the story of the Good Samaritan is a story that, if you are thinking about it, should lead you presumably to recognize the virtue of helping the stranger in need. So the study that Darley and Batson did ran as follows. Now you might think if the hypothesis that what determines behavior is character were true, that those seminarians who had prepared a lecture on the Good Samaritan would be particularly likely to recognize the moral needs attaching to stumbling upon somebody who was injured. And those of them who were very often not only didn’t help the man, they stepped over his body and rushed over to the theater."
755,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-11,"Professor Gendler begins with a review of the situationist critique of virtue ethics,which claims that character plays only a minimal role in determining behavior. She then presents some countervailing evidence suggesting that certain personality traits appear to be quite stable over time, including work by Walter Mischel showing a strong correlation between an early capacity to delay gratification and subsequent academic and social success. Delayed gratification remains the topic of discussion as Professor Gendler shifts to Aristotle’s account of weakness of will and contemporary behavioral economics work on hyperbolic discounting. In the final segment of the lecture, drawing on work by Aristotle, Walter Mischel, George Ainslie and Robert Nozick, she presents several strategies for self-regulation: preventing yourself from acting on the temptation, manipulating incentive structures, and acting on principles.","So I left you at the end of last lecture with this incredible cliffhanger I put up on the slide, but… So let me get a running start and let you know where we were, finish up that lecture, and then move in to the topics for today. So we might ask first, what would a state look like that shares with virtue that one has knowledge of the right thing to do, that one decides to do it for that reason, and that one has the inclination, but that lacks the kind of character, or logical stability, that Aristotle takes to be a hallmark of true virtue?That, I think, is the state that Aristotle calls . Corresponding to temperance, on the other side of the scale, is what Aristotle calls  which is, in some sense, the mirror image of temperance. The intemperate person, with inclination, does the wrong thing and feels no conflict in the face of it. But somehow she contains herself and acts against her inclination. They want to do the thing that corresponds with morality. And I have here–I’m not kidding–I have here a class list. So for many decades the psychologist, George Ainslie, has studied decisions that have the following structure. You wake up in the morning, you say: “what I’m going to do is plan for my bicycling. So the second condition he tried was to take the kids who were in the circumstance where the rewards were hidden, and tell them to think really hard about the reward, think really hard about those marshmallows. What if we take the kids for whom the reward is visible and ask them to think happy thoughts about something else, right? And it made no difference in the hidden situation to think distracting thoughts. And what ties together the cases where we get large numbers?Mischel’s hypothesis, and this fits with the material that we discussed on January 20th, is that there are two systems of processing rewards. And when we think about things with a vivid, emotional attraction to them, that system gets activated and Plato’s horses, Aristotle’s non-rational parts, system one, aliefs and all the rest get going. By contrast, when kids are asked to think abstractly or to pretend that the marshmallow is imaginary, a cool, rational system–a system that is the one involved in belief that is Plato’s charioteer, that is the System Two of the dual processing tradition, that is the belief in the alief-belief tradition–comes on line. And what he comes up with are two different strategies. So that’s a way of externalizing responsibility for decision making in this case. The actions which you’re going to perform are actions on the world. You can subject yourself to interpersonal pressures. And it is in this light that Nozick discusses the roles that principles can play in allowing us not to be incontinent. The mark of a principle, he says, is that it ties the decision whether to do an immediate particular act to a whole class of actions of which the principle makes it part. And what comes at the end of the course, and I’ll preview it now, is a chance to think about the connections between them in the context of your final directed exercise."
756,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-12,"Professor Gendler begins with a general introduction to moral theories–what are they and what questions do they answer? Three different moral theories are briefly sketched: virtue theories, deontological theories, and consequentialist theories. Professor Gendler introduces at greater length a particular form of consequentialism—utilitarianism—put forward by John Stuart Mill. A dilemma is posed which appears to challenge Mill’s Greatest Happiness Principle: is it morally right for many to live happily at the cost of one person’s suffering? This dilemma is illustrated via a short story by Ursula Le Guin, and parallels are drawn between the story and various contemporary scenarios.","So what I want to do in today’s lecture is to shift gears somewhat from what we’ve been talking about in the first unit of the course. Or you might have some sort of combination theory. Is capital punishment morally permissible? It takes as its fundamental notion the notion of . So if we know what it is that produces happiness in sentient beings, then utilitarianism will give us an answer to the question of whether being vegetarian is morally mandated. The motivation with which an act is performed, says Mill, tells us nothing about the morality of the act. I want to save that person because it’s the right thing to do or some other sort of pro-social motive. Or is the act morally right regardless of its motive even if you do it because there’s a big sign up on the trees that say “save a drowning person: $10,000 reward.” In this case, by performing an act which has no different consequences for you as far as happiness is concerned, you double the happiness of a hundred other people with respect to the act. And I’m going the turn our timer on so that we have 10 seconds to see how it is that your first take on Mill’s Greatest Happiness Principle goes. So very few of you think that the moral act as the one whereby you get 100 units of happiness, and the 100 others get one unit. But I’ll be interested to see how all of this plays out. Let’s now contrast exactly the same first case. They’re incredibly happy in how they live. But that society exists as it does only because there is a child locked away whose suffering permits the society’s joy. Now, the question that I want you to think about in light of your answer a few minutes ago about what is demanded by morality is some things that seem to have the structure of the Omelas story. I take it that you noticed last week and the week before, when the snow was falling on Yale’s campus, and the routes were made clear for you to get to classes, that the possibility of you walking across campus depended upon a large number of people whose lives are already difficult getting up very early in the morning and doing back-breaking shoveling work in the ice cold. Indeed I take it that most of you are aware that the structure of the modern world bears a rather shocking similarity to the Omelas story. Now, almost all of you gave an answer that said this sort of structure is at least schematically morally acceptable. And the fundamental question, I think, of the Omelas story is whether this sentence, “They begin to realize that even if the child could be released, it would not get much good if its freedom, a little vague pleasure of warmth and food, no doubt, but little more,” is in fact true–or whether it is the sort of rationalization that recognition of one’s comfort brings with it. It has been afraid for too long ever to be free of fear. ”Now, I don’t have an answer to which of the two readings that I proposed is the right one to make of the Le Guin case."
757,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-13,"Professor Gendler opens with a final criticism of Utilitarianism from Bernard Williams: in some cases, a good person should feel reluctant to do an act which brings about the greatest happiness, even if it is the right thing to do. The second half of the lecture introduces Kant’s deontological moral theory. In contrast to consequentialism, deontology holds that it’s not the outcome of actions that matter for their moral valence, but rather the will of the agent performing such actions. The outlines of Kant’s deontological theory are presented, to be continued in the next lecture.","OK, so what I want to do today is to finish up the lecture that we were engaged with last week about utilitarianism and then to move on to what is perhaps the most dead-guy-on-Tuesday lecture of the semester, that is, an explanation of the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. In a minute, I’m going to present to you Williams’ analogy to the case of residual racism to try to help you see why someone who really has taken on board the consequentialist outlook thinks that the combination of views which most of you present, where you think the right thing to do is to kill the one to save the nineteen, but you also think the right thing to do is to feel bad about that in some way, have not fully appreciated what the utilitarian stance provides you with as a way of understanding morality. And he has theories of aesthetics, that is, what gives things aesthetic value. And in the case of ethics, he wrote something that he calls the , which is of course the work from which we read excerpts for today. And he says, taking a direct gibe at Aristotle, and noting as such that he’s so doing, neither can the ancient virtues–(Oh, my goodness, how do I close that email?)–neither can the ancient virtues of moderation and self control be considered as good in themselves. When I say that Kant is a critic of consequentialism I am not exaggerating. And again, I’ll spell out what each of those terms mean. OK, so three, incredibly complicated, subtle claims from Kant. So we can think about what Kant’s claim amounts to and how it differs from the other ones that we’ve been looking at by thinking of the question space in terms of a flow chart. OK.The second question that we ask, having eliminated now from the realm of morally worthy acts those that don’t accord with duty, is: What motive the act was done with? There’s no moral worth, says Kant, to acting kindly towards somebody when you feel sympathy towards them. Because in those cases, though your act is in keeping with what morality demands, it’s not done  it is the right thing to do. Cases where your inclination happens to line up with duty helpfully keep you out of this box of doing the wrong thing, but they don’t allow you to test your character and see of yourself that the motivation that you have for doing the right thing is to conform to what the moral law demands of you. But in order to determine whether an act is what morality demands of you, that act needs to be described in a particular way to you. The good will is the only thing that is good in itself,” says Kant, and it’s only by looking at the description under which an act is done that we can determine whether the good will was implicated in the right way in the choice to perform that action. We know that in order to be done from duty it needs to be done under a certain description. Not in so far that it articulates ways that you might have a well-ordered, harmonious, happy soul."
758,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-14,"The discussion of Kant from last lecture continues with a statement and explication of his first formulation of the categorical imperative: act only in such a way that you can will your maxim to be a universal law. Professor Gendler shows how Kant uses the categorical imperative to argue for particular moral duties, such as the obligation to keep promises. In the second part of the lecture, Philippa Foot’s Trolley Problem is introduced, which poses the problem of reconciling two powerful conflicting moral intuitions. A critique of Foot’s solution to the problem is explored, and the lecture ends with Judith Jarvis Thomson’s proposed alternative.“Moral Sense Test”","So there’s two things that we need to do in today’s lecture. Kant’s third claim is that duty, which is the central notion to deontology–, duty is at the core of deontology–duty is “the necessity of an action done out of respect for the law.” only thereby, says Kant, can one act autonomously and not heteronomously. And again we discover a breakdown of an ordered world in which we want to survive. When we transgress, says Kant, we don’t will that our maxim should become a universal law, but rather that the opposite of this maxim should remain a law universally. Do not use yourself as a means to an end, and do not use others in your interactions with them merely as means. Treat humanity and all others as ends in themselves. And finally, a rather complicated notion, sometimes called the kingdom of ends formulation, “act in accordance with the maxims of a member giving universal laws for a possible kingdom of ends”–a harmonious society in which everybody exists according to the laws that you give. The trolley driver is driving the trolley. Whereas in the transplant case, the choice that the doctor faces is between killing one and letting five die. And if we were to graph these on what I’ll call the bad-o-meter, which tells us how bad things are, we would discover that letting five die is bad, but killing one is worse, and killing five is even worse. So it looks like this bad-o-meter is pretty well capturing the intuition of those of you in this classroom. And whereas it seemed pretty clear to most of you in transplant that killing one was worse than letting five die, it seems pretty clear that for most of you in bystander, it’s the other way around. Maybe the problem in bystander is that since you’re not treating him as a means, it’s OK to kill the one. B, morally permitted, but not morally mandatory, or C, morally prohibited? That is, that when somebody has a right to bodily integrity, that takes precedence over the needs of the many. He could push the fat man off the bridge, and thereby cause the trolley to be stopped in its tracks by his weight. For the bystander in fat man, is it morally mandatory to push the fat man, morally permitted but not morally mandatory, or morally prohibited to push the fat man?And let’s take responses, and I’ll leave you with those numbers and a remark about them as our close. All of a sudden, 78% of you think it’s prohibited."
759,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-15,"The Trolley Problem, as discussed in the last lecture, is the problem of reconciling an apparent inconsistency in our moral intuitions: that while it is permissible to turn the runaway trolley to a track thus killing one to save five, it is impermissible to push a fat man onto the trolley track, killing him to save the five. In this lecture, Professor Gendler reviews several “non-classic” responses to this problem, each of which aims to bring the two cases, and hence our apparently conflicting judgments about them, together. The three responses considered differ not only in their conclusions, but also in their methodologies, illustrating how different techniques might be brought to bear on philosophical puzzles.","So we left ourselves at the end of the last lecture in a somewhat perplexing situation. Roughly 15% of you thought he was morally required to turn the trolley from the five to the one. So two of the responses that we’ll consider today are ones that suggest that Fat Man and Bystander in fact  carry different moral mandates. Is it morally permitted, but not morally required, for him to turn the trolley onto the track where it hits the other guy instead of himself? This is really, really, very, very horrible. OK, the whole lecture today depends upon these working. And more of you think it’s morally prohibited for him to let the trolley hit the five instead of himself. So let’s talk about the evidence that Greene has found in favor of the second premise–in favor of the premise that what goes on in cases like Fat Man is an emotional response, whereas what goes on in cases like classic Bystander is a rational response. The first kind of dilemma are dilemmas that he calls moral/personal dilemmas. These are dilemmas like Fat Man where you’re being asked whether you want to push the fat man off the bridge. The second class of cases that he has people consider in the scanner are what he calls moral and impersonal cases. But the fact that in the first case, the person they draw from the hat and it says person number four, and they think, “oh, I’ll give this amount of my proceeds to the person.” Here’s something else that appears to affect our moral responses to cases. Finally, some work by David Pizarro, a Yale PhD, suggests that in specific trolley cases, we can get people’s intuitions to move around in cases like Fat Man just by varying what most people would say are morally irrelevant features of the situation. In the first, you’re asked whether it is morally permitted, required, or prohibited, to push a man named Tyrone Peyton off the bridge in order to save 100 members of the New York Philharmonic. And the way that heuristics work is really smart. We’re interested in a target attribute–something that’s relatively hard to find out about the world. That’s how the heuristic attributes came to be the ones which you’re using as the markers of the target. And in particular, he thinks they do in a number of cases that he goes on to discuss. And I’m going to close today’s lecture with two examples that he gives. And Sunstein concludes on that basis that people make use of heuristics in moral reasoning just as they do in non-moral reasoning."
760,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-16,"In the first part of the lecture, Professor Gendler finishes up the discussion of non-standard responses to the Trolley Problem by presenting Cass Sunstein’s proposed resolution. This is followed by a general discussion of heuristics and biases in the context of risk regulation. In the remainder of the lecture, she introduces two additional puzzles: the puzzle of ducking vs. shielding (which is due to Christopher Boorse and Roy Sorensen) and the puzzle of moral luck. Whereas the ducking/shielding puzzle seems amenable to a heuristic-style solution, the puzzle of moral luck appears to be more profound. The fact that an action can seem more or less morally blameworthy depending on consequences which were entirely outside of the agent’s control seems to resist a solution in terms of heuristics, and instead leads to deeper problems of free will and moral responsibility.","So I want to start out by finishing up the discussion that we began last class about ways of thinking about the perplexity that the trolley case gives rise to. And we looked, last class, at Judy Thomson’s response, which says, look, there’s no asymmetry in the two cases, because when we reflect on the additional hypothetical case where there’s a third track on which you, yourself, are standing, we come to recognize that it’s not morally acceptable to turn in Bystander, just as it’s not morally acceptable to push in Fat Man. And to the extent that we’re getting differential responses in those cases, says Greene, it’s due to the fact that the emotional part of our brain response mechanism is activated by the up close and personal nature of the fat man case, and as a result, we give an answer that he thinks remains morally unjustified. And you’ll recall that his argument there proceeded as follows. When we were first starting to learn our clickers, we were presented with the famous Asian disease case, which is the case that runs as follows. Remember I talked last class about putting a skin on your phone so that it’s easily recognizable, that gives you heuristic access to which phone is yours. And the third of these– I’m actually really curious, and so I want to see how the clicker numbers come out. Of the 10 million people who make use of this product, 10 of them will have a reaction to it of a kind that will cause them to die. If 10 people are going to die from what you’re doing, don’t do it. Even so, there is resistance to cap and trade. Now, it’s an interesting phenomenon that resistance to this sort of reasoning happens depending on the content  from both the right and the left. In the 1970s, it was common for advocates of the buildup of nuclear arsenals to make appeal to a notion called “mutually assured destruction” that we’ll talk about when we talk about the prisoners’ dilemma. And let’s see how those numbers come out. And you jump out of the line, and the bear eats the person behind you. Now what Sorensen and Boorse bring out in their article is how resilient this phenomenon is, regardless of how you mess around with the framing of the cases. There’s a bullet coming towards you, and your choice is to leap aside or to pull somebody in front of you as a way of avoiding the bullet. And you have one of two things that you do. You’re trying to signal to an airplane above you to come and pick you up. Sorensen gives case after case about this. Question: Did Unlucky Alert do something morally blameworthy? And the reason you’re inclined to think that he did nothing wrong in that case, I suspect, is because your judgment in that case, as Mill said, is regulated by a principle to which you tacitly subscribe. You can say that luck can play some role in moral evaluation. Now, it seems like that third response might work for the classic cases of moral luck which I’ve been describing, cases which we would call resultant luck, where there’s luck in the outcome of the action."
761,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-17,"Professor Gendler begins with a discussion of differing responses to hypothetical and actual examples, and offers an actual example of a Trolley Problem. Then, the central topic of the lecture, punishment, is presented. After offering a characterization of what civil punishment involves, Professor Gendler discusses various justifications that have been offered of the practice. She distinguishes between justifications that are forward-looking and those that are backward-looking, and between justifications that are primarily victim-directed and those that are primarily offender-directed. These outlooks are then connected to the moral views that have been presented in earlier lectures: Utilitarianism and deontology","So what I want to do in today’s lecture is to move us onto a topic not unrelated to the one that we were addressing before March break. Individuals considered in isolation are always in interaction with others. More than twice as many of you, looking at these numbers, 31 percent, as opposed to 15 percent, think that it’s morally mandatory in the actual case to redirect the plume. 15 percent of you, actually 13 percent of you, thought it was prohibited in the actual case. So I’m going to ask what it is that we mean, when we talk about civil or criminal punishment. So let’s start with the first of these questions. So the first thing, the first characteristic, the one perhaps most salient when we think about punishment, is that punishment is something that involves a certain kind of unpleasantness or suffering. All of these involved unpleasantness and suffering. In the amazing description of the three horses from Plato’s Phaedrus that we read at the beginning of the semester, the charioteer, in his effort to direct the recalcitrant wild horse, pulls on the bit in a way that brings blood to the mouth of the horse in an effort to inflict punishment. Or, when an individual acts in a way that violates legal or social norms, and others see that the individual has acted in that way, and received no negative consequences from the community as a result, others will be likely to act in that way. So that in some way, the suffering of the individual who is punished on behalf of the state is offset by the benefits to other individuals that will result as a consequence of having caused suffering in one place. But I want to point out that there’s another way of thinking about punishment that we’ll talk about a little bit more in the context of the lecture, which is, you might think about punishment as being a response to a disruption of the social order, in such a way that at least two individuals are involved. The notion behind restitution is that the goal in which the state has legitimate reason to be engaged, is that of taking the innocent party and making sure that they are no worse off after having suffered a crime than before having suffered. Or we might lock up Pedro with the thought–watch the slide, it’s the only joke all lecture–that in so doing, what we provide is justice. And that what punishment does is it reorients the scales of justice, it re-balances things. There are, says Nozick, limits to retribution. And those of you familiar with Austin Powers know that Austin Powers is always able to escape Dr. Evil, because Dr. Evil is so concerned with what we might think about the publicity constraint or the expressive role of revenge."
762,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-18,"The lecture begins with a consideration of the traditional consequentialist account of punishment–-that punishment is justified by its deterrent effect on future crimes. Traditional criticisms of the view are presented, and John Rawls’ two-level justification for punishment is offered as one possible way to avoid such criticisms by bringing together consequentialist and deontological justifications of punishment  in a single theory. Next, Professor Gendler reviews some empirical research on punishment intuitions, including data on moral outrage and the “Knobe effect”. The lecture concludes with a brief discussion of how moral luck interacts with intuitions about punishment.","All right, so where we are in the context of the course is on our second lecture on punishment. So just to remind you what the characterization of punishment that we’re working with looks like, of which the most important clause is going to be the first, we’re making use of the classic mid-century characterization of punishment that comes out of the Anglo-American legal philosophical tradition. The sole  punishment is to prevent or deter future wrongdoing. So let me reiterate, these are empirical questions. Perhaps that has better long-term consequences in terms of preventing future crimes. And the suggestion is that what justifies the practice itself is that having such a practice in place is something of societal utility. So we can distinguish between what it is that sets up our practice, and what it is that happens once our practice has been set up. Those are justified on utilitarian grounds. These are the readings that we did for today. So there’s been, in the last thirty years or so, a vast body of empirical research conducted by a number of extremely sophisticated social psychologists who have looked both at people’s responses to hypothetical cases and at the legal codes of numerous societies in an attempt to get not at the normative question, what should justify punishment, but at an answer to the descriptive question, what psychological human need does punishment address. That is, that a utility calculus doesn’t seem to be the primary motivation when individuals who are surveyed in psychology studies, or penal codes, are looked at as indications, of the psychological mechanism that underlie punishment. I might punish him by inviting everybody that stands behind him to cut in front of both of us. And Jim walks in the door and knocks over my prize umbrella in a way that causes him to stamp through it and poke a hole in my umbrella. And what Carlsmith and Darley suggest, in the article that we read for today, is that these attitudes of either no moral outrage, low moral outrage, or high moral outrage direct our attention to different parties in the episode. But in the case–and in a moment I’m going ask you to take out your clickers because we’re going to talk about intentional action. The question is this: in starting that program–“I don’t care at all about harming the environment, I just care about making a profit”–is it the case that the chairman harmed the environment intentionally? I know you can’t do that, but try to do it anyway. That’s perplexing if what’s going on here is that punishment is supposed to be tracking intentional action. So he doesn’t succeed at his intended crime. And a nine in ten chance of getting to jail."
763,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-19,"In the opening part of the lecture, Professor Gendler concludes her discussion of punishment by exploring how Alan Kazdin’s research on effective parenting provides insights about techniques for rehabilitating individuals who violate societal norms. She then moves to the third large unit of the course: the question of the legitimacy and structure of the state. One answer to the question of state legitimacy–that of Thomas Hobbes–is presented. Hobbes argues that life without a government, in a “state of nature,” would be “nasty, poor, solitary, brutish, and short” as a result of violent competition for resources. To avoid this situation,  Hobbes contends that rational individuals should lay down some of their rights in order to receive the benefits of a centralized state, to the extent that others are also willing to do so.","The first is to finish up briefly our discussion of punishment from last lecture. And you’ll remember from Plato’s , the text with which we begin and with which we’ll end the course, that Plato sees there being a direct parallel between the individual and the community, between what’s mandated for the harmonious soul on the one hand, and what’s required for a community to stay stable on the other. And then we looked at two families of justification for civil punishment. And it’s to that question that Alan Kazdin’s discussion in the context of this encoding of cultural practices in the parenting guide that we read. So Kazdin points out that if your goal is something akin to rehabilitation, if the goal of punishment is what forward-looking theories suggest, that is the changing of future behavior on the part on the individual who has violated social norms in such a way that you can predictably expect them to behave prosocially, then it’s incredibly important not merely to articulate what sort of behavior is disallowed, but also to provide an articulation of what sort of behavior is desired. “ You need to develop another way of behaving. ”You’ll recall long ago, we had a picture of Ulysses trying to get past the sirens. And that was a slide that we looked at in the context of how you overcome immediate temptation. Thinking about punishment in its broadest sense gives us a way of thinking about that question from yet another direction. The best thing to do injustice without paying the penalty. The text we read is from Hobbes’ 1651 book . And in a somewhat coy argument, he suggests that everybody thinks himself to be somewhat clever, and that the best evidence of rough equality is that each is contented with his share. ”It’s important to think about how many features–in fact, all the features of your daily life–rely on an assumption of a certain kind of stability, a certain kind of predictability. Hobbes says that argument works regardless of whether the state of nature is actually something that happened. The question, says Hobbes, is what manner of life there  were there no common power to fear. They depend on there being rules which can be violated and rules which can be upheld. And this is where the trick of Hobbes’ reasoning takes place. And the second law of nature gives voice to how that first clause is to be satisfied. So Hobbes’ solution is the following: He says men naturally love liberty and dominion over others, they recognize that the cost of this is the miserable condition of war."
764,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-1,"Professor Gendler explains the interdisciplinary nature of the course: work from philosophy, psychology, behavioral economics, and literature will be brought to bear on the topic of human nature. The three main topics of the course are introduced–happiness and flourishing, morality, and political philosophy–and examples of some of the course’s future topics are discussed.","So, welcome to Philosophy and the Science of Human Nature. So the course has this perplexing cross-listed title. So one of the main themes of the course will be to think about how the questions raised by the traditional philosophers that I’ve mentioned already are picked up in the contemporary cognitive science tradition. We’ll talk about the tragedy of the commons, and in the closing section of the course, we’ll talk about the role of rhetoric and argument in political persuasion. We’re going to read a short excerpt from the Iliad; we’re going to read a short story by Ursula LeGuin; and in the second to last lecture of the course, we’ll look at what Plato has to say about the role of literature and artistic representation in affecting human self-understanding. When the parts of their souls that might pull in different directions are in a certain kind of harmony; and the ancient picture is that when that happens, human beings behave in a moral way. So even if you’ve shopped only for today, you’ll have a chance to hear some Plato. ”“When he realized this, he arranged to become one of the messengers sent to report to the king. So as I said, we don’t have the clickers, but a vast majority of the class believes that it’s either permitted or required to divert the trolley. We have a very, very different spread this time. Suppose there is a bear running towards you. In the bear case, when you duck, and he gets the guy behind you, the guy behind you dies, and you live. Is there really a moral difference between ducking in such a way that a harm that was heading towards you hit somebody else instead, and shields you, so that a harm that is heading towards you is visited upon someone else instead? So that’s the second set of examples that I want to give you, a topic that we’ll be addressing. A third way of getting around these sorts of problems involves automatizing the behavior that you wish to encourage. One of the assignments involves designing a week of a future version of this course. We will make an effort to make these settings where you can genuinely engage with the material and with one another. Everything in the course is done electronically; so all assignments for the course are to be submitted on the Classes*v2 server under assignments. But everything for the class, in terms of submission and return of exercises, will be done online on our v2 site."
765,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-20,"Two game theoretical problems–the Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Problem of the Commons–are explored in detail. Both collective decision-making scenarios are structured such that all parties making rational choices ensures a less desired outcome for each than if each had chosen individually-less-preferred options. To conclude, Professor Gendler discusses various strategies that can be used to address both problems.Prisoner’s Dilemma online game","So, what I want to talk about today in lecture is a game theoretic notion known as The Prisoners’ Dilemma, which can be used to characterize a structure that is brought out both in Book Two of Plato’s  and in chapter 13 of Hobbes’ .And the purpose of introducing you to this way of thinking about questions is exactly what we have been doing all semester long. So you’ll recall at the beginning of the last lecture that I started off with a quote from the beginning of Book Two of Plato’s  when Glaucon is answering Socrates’ challenge to articulate the nature and origins of justice–the nature and origins of, roughly speaking, pro-social behavior. ”And we illustrated that with the example of the two shepherds, one of whom steals another’s horses and gains a certain amount of pleasure from it, but not as much as the displeasure that the stolen fellow receives likewise when the second steals the first. It is rational when you think there is no choice but to cooperate, to cooperate. But if you think you can get away with having the other person cooperate while you act in a non-cooperative fashion, it would be insane for you to cooperate. ”We’re going to be using the clickers after the next slide, so if you get your clickers out you’ll be prepared for that. So the Prisoners’ Dilemma is a way of representing in graphic form the structure to which both Glaucon and Hobbes adverted. Or she can reserve for herself the right to war and thereby produce in her challenger a feeling of threat throughout. Or, they can both be in a state of war with one another. Or it can be the case that A, the letter on the left refers to A, behaves peacefully, whereas B behaves in a war-like fashion. Ninety-two percent of you on eternity on the internet have given a rational answer, and 8% of you forever, anonymously, will be known to have put yourself in situation one. So what we have is a situation where A determines the row, sorry, where B determines the column, and chooses the war-like column. If we are in the situation described at the beginning of today’s reading, Hume’s story of two individuals, both of whom would benefit if they put in the effort to drain the swamp outside of their field, neither of whom wants to be the only one to do it, you will get a non-cooperative situation. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Three cows great, four cows, super duper. Suppose this is a representation of the hours in your day. So let’s play our own Tragedy of the Commons game. OK?So, the game is there, 22, 23, 24–I’m going to hold off. I mean, at 30 times 10, you’re way over the $150. You would’ve gotten some money and you got nothing. Decreases in freedom, or decreases in your privileges. So we might on the one hand have mechanisms of enforcement that are intrapersonal."
766,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-21,"The discussion of the legitimacy of government is continued with an introduction to a major 20 century work of political philosophy, John Rawls’ .  Professor Gendler explores John Rawls’ central claims: that “justice is the first virtue of social institutions,” and that the just society is that which rational and self-interested individuals would choose for themselves from behind a “veil of ignorance” (that is, not knowing what role in society they would occupy). The lecture concludes with an exploration of two substantive principles of justice which Rawls derives from his framework: the equal liberty principle, and the difference principle.","OK, so as you know, we’ve moved in our discussion to the question of what sort of social structures are either legitimate or contributory to the well being of humans, given our nature. Where if they were somehow to find themselves in a situation where they could cooperate and trust themselves to cooperate, their energy could be devoted, instead of to the protection of their goods, to the production of other sorts of goods. And in the last two lectures we looked at the writings of Thomas Hobbes in the context of his work, , which explored both why it is that the cooperation dividend is expected to be to the advantage of all and also why it is that in order to hold cooperation in place, certain sorts of external enforcement mechanisms–in Hobbes’s mind, a Leviathan, a monarch or leader who has absolute power–is required to hold this sort of cooperation in place. If there are cooperation dividends, that is good and produces a reason for cooperation. And it may well be the case that the benefits that accrue to the social system go to someone else. So hold up, a little more fact and then some fun. He says, “The principles of justice,” of the basic structure of society, “are those that free and rational persons concerned to further their self-interest would accept in an original position of equality as defining the fundamental terms of their association”That is there are four fundamental ideas that underlie this picture. Some of us were born with certain sets of natural talents; others were born with other sets. From this position, where you don’t know which person you are going to be, you get the fourth of our four requirements. Hobbes says to you: When you think about political structures, think about yourself as not being different from everyone else. And you don’t know which section you’re going to be in. Housing lottery two, there are four very good and one terrible room. Hospital three, four very good, one so-so doctor. What society do you choose from behind the veil of ignorance?And Rawls is very clear that the society that you choose has two basic commitments. Or you might think that what free, rational, self-interested equal persons would accept as fundamental terms of association is what the veil of ignorance gives you, but that doesn’t determine what’s just. Or you might think–and we’ll consider this answer in our lecture on Thursday–that it’s not the case that the first virtue of social institutions is justice. And we’ll turn to that question in our lecture on Thursday."
767,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-22,"Robert Nozick’s  is presented as a counterpoint to Rawls’ . In contrast to Rawls, who puts justice at the center of his theory, Nozick maintains that the primary notion should be rights or liberties. With that assumption in place, Nozick argues that a minimal state is the only just state, and that any state more extensive violates fundamental liberties. Professor Gendler proceeds to introduce and discuss the central elements of the seventh chapter of : the notions of justice in acquisition, justice in transfer, and the Lockean Proviso. The lecture concludes with an examination of Nozick’s well-known Wilt Chamberlain argument, by which he attempts to justify his claim that state-sponsored economic redistribution is unjust.","So the topic of today’s lecture, as you can see from the title, is liberty. And the best way to get a sense of the project in which we will find ourselves engaged today is to contrast the opening pages of Rawls’s  with the opening pages of Nozick’s So you’ll recall that when we were reading the Rawls–for some reason the remote is not working, that’s a pity but there we go–you’ll recall that when we were reading the Rawls, Rawls began his text by speaking of justice as the first virtue of social institutions. Nozick is also concerned with a kind of inviolability. They were written a mere three years apart. And we’ll talk about Nozick’s views on justice in acquisition in a minute. If I wanted to provide an inductive definition of the natural numbers, I might begin by saying “one is a member of the set of natural numbers.” It’s only under two conditions that holdings are just on Nozick’s picture. That is, it is a necessary condition on justice in holding that they have been acquired through one of these two steps. For this labor being the unquestionable property of the laborer, no man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to, at least when there is enough, and as good, left in common for others. Because if that Proviso were frequently violated then justice in acquisitions wouldn’t be simple and straightforward in the way that Nozick wants it to be. Locke has a reasonable picture of what acquisition of property involves. But we still might wonder whether the blue character has violated the Lockean Proviso. So as we noted, Nozick provides his defense of the base clause by appeal to Locke’s notion of original acquisition of property and defends that against the potential objection–the Lockean Proviso objection–in providing a clearer sense of what that amounts to. And he contrasts those with what he calls  principles where, whether a distribution is just depends upon how things are distributed. And they also want their society to  just. Must the look of justice, asks Nozick, reside in a resulting pattern, which we can specify independently and in advance rather than in the underlying generating principles?And to think about this, it’s helpful to help ourselves to a three-way distinction that John Rawls makes in the context of Theory of Justice. To maintain a pattern, says Nozick, one must either interfere to stop people from transferring resources as they wish to."
768,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-23,"Professor Gendler begins by recapping the topic of state legitimacy and then offers a way of understanding the disagreement between Rawls and Nozick as one over what states ought to do given the phenomena of moral luck. She then turns to a discussion of how social and cultural structures influence both our characters and our perception of the world. She begins by discussing ways in which this theme plays a role in the work of Aristotle and John Stuart Mill. She then discusses recent empirical work on this question, including a body of anthropological and psychological literature that suggests that individuals raised in societies that are Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic have highly atypical responses in a wide range of cases.","So what I want to do in the first part of this lecture is just finish our discussion of liberty from last time, beginning by saying a couple of additional clarificatory things about the particular pages from Nozick that we read, and then moving on to explaining what I think is an important way that Nozick and Rawls are confronting one of the problems that each of the thinkers that we have addressed has confronted, namely, the problem of luck in determining human experience. And this is the idea that sometimes property is illegitimately acquired, either initially or as the result of an illegitimate transfer. We noted at the end of our lecture last time that there might be a society in which there’s an equal distribution of wealth across individuals and a social interaction among them with regard to the institutions that prepare people to become democratic citizens. But  a conflict of interests, since people are not indifferent to how those goods are distributed. It permits distributive shares to be improperly influenced by factors that are so arbitrary from a moral point of view. And utility enjoins in keeping with that, says Mill, that “education and opinion, which have so vast a power over human character, should so use that power as to establish in the mind of every individual and indissoluble association between his own happiness and the good of the whole. So if you get your clickers out I’ll tell you some facts and then you can tell me some responses. So the first piece that we read for today is a long survey article from the journal , in which the authors survey a century’s worth of anthropological and psychological research in an attempt to bring empirical force to the claim that Mill makes here–that education and opinion, cultural structures, have a vast power over human character. So the first reason we read the article is just to learn some facts about human diversity and similarity. And one of the things that I think this article does beautifully, in particular in conjunction with the second article that we read for today, is to give you a range of tools for thinking about central questions. So 41% of you think it appears that the top is shorter than the bottom. 46% of you, it appears that they are the same length. So you’ll remember when we were reading the Doris critique of Aristotle and the suggestion was made that it’s not features of the individual himself, not attributes of the object, that determine how it is that somebody will act in a potentially morally demanding situation. There are, likewise, cases where focusing our attention profoundly on the object itself and not attending to irrelevant features of the environment will leave us better off. What right has your friend to expect you to protect him? Over and over and over again–and I’ll leave you three more examples on the slide to look at–you see that whatever it is that you are like–if you are like the Japanese with 41% you were different from the Americans, if you were like the Americans with 99%, you were different than the Japanese–the cultural environment in which you find yourself plays a role in determining your outlook."
769,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-24,"Professor Gendler explores some aspects of the question of what sorts of non-rational persuasion are legitimate for a government to engage in. She begins with two modern examples that illustrate Plato’s view on state censorship. She next turns to the text itself and outlines in detail Plato’s argument that since we are vulnerable to non-rational persuasion, and since a powerful source of such persuasion is imitative poetry, such poetry must be censored by the state. Drawing on a number of earlier themes from the course, she then discusses several implications of the fact our limited ability to rationally regulate our non-rational responses to representations makes fiction both potentially powerful, and potentially dangerous.","So our topic today is the general question of what sort of non-rational persuasion is legitimate for a government to engage in if we’re willing to accept the kind of social contract argument that we were considering in the last few weeks of the course. True stories about false stories and their effects. Indeed she didn’t have a long-term partner. Dan Quayle essentially said, “if we want the guardians of our city,” that is the citizens who are in a position to govern and select leadership, “if we want the guardians of our city to think that it’s shameful to be easily provoked into hating another”–read: shameful to bear a child out of wedlock–“then we mustn’t allow stories about the gods,” says Plato–stories about attractive characters on television says Dan Quayle–“warring or plotting against one another.” And to the extent that our  commentators and others in their discussion of the 2008 presidential election were pleased to see an opening up of the range of candidates who were being taken seriously as potential leaders of this nation, they too were channeling Plato, who right after the remark that we just quoted, continues by saying, “If we’re to persuade our people that no citizen has ever hated one another and that it’s impious to do so, then that’s what should be told in our story.” How can something that we know to be fictional affect our actual behaviors and attitudes? The response to the puzzle that gives rise to the concerns that Plato and Dan Quayle and our bloggers articulate, is that the way that fiction causes problems is by affecting the non-rational parts of the soul in ways that are not easily subject to rational regulation or control. And the kind of education that he is concerned with is the education of the non-rational parts of the guardian’s soul. Especially for anything young and tender. We pride ourselves if we’re able to master our grief. And we can see that perhaps most profoundly by contrasting the sort of cases that Plato is worried about with the sort of cases that he is ostensibly not. Now in so doing, it is my sense that I had removed myself from a domain where contagion was a risk. Some fictional representations cause us to bear that to at least part of their content. ’”And later in the article, the reporter goes on to quote an Army official from the office of Defense Modeling and Simulation who says, “The technology in games has facilitated a revolution in the art of warfare. Plato suggests that fiction affects the non-rational parts of the soul in such a way that they are potentially disharmonious with the rational part. Consequently, in an argument much like the one we see in Hobbes, Plato is suggesting in Book Ten that what rationality requires, given our recognition of limits that it hits up against, is a willingness to restrict our freedom in certain ways. Thanks very much and I’ll see those of you who are not visiting Bulldogs on Tuesday."
770,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-25,"Professor Gendler begins with brief introductory remarks about the course’s methodology, explaining the approach that was taken to reading and presenting various articles. She continues with a discussion of Cass Sunstein’s work on social norms, looking particularly at his account of the willingness to pay/willingness to accept distinction. The lecture continues with a consideration of how this distinction-–and the heuristic reasoning that gives rise to it–-might be used to explain our responses to the trolley problem. In the final segment of the lecture, Professor Gendler offers a way of thinking systematically about relations among the political philosophical views of Thomas Hobbes, John Rawls and Robert Nozick.","So today’s lecture is devoted, in some sense, to the tying up of loose ends. I’m going to try to pick out some of the ones that I think will be of general interest and welcome those of you whose questions aren’t answered to come by during office hours. I’m not going to have much to say about that. The social meaning of a compost heap in the 1970s in suburban Massachusetts was one of non-normativity. So the reason that I had you read the Sunstein article in the context of our political philosophy discussion was to point out to you how many more layers of complexity there are when we start thinking about what kind of social structures are legitimate. Next lecture we’ll talk a lot about how to reconcile intuitions about particular cases with more general principled commitment. And we know as a matter of general theory, that the way human–and perhaps even non-human–primate accounting works, that that the cost of accepting something feels higher to us than the cost of paying. System one is automatic whereas system two is controlled. So all three of them are working in what is known as the social contract tradition. Hobbes argues that it is of  utility for us to engage in a social contract. And in so doing come up with something morally worthy. And he suggests that our prudential aim, that which is of use to us, is to escape the state of nature. But, says Hobbes, that gives rise, if we think about the fact that being in the state of nature is bad for us, to a number of rationally mandated conclusions, of which we examined three. So what Nozick is interested in is the question: given that things as a matter of historical contingency happen to end up the way they are in terms of the distribution of goods and in terms of the distribution of contracts, what sort of moral force does that have?Nozick’s goal is to determine whether this distribution of holdings–that is property–and contracts–that is commitment–is a legitimate one. And where just transfers are any that are engaged in voluntarily. So Nozick’s interested in historical situation. But it’s my hope that even if I didn’t answer all 500 of the questions that I was asked for today that the lecture gave you some sense of how some of the pieces fit together."
771,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-26,"In this concluding lecture, Professor Gendler charts four paths through the course. The first path traces how the course’s three main goals were realized: the goals of introducing students to the discipline of Philosophy though a number of central texts; of considering certain central questions raised by those philosophical texts in light of alternative approaches from related disciplines; and of considering more generally the how various disciplines might provide complementary perspectives on important questions. The second path traces how students’ understanding of the main course topics-–happiness and flourishing; morality; and political legitimacy and social structures–might have changed over the course of the semester. The third path traces the course’s main topics in light of three themes that unify the material-–the multi-part soul; luck and control; and the relation between the individual and society. And the fourth path looks at the course in light of three three central quotations, from Plato, Aristotle and Epictetus.","When we first started gathering in this room three and a bit months ago, there was a photo essay in the  with snow everywhere. And the third, the question of the relation between the individual and society. When we thought about how the notion of parts of the soul is manifest in our contemporary idiom, we made use of the work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, the heuristics and biases tradition, as a way of trying to use our vernacular to think about insights that have been part of every wisdom tradition since human civilization began. And we thought about the ways in which the war experience as described in Homer’s and the war experience as described by returning veterans give voice to a common human experience in the face of the loss of a certain sort of structure. You were asked to take a particular article from an empirical psychological journal and to figure out what question it was asking, what alternatives it was considering, what the logic of the argument was, what the methods were that were being used, what the results were and what the implications were. All of those were words on a syllabus page, whose significance to you three months ago was, I hope, less than it is now. All of these are questions worth asking yourself for the rest of your life. And how this work connects with contemporary work in neuroscience and related work in cognitive and social psychology. And we asked ourselves how it is that the fact that we are simultaneously desirous of possessing objects that others possess and desirous of being able to be in a position of security with respect to that to which we have become attached, we discovered that there was a mathematical representation, game theory’s notion of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, that could illuminate Plato’s discussion in the opening pages of book two of the  and Hobbes’s discussion in chapter thirteen of  of the ways in which social structures come into being legitimately. And we asked ourselves how work in social psychology and behavioral economics might shed additional light on these fundamental questions. And we noticed, in an uncanny way, that Dan Quayle’s remarks about Murphy Brown and the Madden video games’ views about displaying concussions in online gaming were echoing almost verbatim the words of Plato from book ten of the  when he discussed poetry and censorship. What enabled you to carry through with your commitments? But almost none of you thought it was acceptable, if a bear is running towards you, to take the person from behind you and put them in front of you as a shield. On the one hand, Lucky Alert and Lucky Cell Phone. One, a person who did nothing wrong drove home and harmed no one. In so doing, oh holders of clickers, do you do something morally blameworthy?And let’s see how these numbers come out. So in contrast to your previous assessment, where in the case of Unlucky Alert, 81% of you thought he did something morally blameworthy, now only 36% of you do. But it’s worth thinking about why that happened."
772,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-2,"After introducing Plato’s Republic, Professor Gendler turns to the discussion of Glaucon’s challenge in Book II. Glaucon challenges Socrates to defend his claim that acting justly (morally) is valuable in itself, not merely as a means to some other end (in this case, the reputation one gets from seeming just). To bolster the opposing position–that acting justly is only valuable as a means to attaining a good reputation–Glaucon sketches the thought experiment of the Ring of Gyges. In the second half of the lecture, Professor Gendler discusses the experimental results of Daniel Batson, which suggest that, at least in certain controlled laboratory settings, people appear to care more about seeming moral than about actually acting fairly. These experimental results appear to support Glaucon’s hypothesis in the Ring of Gyges thought experiment.","So today’s lecture is about the question of the challenge that Glaucon posed in the story of the ring of Gyges. Several of his uncles had been part of a coup in the government that took place several years before Plato came to maturity. Whereas that is a story of death for the sake of faith, Socrates’s story is a story of death for the sake of reason. As I said again, only a century ago, many of them retrieved only during and after the First World War. The nature of knowledge, the nature of truth, the nature of love, the nature of friendship, and so on., And the conversation that we hear takes place first between Socrates and Glaucon, and then between Socrates and Adeimantus. But we’re, of course, not reading off the Oxyrhynchus papyrus. There are three questions that Glaucon wants to answer. How is it that people come to behave in cooperative ways, and what is it that we speak of when we talk about the norms of justice?This is a topic that we’ll discuss when we get to Hobbes, and so I’m not going to say more today about the particular argument that Glaucon offers there. Is morality, for you, something merely like taking medicine? And the other task is described as kind of dull, and each correct answer that you give will not result in your being entered in the lottery. The next number is the one that gives us the surprising results. ”But here’s what’s striking; 90% of the people flipped the coin, assigned themselves to the positive condition, and rate themselves as having acted in an extraordinarily moral way: seven on a scale of nine, with respect to how morally they behave. But what can one do to induce in people prosocial moral behavior?Here’s the extraordinary next study that Batson did. That he would tell the story of how it is that we can expect somebody to behave if he conceives of himself as unobserved–the story of our shepherd, who finds the ring of invisibility, and when he gets it, takes over the kingdom–is the story that Batson’s research tells us about an inclination on the part of human beings. There is a worrisome tendency on the part of at least those about whom these stories are told. Contemporary American college students in Kansas seem to bear that out."
773,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-3,"Professor Gendler reviews four instances of intrapersonal divisions that have appeared in philosophy, literature, psychology, and neuroscience: Plato’s division between reason, spirit, and appetite; Hume’s division between reason and passion; Freud’s division between id, ego, and superego; and four divisions discussed by Jonathan Haidt (mind/body, left brain/right brain, old brain/new brain, and controlled/automatic thought). A discussion of a particularly vivid passage from Plato’s Phaedrus concludes the lecture.","So today’s lecture is a lecture about the parts of the soul. And this is the story of Leontius, and it goes as follows. ’”Now, we’ll talk more in today’s lecture about the particular picture that Plato has in mind when he speaks of the tripartite soul as involving this force that he calls appetite. Listen up,” says Oprah, on Oprah’s webpage, “Why Being in your Heart is Better than in your Bead.” And Jonathan Haidt, in the book that we read the first chapter of today, presents a wonderful metaphor there, for understanding the relation between, on the one hand, reason–the part of ourselves to which we have direct, conscious access, and over which we have direct regulative control–and the other mass of drives and instincts which compose us, which he suggests we can understand as an elephant which we seek to control through whatever mechanisms are possible. So we have this bundle of passions that pull us in various directions. And on top of that, as we develop, comes a part of ourselves which is sensitive to reality. Now, there are details of the Freudian picture which have been discredited for all sorts of reasons. And if you go on YouTube, you can actually watch a live version of Mike the headless chicken. And so he selects with his left hand, controlled by the right brain from the left visual field, a shovel, something which would be enormously useful if you had snow. So one side of his brain sees a chicken claw, and selecting the thing that goes with it, selects the chicken. The third division which Haidt describes to us is the division between what he calls old brain and new brain. And the result of the accident which happened to Gage was like what happened to the University of Virginia schoolteacher that Haidt describes in his story. In so doing, you set up associations between being on the couch and a negative outcome, and you change her associations with it. And you’re asked to put four of them into a sentence. The first is what he calls reason, or ; this is represented here by the chariots here. So what the , the book from which we’ve been reading excerpts, describes is a process by which the rational part of ourselves can come to be in control of our spirits and our appetites."
774,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-4,"Professor Gendler begins with a demonstration of sampling bias and a discussion of the problems it raises for empirical psychology. The lecture then returns to divisions of the soul, focusing on examples from contemporary research. The first are dual-processing accounts of cognition, which are introduced along with a discussion of the Wason selection task and belief biases. Next, the influential research of Kahneman and Tversky on heuristics and biases is introduced alongside the famous Asian disease experiment. Finally, Professor Gendler introduces her own notion of alief and offers several examples that distinguish it from belief.Daniel Kahneman’s Nobel Prize Lecture: “Maps of Bounded Rationality”  ","So what I would like you to do is to answer the following question. “ This error is an incredibly dangerous one, and it could have persisted. So when we do psychological empirical research, we need to be extraordinarily careful that the means by which we are choosing subjects for experiments are, in fact, means that give us an accurate sample of what it is that we’re interested in. And in other ways, this is a class about Western philosophy and the science of Western human nature. And also to a number of other distinctions. And today’s lecture will take up where the last lecture left off, with another way in which it is typical to distinguish parts of the soul. This is from the New York Public Library Archive. So, for example, you might be told:, No Greek tragedies are comedies. Notice, however, that these two arguments are structurally identical. They both have a form, no A’s are B’s, some C’s are B’s, therefore, some C’s are not A’s. So you notice that the second one is different from the first in two ways. So read about plan A. And now read about plan B. OK. I need to learn a little bit more about how to use clickers. When you’re asked which one you choose, the excellent looms large, and so you go for it, neglecting the high cholesterol. When you’re asked which one you give up, the high cholesterol looms larger. Suppose you’re going to a movie, and when you get to the theater, you discover that you’ve lost something from your wallet. But people are in fact pulled in two directions. And you step out there with me, and you voluntarily remain there. You have a belief that it’s a rerun, and your alief says “don’t run”. Any of you who have ever rearranged your room knows this feeling. Likewise, talk of system one, system two, relatively autonomous systems, heuristics biases and so on, don’t fit naturally into the way that we have of talking about ourselves."
775,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-5,"Professor Gendler begins with a poll of the class about whether students have elected to take a voluntary no-Internet pledge, and distributes stickers to help students who have made the pledge stick to their resolve. She then moves to the substantive part of the lecture, where she introduces Plato’s analogy between the city-state and the soul and articulates Plato’s response to Glaucon’s challenge: justice is a kind of health–the well-ordered working of each of the parts of the individual—and thus is intrinsically valuable. This theme is explored further via psychological research on the ‘progress principle’ and ‘hedonic treadmill,’ as well as in an introduction to Aristotle’s argument that reflection and reasoning are the function of humanity and thus the highest good.Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s TED talk “Flow” ","So the clicker question that I want to ask you right now is–ah, shoot! Just thinking it didn’t make a pre-commitment. Now my next question for you is whether you have strayed. It’ll be there to remind you and to show your peers. Plato’s suggestion is that a certain kind of happiness is available to us if we get these parts into line. And in honor of the weather, we’ll represent the human being like this. What societal structures can help us understand things about the internal structures of human beings?So he proposes the famous city-state analogy, whereby corresponding to the part of the soul that he calls appetite are citizens of the city that he calls workers, or people who do the day-to-day work of the city, and who take their joy and pleasure from the pleasures of the body and of the appetite. And the wisdom of the city and of the individual is to be found in its rational part. So those three arguments are Glaucon’s arguments in favor of justice being something with only instrumental value. But in addition, he argues that there is a certain intrinsic worth associated with having one’s soul structured in the way that the just soul is. So just as health is of both intrinsic and instrumental value to us in the body, so too is justice, which is the health of the soul, of both intrinsic and instrumental value to us as spiritual in addition to physical beings. And we have a picture of what health amounts to. So, too, says Plato, the excavation project that he’s engaged in thinking about the city-state analogy brings out what it would be for a soul to be healthy, and it turns out that health for the soul is to be arranged in the way that justice mandates. And this theme is, in fact, a central theme of almost every religious tradition. Now, this idea that we can take some of the common wisdom about the nature of happiness, but recognize that it captures only part of the truth, is one of the things, one of the many things, that’s going on in the passages from Jonathan Haidt that I had you read for today. So this is just to like re-engage you in case you zoned out, because I’ve been jabbering, and the clickers are supposed to keep you talking . This clock was supposed to start automatically; we already have 118 of you. I don’t know why they put Plato and Aristotle on the “Come to the writing center,” but I might as well tell you what’s going on in this picture. No,” says Aristotle, and he gives some reasons for that. And a good one of those things is one which does its function well. Its function is that which set it apart from other entities. So the question that we’ll turn to at the beginning of next lecture–and you’re all in a position to read the punchline, in fact, you should have read the punchline for today–is what does the virtue look like that makes us distinctly and most excellently human, and how is it cultivated?So for Thursday, we are reading three really fantastic things."
776,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-6,"Professor Gendler introduces Aristotle’s conception of virtue as a structuring one’s life so that one’s instinctive responses line up with one’s reflective commitments. Becoming virtuous, according to Aristotle, requires that we engage in a process of habituation by acting as if we were virtuous, just as musicians master their instruments by playing them. By contrast, when one’s behavior or experience is out of line with one’s reflective commitments, dissonance ensues. Exemplifying this dissonance are Vietnam veterans with PTSD, whose experiences author Jonathan Shay relates to those of the Greek soldiers in the . In both cases, the reflective commitment to “what’s right”, or , is betrayed by some commanding officers; the consequence is a loss of the possibility of social trust.","So we have quite a bit to do in lecture today, but there are two main things that are going to happen. The person who instinctively sits down and does her reading when she’s committed to do her reading. So what Aristotle tried to do in the segment of the  that we read is to give us a formula, a strategy, a method, for getting to the point of having our soul in order. It’s this feeling that one is living up to the greatest one can be. They have emotional connections that seem to be manifest in their behavior. It’s being such that what happens to you in moments where you’re not paying attention to your behavior is the sort of behavior that you would look back on and say, “Wow, I’m so glad that in the moment of crisis, what I did was help that child”. They are things that you process in the spirited and appetitive parts of your soul as the result of a kind of cultivation of habit. No matter how many times I try to train my glasses to stay in the air, they will fall to the ground. Those would be things that are against nature. “Virtues of character arise in us neither by nature nor against nature. I become a builder by practicing the art of building. Between these, says Aristotle, lies the virtue of friendliness. You could be ostentatious in what you do. One, the  and the Vietnam war, as read through the writings of Jonathan Shay, two, the experiments of Stanley Milgram, done here on this campus in the 1960s, both of which give us a window into what human experience looks like in Glaucon’s dream world. Or three if the closest person you know who served in the military is like a kid from your school, or a neighbor, or somebody that you don’t know very well. OK.So almost none of you have a sibling or best friend who is in the military. I’m asking you about your father because we need a one to one. She carried on a large naval training unit, commissioned officers for the Navy. And Shay’s thesis in this book, as you know, is that when a leader destroys the legitimacy of the army’s moral order by betraying what he calls –what’s right, the order of things, the structure by which we can understand the world as predictable and well-ordered–in so doing, injuries are inflicted on the soldiers that are not physical injuries. And the disorderliness that is typical of nonconventional warfare, of which Vietnam is an example and terrorism is a second, is something that you produces in societies as a whole some kind of approximation of the post-traumatic stress disorder that Shay identifies in the soldiers."
777,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-7,"The discussion of the disordered soul continues with a reflection on the Stanley Milgram’s famous studies, in which participants were directed to perform harmful actions that ran counter to their reflective moral commitments. Interestingly, such demands were more likely followed when the commander was closer to the subject and the victim further away. What is it about proximity to others that has this effect on us? Professor Gendler goes on to discuss the relationship between social attachment and human flourishing, reviewing Harlow’s wire mother/cloth mother experiments on non-human primates, studies of attachment styles in infants, and cross-cultural research demonstrating the importance of social relationships for flourishing and health.","So I want to begin today by continuing at the point where we left off the in the previous lecture. ”So when people answered this advertisement, they were invited to come to a building whose exterior should be familiar to you. Which is the discussion of what it felt like, subjectively, to these subjects, when they felt themselves to be perpetrating painful behavior on another. That on the one hand, we seem to have a sense of what we can comfortably put up with. That capacity can be exploited for the good or for the bad. And monkey after monkey after monkey did what you see in this picture. So one might wonder, as Harlow’s student John Bowlby and his collaborator, Mary Ainsworth, did, whether there’s anything that can be said about what’s required for human beings to flourish that can be learned from the picture that we see in the Harlow wire baby cloth baby studies. The first, which she called , results from early childhood experience that involves predictable responsiveness to one’s needs by somebody who feels affection for you. So there’s a sense that develops that the world is not a safe and cooperative place. Nonetheless, it has served as the basis for one of the most extraordinary scientific studies conducted in the last century, which is a thirty-year longitudinal study conducted by people who took attachment theory seriously, who looked at the extent to which predictors of subsequent flourishing could be traced to early childhood experience. So we can’t go back and look at what your childhoods were like. Here’s one about social integration and mortality in France. In every culture, which anybody has looked at, social engagement is crucial to human flourishing. So Harrow and Bowlby and Ainsworth and the Minnesota study have pointed out that in order for human beings to develop the kind of trusting relationships that enables a society even to get off the ground, it’s crucial that there be a certain sort of stable social connection in infancy."
778,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-8,"Professor Gendler begins with a discussion of the Stoic philosopher Epictetus, who argued that once we recognize that some things are up to us and other things are not up to us, we can see that happiness requires detaching ourselves from our desires and focusing instead on our attitudes and interpretations. Three pieces of advice from Epictetus about how to cultivate such detachment are provided, along with contemporary examples. A similar theme from Boethius is discussed, followed by a practical example of the benefits of detachment from Admiral James Stockdale’s experiences as a prisoner of war.","So what I want to talk about in today’s lecture is a strand in the philosophical tradition that looks not at the ways in which human interconnectedness can provide meaning and the possibility for flourishing, but which looks rather at a certain sort of psychological detachment as a way of dealing with the inevitable vicissitudes of lived experience. But he eventually gained freedom, and at some point, either before or after gaining freedom, he studied the works and philosophical outlook of a tradition known as Stoicism. He has views about everything, and his commitments are to a certain kind of rationalist, formalist, idealist philosophy. And we’ve been introduced to the works of Aristotle through one of his writings, the .But alongside those two traditions, the Platonic tradition and the Aristotelian tradition, the ancient philosophical world produced a number of other systematic philosophical outlooks–outlooks that had views about almost any question you could ask. Now, Epictetus, in , is concerned only with a small portion of the Stoic picture. We need also to anticipate the way the world typically unfolds. So those are the three things that Epictetus says we need to do with respect to perception, and again, I’ll give examples of each of them in a moment. But the world refused to cooperate on that question. Epictetus points out to us that we have a skill set for letting go. And as a consequence, “no one can coerce you,” because you’re only concerned about the things that are up to you. “ There are people who splash, there are people who jostle, there are people who are insulting. It’s not attached to an event that it is good or bad. So contemporary philosophy has a way of describing this. But you must keep your mind fixed on the boat, and look around frequently, in case the captain calls. Sometimes things start off badly and get better. And recognizing that there is nothing to be done, other than to recognize that this is the pattern that life takes, is, to Boethius, enormously liberating. My character and my response to those things are up to me. ”So the question that Stockdale’s text raises for us is the question of whether it is possible for us to take on board some of the Epictetan picture without taking on all of it."
779,philosophy,phil-181,lecture-9,"We become virtuous by acting as if we are virtuous. This central insight of Aristotle is explored in this lecture. Professor Gendler begins by explaining how Aristotle’s method can allow us to turn normative laws–which describe how we  act–into descriptive laws–which describe how we  act. But what practical strategies are available to help us turn our reflective behavior (acting as if virtuous) into automatic behavior (being virtuous)? To address this question, Professor Gendler explores a number of surprising parallels between Pavlovian conditioning of animals, successful parenting strategies, and techniques for acquiring virtue by habit.","So today’s lecture is about the claim that we’ve been exploring in the context of Aristotle’s ethics, that the way to cultivate virtue is by cultivating in ourselves certain sorts of habits. It wouldn’t be funny have a T-shirt that said, “Look both ways before crossing the street: It’s not just a good idea, it’s the law.” They are laws in the sense that you find over at the Yale Law School. That you have no habitual behaviors that you would like to change? But 92% of you have at least one habit that you would like to change. But with regard to this hypothesis, that mistaken assumption doesn’t make a difference.)So the way classical conditioning works, is that before the conditioning takes place, you identify an item–say, food–that produces in the being that you wish to condition a response of salivation, in this case, or excitement. You take your dog, and you present him with, simultaneously, the bell and the food. Human beings are capable of coming to have associations that have valence, either positive or negative, associations that produce in them positive or negative emotional responses. So I can provide you with positive reinforcement for desired behavior. So we can increase behaviors that we want to increase by associating with them consequences that serve to increase the value, subjectively, that that behavior has to the individual, as the result of pairing something that the individual likes already with the behavior. So when I eat chocolate cake, that is associated with the positive consequence of the flavor that it provides me. But it may not be so salient to me that the behavior also gives rise to a consequence which I don’t evaluate so positively. So we can take behaviors that occur, that we want to have more of, and associate them with positive consequences. And finally, we can give rise to behavior differentially by the presence or absence of what are called , that indicate, in technical terminology, the availability of a reinforcer. And one of the most effective ways to do that is to structure experience so that the thing we don’t want to do is incompatible with an alternative behavior that we put in its place. And the two essays that we’re reading for next class bring out a complication to the story that I’ve told today, and they ask us stop to think about whether this entirely describes what it is that’s required for bringing about the kind of change which we hope to achieve."
780,physics,phys-200,lecture-10,Part II of Rotations. The lecture begins with an explanation of the Parallel Axis Theorem and how it is applied in problems concerning rotation of rigid bodies. The moment of inertia of a disk is discussed as a demonstration of the theorem. Angular momentum and angular velocity are examined in a variety of problems.,"I thought I should summarize for you the main points, because you learned a whole lot of stuff, but you don’t have to carry all that in your head. So, we were going to do rotation of rigid bodies, which are forced to lie on the  plane. For a continuous distribution of matter like this one, the sum is replaced by an integral. Then, if you want to change this angular momentum, it’s like asking, “How do you change the ordinary momentum of a particle?” So, you can also write analogously here,  because if you take the  of this guy, that’s a constant, and  is a rate of change of .The last thing I have to tell you is what is the torque of the total torque on a body. I’ll tell you the answer once and for all. So, this is the proof of the Parallel Axis Theorem. But ′ squared, you can see, is the length of  +  dot, product with  + , using the result I established above. Stick the pin through that and rotate it. It is /2, that’s the answer through the center plus , where  is simply the distance from the center of mass to where you set your axis. You know that given all the masses that it’s something, some right here, that’s the center of mass, . Let’s look at a cross term, the 2 cancels the half; then, I get this capital  which can be pulled out of the summation,  relative, summed over all the particles. But in reality, a body can translate and rotate. Throw anything you want in the air, it will spin or move and also rotate. Treat it like a point, and associate an energy with its motion. They can be subject to any force, external forces, internal forces, whatever you like. You can think of the problem as either a disk or as a cylinder. In a car that’s moving the way we like it, there’s a correlation between the angular velocity and the linear velocity. And when it’s rolling without slipping, I think you have an intuitive feeling. So, every part of the tire touches the ground; then, that comes down and that comes down, and when it goes all the way to this end, it has also finished one full revolution. But let’s calculate the velocity when you roll without slipping. When you roll without slipping, the velocity of the center of mass, which is always denoted by , is equal to  divided by the time to make one full revolution. Now, in that case, let’s find the kinetic energy of an automobile tire that’s rolling without slipping. But what do you notice about this formula? I want you to think about what the formula suggests to you. You can see the rotational motion on the top adds to the speed of the car. See, if it rolls without slipping, then you will be traveling slower at the foot of the ramp. But I was not planning to put this guy in the platform, so I just used a random symbol. So, we know from the old days that if you want to find what’s happening with the mass, you should draw free-body diagram with a downward force , and some tension  on the rope. When you look at the free-body diagram for the pulley, our tension , is acting down here. But I’m not going to bother to write that. That has to be the acceleration of this mass also, because the rope is being given out at a certain rate and that’s the same. Now, I’m going to subject it to another stringent test. So, if you wanted to say energy is conserved, we know what we want. I think by now you recognize this is the kinetic energy of the pulley. is the number that connects linear to angular quantities. That’s another thing I want to tell you with this. Anyway, I think you can see here the advantage of working with symbols. They stick together and travel as a unit. I mean, angle of momentum, , because of moment of inertia and angular velocity. So, when a body comes with a tangential momentum , and it plants itself on the disk, it actually is an angular momentum  times . So, the surprising thing for you guys is, things don’t have to be going around in a circle to have an angular momentum. The angular velocity is easiest to find when this guy is right next to the disk. You know from what we did earlier, angular velocity is linear velocity divided by .Okay, the last problem that I want to do, which I’m not going to do quantitatively, but qualitatively is a very, very interesting problem. But bodies have no way of getting rid of their mass."
781,physics,phys-200,lecture-11,"This lecture is a continuation of an analogue to Newton’s law: τ= lα. While previous problems examined situations in which τ is not zero, this time the focus is on extreme cases in which there is no torque at all. If there is no torque, α is zero and the angular velocity is constant. The lecture starts with a simple example of a seesaw and moves on to discuss a collection of objects that are somehow subject to a variety of forces but remain in static equilibrium.","We’ve been studying the whole time this analogue of Newton’s law: . Well, sometimes it’s of great interest to us that the object has no angular velocity. But that doesn’t mean the body will not move because keeping the center of mass fixed, the body can rotate. This will make sure the center of mass as a whole is not going anywhere. Then there is–Of course, that cannot be the whole story because the seesaw is not going into the ground. That is the support and the normal force from the support. If there is an axis around which a body is rotating, then we know how to take the torques through that axis. So, you can say it’s not rotating through an axis I draw through here. And I want to hold it up by supporting it here with a force . And torque due to gravity is what I want to discuss now. So, just like the other problem, I’m not asking you to find  and . Torque due to force I apply; that torque, is equal to  times the length of the rod because there’s  times r times the sine of the angle between them, and the sine of the angle is 9, the sine of 90, which is one. So, let me make my life easy by dividing by the total mass and multiplying by the total mass. We cancel the , then you find the force  apply is  divided by two. But the pull of gravity is straight down and the separation is horizontal. It’s not going to contribute to the torque equation, but if you push it in, wall’s got to push you out, and  prime will be equal to .In fact, let’s turn to a problem where the support, in fact, exerts a horizontal and vertical force. We know intuitively that any force applied along this direction is no use, in terms of rotating it. But the way, to get the answer most effectively is to take the torque equation, because the beauty of the torque equation is that neither the vertical part nor the horizontal part have anything to do with the pivot enters that. I don’t think it should cause a new problem. You put that in and you solve for the tension ; then go back and, again, do the force part. is the force, the distance is  – the length of the ladder – and this  and that  are equal by some theorem we learned in high school that if you’ve got two parallel lines the angle is the same. So, I want to find the torque due to the force of gravity acting there with respect to this point. So, coming back again, I did this cancellation. should be bigger than 1,  should be bigger than 45 degrees. Maybe I should keep using radians so you guys get used to radians as a way to think about it. So, whenever I did a torque calculation, the torque was either plus something or minus something. I hope you people understand that in three dimensions, even in three dimensions, if  and F are two vectors, you know, they can move around like these two fingers; they define a plane. So, we have to make a choice on what direction I want to associate with this . And that’s where you use the right-hand rule. I want to define the cross product,  cross . But I told you another way to do  dot ,  + . If you write  times  +  times  +  times , cross product with similar things for . Now, I’m going to introduce, for a single point mass somewhere here, an angular momentum, which is also going to be a vector. We just say it’s spinning clockwise or counter-clockwise. Let’s go back to 2D and ask, “What does all of this look like when I apply it to 2D?” If it’s a part of the rigid body, it can only move that way. But now, I want you to think about the following notion. What’s its angular momentum, is what we are asking. It doesn’t have to rotate, is the main point. You remember the internal forces cancelled in pairs. What’s going to happen to the gyro is what we’re asking. So, we say the angular momentum of this rod gets an increment pointing into the board. But if you looked at the stuff we have in Sloane , if you take a big gyro and you spin it, you suspend one end on the tip of a tower and it’s spinning like this, you attach some weight to it, you will find it starts going around. If the gyro is not spinning, it will just fall down."
782,physics,phys-200,lecture-12,"This is the first of a series of lectures on relativity. The lecture begins with a historical overview and goes into problems that aim to describe a single event as seen by two independent observers. Maxwell’s theory, as well as the Galilean and Lorentz transformations are also discussed.","First of all, I’m assuming all of you have some idea what special relativity means. Relativity is not a new idea at all, it’s an old one. Can that be detected?So, at the time of Galileo and Newton everybody agreed that you cannot detect it. And the claim of relativity is that you really cannot tell. That’s very clear if you look outside but there is no way to tell what actually happened when you were sleeping. If you look outside, of course you can see the motion of the other train, but you still cannot tell who is moving. So, the reason we rule that out is we know some extraneous things not connected to the laws of physics. Here is the  axis and here is my frame of reference. That crossing took place at my origin; that’s why my  is zero and took place at your origin, that’s where your ′ is zero and the common time we chose to be zero by convention. Here is something I should explain that I used to forget in the previous years. Let’s say at every point  you have a reporter,  = 1, 2, 3, 4; there are people sitting and watching. So, you guys should think before I write down the answer. It goes without saying that ′ and  are the same. The time difference between two events is the same for all people. So ′ is a function of time and  is a function of time, if you are watching a moving particle. Let’s give the object some speed; it’s moving to the right. Then  – it’s the standard name – is the velocity of the bullet according to ′. So, what I’ve done is, I first took one event and I gave it some coordinates and I told you how to transform the coordinate from one person to the other person. All right, so let’s look at , which is  is equal to some force on the body. Then, I want to convince you that the right-hand sides are also going to be equal. And  over  is minus 1 over  minus–I have forgotten constants like  and  and . I don’t care if it’s 1 over  or ; that’s not important. And we are immersed in this and we are drifting around in space. Well, to find the speed relative to the medium, you calculate the velocity in the medium by Maxwell’s theory. So, it would have been possible to detect the velocity of the train without looking outside, just by doing an experiment with light. So, he postulated that all phenomena, whatever be their nature, will be unaffected by going to a frame at constant velocity relative to the initial one. It was really driven by this notion that all laws of physics should obey the same principle of relativity. If I find some laws, and you’re moving relative to me, you’ll find the same laws. There is complete symmetry between observers in uniform relative motion. And that is a generalization, when we say “all” instead of just mechanical. And the Second Postulate, you call it a postulate because there is just no way to deduce this, is that the velocity of light is independent of the state of motion of the source, of the observer, of everything. For example, gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. Okay, so it looks like he has solved a big problem because he has said why light behaves this way; light behaves this way because it is part of the big conspiracy to hide uniform motion. We are saying, here is a car going at 200 miles an hour, according to me. And that’s not a property of the Newtonian transformation. So, you let the light travel for four seconds and you thought it was only one second. So, even though you restored the relativity principle and brought it back to the front, the price you have to pay is to give up your notions that length is length and time is time. If I have a clock that ticks out one second, you take it on a train, I expect it to be ticking one second, but we’re saying it’s not. Other than the sign of the velocity, each person says the other person is moving and so we will say that any length you give I’ll discount by a factor of . It’s a simple algebraic equation once you’ve got ′ how to solve for ′. Take the second of the two equations and solve for ′. That detail I won’t fill out, but you will get ′ is  over  divided by this. So, the formula really kicks in for velocities comparable to velocity of light. They will be in a more complicated motion, maybe the whole system will be drifting a little to you, but their acceleration will be the same as what I get and the force between them will also be the same as what I get and the laws that you would deduce by looking at that star would be the same laws that I would deduce. We are looking at it from different vantage points. So, to have time as another variable that doesn’t transform at all is not the same as making it into a coordinate."
783,physics,phys-200,lecture-13,"This lecture offers detailed analysis of the Lorentz transformations which relate the coordinates of an event in two frames in relative motion. It is shown how length, time and simultaneity are relative.","We were trying to describe an event as seen by two observers. The fact that space and time coordinates can be combined to give the new space and time coordinates is why it’s called a coordinate. I will say it’s at a distance  from my origin. If I think your meter sticks are short so that I want to blow up the answer with some amount; you are allowed to say the same about me. But the postulates tell us that if my fudge factor is gamma, yours should also be the same gamma. So, I’m going to put it back here, because this is just background from last lecture. You will find ′  divided by the same square root. The rest of the whole remaining lecture, it’s all about getting information from these equations. But I should warn you that it is not an ordinary rotation. Linear transformation means the new numbers are related to the first powers of the old numbers. will be  over c divided by the square root. Okay, so that is the Lorentz transformation. Everything is going to be applying it to understand various things. And according to you, ′, ′. So, write the Lorentz transformation that first relates ′ is  over the square root. Instead of saying the coordinate of an event was  and you get ′′ from the Lorentz transformation, if you take a pair of events and they are separated in space by  and in time by  according to me, the separation according to you, your ′s and ′s are given by similar formulas as the Lorentz transformation; put a  everywhere. Apparently, it’s all right for us to get things wrong. That’s not supposed to happen just because you get into a train. Now, you should have an idea of what I’m planning to do. This is true even for finite differences. My expectation in the old days would be , right? That means my velocity, the bullet velocity, they’re all small compared to the velocity of light; we get back the answer from the old days. Now, let’s find the beauty of this result. Now, the velocity of light is the same for everybody so I can think in terms of what happens. So, let me put a clock at the center of my coordinates system or the origin. It can be 10 seconds, it can 100 seconds. It’s a lot easier here because I get to pump into the equation two facts at one shot, that the time between the two ticks is 1 second and it’s at rest with respect to me, which is why the  vanished between the two ticks. So, anyway, I have this clock that goes up and down. So, it’s as simple as saying that if you had these two clocks, what I think is going up and down and you think it’s a zigzag this way, and I look at your clock, it’s a zigzag the other way, it’s perfectly okay for me to say to you, your light pulse is going on a hypotenuse and mine is going up and down, and why you can say that to me. So, at least this light clock explains to you why clocks will appear to be slow. They should run at the same rate because if they ran at different rates, one slowed down and one didn’t, in comparing the two clocks you can determine your velocity, and that we know is impossible by the postulate that you cannot detect uniform velocity. So, if you have a clock which is just yourself, I look at you, you know, over 15 or 20 years I notice some changes. Do the math, you find the speed, get into the rocket and go and come back. In any other frame of reference in which a clock has any velocity, it will appear to be slower than the advertised time period of that clock. According to the person going with the rod, the two events, since they take place at the two ends of the rod, are separated by the length of the rod because the rod, according to you, is not going anywhere. So, in my point of view, if I made a half a meter hole and your rod has shrunk to half the length, it’s going to fall. Namely, the two ends did not go at the same time. Because in Newtonian days, simultaneity is absolute; length is absolute. If I find the length of your moving meter stick, the two ends at the same time, you will say I didn’t measure them at the same time and the formulas relative will allow that."
784,physics,phys-200,lecture-14,"The four-vector is introduced that unifies space-time coordinates x, y, z and t into a single entity whose components get mixed up under Lorentz transformations. The length of this four-vector, called the space-time interval, is shown to be invariant (the same for all observers). Likewise energy and momentum are unified into the energy-momentum four-vector.","Let me remind you that everything I did so far in class came from analyzing the Lorentz transformations. So, differences are related the same way that coordinates themselves are. Even this one you can think of as a formula for a difference, except one of the coordinates, or the origin. Then, I showed you how when you wanted to measure the length of a stick which is traveling past you, you get your assistants on the–who are all lined up on the  axis to measure the two ends of the rod, or any particular time they like. And somebody goes and assassinates the grandmother. Why this kind of violence is inflicted on grandmothers I don’t know, but it’s a standard example. That is simple algebra; you want this term to beat that term. Let’s understand what this equation means. The only time you will get a sensible value for the second frame, namely with  1 would be if ; that means, here’s the first event and here’s the second event. But this leads to something very interesting. So, whenever you have another event so that , there is enough time for a light signal to go from here to here. I send a signal that goes and makes that happen. It’s only necessary that it could have been caused by this event because not everything in the universe is caused by some other event. So, this is the second thing, and it’s called the light cone for the following reason. They are just dependent on who is looking at them from what orientation. So, it’s reasonable to ask in the relativistic case, where people cannot agree on time coordinate or space coordinate, maybe the square of the time plus the square of the space will be the same for two people. That is a shorthand for  and what you and I used to call the position  of a particle. In other words, the length is perpendicular to the motion, or something you can always agree on. So, the transverse coordinates are not modified. Downstairs, I think we all agree you get  because the square root is squared. This you can do because  individually is equal to . It’s a four-vector; it’s a vector living in space-time. But this funny dot product will be equal to  minus the length of the spatial part, squared.: So, it not only works for coordinates, but for coordinate differences. So previously,  and  were separations between two random, unrelated events or arbitrary events. In the  plane, you draw a line, it’s a trajectory, because at every time, there’s an , and that describes particle motion. Now, this is the new variable I’m going to use to develop the next step. Or you can take derivative with respect to the time as measured by the clock which is moving with the particle. Everybody agrees on that, because we’re not asking how much time elapsed according to you or according to me. And that has the virtue that what you get out of this process will also be a four-vector. By that I mean, its four components will transform when you go to a moving frame just like the four components of . Now, I’m going to define something called the four-momentum. I took the mass and I multiplied it by what’s going to pass for velocity in my new world. But when you look at the momentum, it makes a big difference how much of the one you have subtracted on the bottom. Then, I remind you of the good old formula: 1  1  plusif  is very small. I see the good old kinetic energy, but not quite, because I have this number  here. We can do something more if there’s a way to destroy this. But it did point out that if you can get rid of the mass, because it was energy, some other form of energy must take its place by the law of conservation of energy. So, Einstein is wrongly called the father of the bomb, because this is as far as he went. So, unless the two blocks annihilated and disappeared, then you would really have something interesting. So, I should tell you that I’ve given you guys two more problems, one of which is optional. I’ve given you a lot of terms, and I think even though it’s optional, if you do that problem, you’ve got nothing to fear."
785,physics,phys-200,lecture-15,The discussion of four-vector in relativity continues but this time the focus is on the energy-momentum of a particle. The invariance of the energy-momentum four-vector is due to the fact that rest mass of a particle is invariant under coordinate transformations.,"This is the last and final chapter of this subject, and I think it’s, again–we’re starting by backing off a little bit towards the end of last class. So, I can calculate it, you can calculate it, our  and  will differ, but it’s the property of the Lorentz transformation, that if I square this guy and subtract it from the square of this guy, on the right-hand side some magical things will happen and I’ll get the same combination without the primes. But I know this is a vector because  is a difference in two vectors. Dividing by a scalar, by a scalar I mean something that is not affected by rotations, means taking a vector and multiplying it by some number. Now  is like  or , it’s one of the components, and you don’t divide the change in the vector components by the change in one of the components to get a velocity. It moves the distance  in a time , and we know that for this piece of its motion the following quantity, , which is  , is the same for all people. They differ only by this factor , which is a constant so it doesn’t matter. This factor, by the way, is nothing but usual time dilatation. And the second thing will be  divided by the same thing. Apparently, the relativity theory says this should play the role of momentum, but a four dimensional momentum in your new world. Mass times velocity divided by all this stuff. If that’s the kinetic energy, everything is an energy formula, so the whole thing stands for energy. Well, it looks like  plus ½  plus other stuff, right? In the old days when velocities were very small, we saw only that two terms are written: ½  and . So, now let’s ask what is the invariant length square of the momentum four-vector with itself. That means you are trying to take –I’m sorry, you’re going to take  over this factor square, minus  over this factor square. Well, it’s the square of this guy and case closed; there’s nothing here to subtract from here. Now, I am almost finished with the kinematics except for one thing. Another thing you have to know is that when I write them in this notation as four-vectors, you should know the following: if you know the components,  and  in one frame, and you move relative to  with speed , ′ and ′ will be related to  and  by the Lorentz transformation. Just like ′ and ′ are related to  and  by that formula on the top left. The whole advantage of energy and momentum–What is the big deal about energy and momentum, let me ask you that. Now, if you see the whole collision from your frame of reference, then I maintain that the numbers you get, ′ and ′, will also equal ′ plus ′ plus ′. That’s guaranteed, and I want to tell you why. So, as usual, they will start out with the simplest one and then try to make it more complicated. I don’t know what it is, but my energy in terms of that, the first term,  will be this; this will be .Now, the Law of Conservation of Energy and Momentum, namely , will really be saying all the energy parts of the 0 components will add up before and after, and the first components will add before and after. This is not any different from the old days. Can you think of a strategy that will give me ′ ?: : Your job is to find the unknown mass ′, and the unknown velocity. So, the question you are asked is–No one asked you how fast I am moving after I got hit by the photon; you’re only asking me what is my new rest mass. Because you produce the  rest mass, and you also move the rest mass. And you’ve got to talk about which part of it you find more difficult. And the energy and momentum are assembled into a four-vector, the first component of which is , the second component is just the momentum. You can see the whole thing from a rocket. In that case, my initial momentum will have a spatial part because on the rocket, I’ll be moving backwards. In an atomic bomb, mass is destroyed and energy is created. So, that should tell you that the real energy of the incoming particle has got to be more than just whatever I said, 3. And the momentum of this guy is 0; that’s the initial momentum. In that frame, the collision looks rather different. That I calculate in the center of mass frame, and I get 16. Find the square of this vector, is ( -  = 16. Now, so, let’s see where to write this; maybe I’ll write it here. So, some of the 7 is going to give a momentum to the fragment of the collision, and some is to create them. Not in the lab frame, the center of mass frame."
786,physics,phys-200,lecture-16,"The lecture covers a number of mathematical concepts. The Taylor series is introduced and its properties discussed, supplemented by various examples. Complex numbers are explained in some detail, especially in their polar form. The lecture ends with a discussion of simple harmonic motion.","Ok, so today, it’s again a brand new topic, so if you like relativity you would be in grief and mourning. But I’ll tell it to you, Taylor series, as we guys in the Physics Department tend to use it. And you’ll multiply it by , and that’s your best bet for what the function is, away from  = 0. It’s not even an approximation, it’ll track the function all the way to eternity. If you know 13 derivatives, put 13 derivatives here. Now, it may happen that sometimes you hit the jackpot, and you know all the derivatives. Now, summing an infinite number of numbers is a delicate issue. And you cannot go to the right-hand side of that point. And yet, if you took the Taylor series for it, you will find if you go beyond absolute value at  = 1, the series makes no sense. That’s why we get this famous result we’ve been using all the time. In fact, all of relativity we reduce as follows. This is .If you cut it off after some number of terms, it’s not going to work. In the beginning, 1 minus  looks very good. You add them all together, remarkably, you will reproduce this function. And I hope all of you know enough to know how to find the series. Now, everybody agrees this has got to be one of the most beautiful formulas you can imagine involving numbers or in mathematics. defined from the Egyptian times, is a ratio of circle to diameter. All you will have to know when you manipulate it is that  is minus 1. The example I had here,  is equal to–in this example,  was minus 1 over 2 and  was plus or minus root 3 over 2. component of a vector is whatever multiplies . We denote that as this, and this thing is called the modulus of  . I don’t know if I want to do that; it’s just going to be  times  - . So, this whole thing could be 36, for example. Then, you can see that , which is , is equal to  times  which you can now write as  times e.That’s why we did all that work, to tell you that a complex number can be written in this form. The product  is very easy to calculate in this form because  multiply to give you this, and the exponentials combine. Well, if you doubt me, multiply–cross multiply, and all I’m telling you is that 1 =  times , which you know is true when you combine the angles. So, there is one part of this thing that I want you to carry in your head, because it’s very, very important. So, how many people have seen all of this before? But you will have to go and learn this today. And I’m telling you, there are very few branches of any science where complex numbers will not be used. That’s called unstable equilibrium because if you give that a kick, it’s going to come down and never return to you. That’s because there are restoring forces. If you stray away from the equilibrium, there are forces bringing you back. Well, I did it for you along back, when I gave you a typical paradigm for how you apply Newton’s laws; I gave you this example. So, don’t say what happened there, when you move from one to the other. I think everybody should know that I have to wait at time capital  so that  times  is 2. Or you can say  is 2 over , or you can also write it a 2 times frequency, where frequency is what you and I would call frequency, how many oscillations it does per second. is the amount by which you pulled it when you let it go. If you plot the acceleration, it’ll go from   to minus  .Last thing you want to verify is the Law of Conservation of Energy. If you take, in this problem, ½  +½ –I did that for you–You can also verify this. Even though position and velocity are constantly changing, this combination, if you crank it out, will not depend on time. If you give it a twist, then it’ll go twisting back and forth, like that. So, the equation for the pendulum really is the following:  over  is equal to minus  . What that means is, if you took a real pendulum with a massless rod and a bob at the end, the time it takes to finish an oscillation, in fact, will depend on the amplitude. If there’s something about the class you want to change, you find it’s hard, this, that, you can always write to me."
787,physics,phys-200,lecture-17,"The focus of the lecture is simple harmonic motion. Professor Shankar gives several examples of physical systems, such as a mass M attached to a spring, and explains what happens when such systems are disturbed. Amplitude, frequency and period of simple harmonic motion are also defined in the course of the lecture. Several problems are solved in order to demonstrate various cases of oscillation.","Stable equilibrium, and if you disturb them, they rock back and forth and there are two simple examples. But if you pull it so the mass comes here, you move it from  = 0 to a new location ; then, there is a restoring force , which is -, and that force will be equal to mass times acceleration by Newton’s law, and so you’re trying to solve the equation  times , and we use the symbol, , or  square root of /. And what’s the solution to this equation? You just stick it in and mindlessly calculate all the formulas. In the case of a spring, they would have to give you  or they may tell you indirectly if I pull this spring by 9 inches, I exert a certain force, they’re giving you  and they’re giving you  and you can find . You did this piece of thinking, and namely, you disturbed the system from equilibrium and found the restoring torque. Then, you stared at the formula and say hey, this guy must be the  I’m looking for because that number times  is the restoring torque. Take some irregularly shaped object, a flat planar object. Center of mass is somewhere in the body here. That’s the frequency with which it will oscillate. So, what I’m going to do now is to go over more complicated oscillations using some of the techniques we learned last time. In other words, my claim is that this funny exponential, sum of exponential, is the family of cosine. So, this is another thing you should know. You can also write it as its absolute value. If there are many, you call this  to mean it’s the frequency of vibration of the system left to its own design, and you pull it and let it go. My thinking is going to be: I know a function that repeats itself, even when it differentiated once. Even without doing much mathematical physics, I know if you pull this spring it’s going to go back and forth, whereas these functions are exponentially growing; they’re exponentially falling, they just don’t do the trick. Now, the beauty of the  function now is to take one derivative,  dot. Into that, I’m going to put in the guess,  equals  to the , and what do I find?In fact, let me write the equation in a nicer way:  double dot plus  squared  has to vanish. Take a general problem where you have a linear equation that are two solutions. So, the story is a lot more complicated than it looked. It looked like there are two solutions; actually, there’s infinite number of solutions because you can pick  and  any way you like. It’s non-linear because I’ve got the square of the unknown. In other words,  is not an independent number. This is a problem of a mass , force constant , moving on a surface with friction. So, the equation you want to solve, when you’ve got friction, is really  double dot plus  dot plus  equal to 0. Can you solve this by your usual word problem? The point of writing it this way is to show you that both these powers, this is clearly a positive number so it’s  to the minus a negative number. If I put  = 0, well all this exponential will vanish and I just get , because  to the 0 is 1. This is a linear simultaneous equation for  and . That’s why  and  were related, by complex conjugation. So, let’s take γ over 2 less than , then you will write this as minus  over 2, plus or minus  times  square, minus  over 2 square. They look like  equal to  to the minus  over 2. And if you draw a picture of that, I think you will not be surprised that if you draw the picture it will look like this. Those who want to see that this is true can put that into the equation and check. If you impose that you will find what I told you. Now, this is really difficult because you cannot guess the answer to this by a word problem. The imaginary part of it will be the answer to the fictitious question I posed. over , divided by absolute value of ,  to the ,  to the . Well, now that  got , I know how to find ."
788,physics,phys-200,lecture-18,This lecture continues the topic of harmonic motions. Problems are introduced and solved to explore various aspects of oscillation. The second half of the lecture is an introduction to the nature and behavior of waves. Both longitudinal and transverse waves are defined and explained.,"Okay, so what problem were we trying to solve? So, this is the most general problem we looked at. That’s the problem I spent a considerable amount of time on yesterday. And you find it will work and you can do this in your head. you remember, is the force of friction so we want it to be not only non-zero, but bigger than this amount controlled by the natural frequency. You have a little  here, that this is minus  over two and this is plus something. If you took the square root of that you’ll get exactly  over 2. A cosine function is related to  to the  or  to . If alpha is positive  goes up  Yeah, that’s our main problem. They’re all sitting here, and the friction coefficient, but that’s not enough to tell you what it does on a given day. Now, there’s another thing that could have happened here, which is in fact another alternative. Then, of course, you have the square root of a negative number. This is unforgivable if you don’t know what this is. Too much of friction, you come back slowly and you come to rest. So, let’s write the right-hand side which is not zero as  double dot, plus  dot, plus , equals  over ,  . double dot, plus  times  dot, plus  square , is  over ,  to the . If you took a sine, the middle guy will look like a cosine. So,  double dot will become  square, which is minus  square. And you’re almost there because the time dependence of the two sides are identical, so you can cancel it and what you find is, yes, I can satisfy the equation that’s given to me, provide the number , the number in front of it will obey condition. is obtained by dividing both sides by everything that multiplies , which happens to be  minus  square plus .So, the beautiful property of the exponential function is that you take what is a differential equation and you turn it into an algebraic equation. That’s the property you’re trying to exploit here. And  itself, the complex function I’m looking for is  over ,  to the , divided by this quantity downstairs. I have to be very careful where I don’t square things like here. If  were a very, very tiny number, when , you will be dividing by a very small number and the answer will have a huge rise. Then, you can see when  goes to infinity, very large , you’re diving by  square, it’ll fall off like this. So, you can in fact, by an orgy of trigonometric identities solve it with sines and cosines. over , divided by absolute value  times cosine  minus . If you want a function whose derivative is equal to , then I’m going to say oh, I know the function is minus , and you all know you can add to that a constant. In sound, you know, you light up a firecracker, after a while, you hear it, you can see how long it took and how far you are and you can find the velocity. And all these velocities are all variable. Or in water, the explosions in water, you can hear them faster if you’re under the water than if you’re outside the water because the waves travel faster in water than in air. You don’t know why he’s talking in this particular fashion, but you can at least understand and translate. The actual person in the first place has not gone over physically to the end. I think to do one thing in some depth will give you a feeling for how we analyze waves. I’m going to call it  because it’s been called  in the past. Now, I pull this thing and I want to know what the whole string will do. But all I want you to understand is, there are no new laws that I’m going to invoke. is the angle made by the string from the horizontal, and that angle is simply changing over this tiny length. Mass of this little segment is the mass per unit length, times the length of the segment. What you have to know is that , the displacement of the string at the point labeled  horizontally from the left-hand, at the time , varies with time according to this equation. But it’s going to oscillate, if you imagine a string, take a string or a water wave that is traveling back and forth; the ripples are traveling. Now, if I had more time, I can tell you guys how to deduce the answer. And if I have a time, I should multiply it by something that looks like a frequency. It says, the second derivative of an  should be one over  times the second derivative in time. And that is a very pretty result and I just–I will conclude by telling you what that is telling you. In other words, if  has a certain value,  has a certain value."
789,physics,phys-200,lecture-1,"Professor Shankar introduces the course and answers student questions about the material and the requirements. He gives an overview of Newtonian mechanics and explains its two components: kinematics and dynamics. He then reviews basic concepts in calculus through two key equations: x = x + vt + ½ at and v = v+ 2 a (x-x), tracing the fate of a particle in one dimension along the x-axis.","This is a first part of the year-long course introducing you to all the major ideas in physics, starting from Galileo and Newton right up to the big revolutions of the last century, which was on relativity and quantum mechanics. Some may or may not be useful, but you just don’t know. I will give you some problems to do on Wednesday and I’ll post them on the website. So, I’m telling you from the beginning, but don’t dream and think that somehow the Final’s going to be so much different from your regular day-to-day performance, but to give you some reason to live after the Midterm. I can change everything overnight; it does happen. First, I advise that you should come to the lectures. So I have to take out what I think is the really essential part and cover them in the lecture. If you watch me do the thing on the blackboard, it looks very reasonable. I am now writing a paper with two other people. The final piece of advice, this is very important so please pay attention to this, which is, I ask you not to talk to your neighbors during lecture. Now, this looks like a very innocuous thing, but you will find out, it is the only thing that really gets my back up. That’s because the ideas of physics don’t fall into 75-minute segments and sometimes they spill over a little bit. The only thing that makes it different for me is the questions that you people have. You can stop me any time and you should not feel somehow you are stopping the progress of the class. So, it could be very interesting for all of us to have issues to discuss in class, and quite often some questions are very common and your classmates will be grateful to you that you brought it up. Trigonometry functions you know all the time. A few people I’ve talked to have recommended that we start taking the lab second semester instead of first. Would that be advisable or should we take both concurrently?: But this is a good example of what you need to know. So, what we are going to study now is a non-living object and we’re going to pick it to be a mathematical point. I am hoping that if you learned your calculus, you learned about derivatives and so on by looking at  versus .So, I will remind you, again, this is not a course in calculus. So technically, if you ask what does the velocity stand for–Let me draw a general situation. If a particle goes from here to here,  over , I don’t know how well you can see it in this figure here, is the slope of a straight line connecting these two points, and as the points come closer and closer, the straight line would become tangent to the curve. So the velocity at any part of the curve is tangent to the curve at that point. So you are supposed to know, for example, if , you’re supposed to know  is . A limited class of problems is one in which the acceleration is just a constant. Now, that is not the most general thing, but I’m sure you guys have some idea of why we are interested in that. So, let me think aloud and ask how I will guess in this problem. If I do that, I would like to call the coordinate , then I will write the same thing. Simply knowing the acceleration is not enough to tell you where it was at the initial time. So what I’m saying here is we are specializing to a limited class of motion where the particle has a definite acceleration, . I’m going to find that, then I’ll give you an example. Now, I’m fully aware that this is not the flashiest example in physics, but I’m not worried about that right now. You guys probably know that too from your days at the daycare, but I want to derive the formula and put it up, then we’ll see how to use it. Conversely, if you get an answer and it doesn’t seem to make sense, then you’ve got to go back and ask, am I violating some of the assumptions, and here you will find the assumption that the particle had that acceleration  is true as long it’s freely falling under gravity but not when you hit the ground. If you want to know how fast it’s moving at a given time, if you want to know the velocity, I just take the derivative of this answer, which is 10 - 10. If it’s going up, that’s not the highest point. I would ask you when you follow this thing to do it actively. But some origins are more equal than others because there is some natural landmark there. Another thing you can do is you can find the speed here. I want to derive the last result in another way, then I will stop, and that’s pretty interesting because it tells you the use and abuse of calculus. Then next week we’ll do more complicated problems that involve motion in higher dimensions, how to go to two dimensions or three dimensions."
790,physics,phys-200,lecture-20,"The focus of the lecture is on fluid dynamics and statics. Different properties are discussed, such as density and pressure. The Archimedes’ Principle is introduced and demonstrated through a number of problems. The final topic of the lecture is Bernoulli’s Equation.","In fact, any of you who took any kind of high school physics, you would have done this thing with fluids. The more subtle concept is the one of pressure. You therefore have to push out on the two, on all the walls. That pressure is the atmospheric pressure, plus the extra weight you apply, divided by the area of this piston. So, pressure cannot change at a given depth. The downward force is  [correction: should have said P] times . Because at every height the push from the left and right are equal; I already showed you that. Horizontally, there is no gravity and the pressure at every height is equal. This is , and you can ask yourself the following question. So, now we are going to take this formula  and put it to work. I guess I know what that means, but when I hear the mercury, I think it’s just a waste of time. The next gadget you can build is–you can imagine this–you trying to drink. So, one more example of this , is if I give you another fluid, it doesn’t mix with water and I tell you find the density, there are many ways. If the two heights were equal, then you know we’re talking about the same fluid. But this is supposed to tell you that oil is less dense than water, and we can check that by comparing two points in this fluid at the same height, and saying the pressure must be the same at those points. So, let me write that statement that this pressure and this pressure are equal by saying, atmospheric pressure is on the top for both of them. You want to push down here and raise something there. Because what you really imagine is some elephant. But this is the oldest trick in the book. Now, force multiplied by distance I’m going to write as the pressure times the cross section area, times distance. It applies the same force that it would to its own colleagues. You want to keep the rubber ducky inside the water level, you’ve got to pull it down, or you want to tie it to the–I think one of the problems I gave you–has somebody tied this piece of whatever to the floor. So, you can easily calculate how deep this one should sink to balance its weight. So, you can imagine three cases, one where the density of the material is more than the density of water, in which case it’ll start going down and you will have to hold it up with a cable, but you won’t have to apply the same force as you would outside. So, it’s a lot easier for people to float. Just from that fact, and clever applications of . So, here is the first law that you have to satisfy. What I’m going to do–Look, think about what’s going to happen before you derive any formula. What are the external forces, and what’s the energy is what I’m going to think about. Take this region of fluid trapped between these two cross sections at  = 0. In the end you only ask, who is in contact with me? So, this is really a mass of one cubic meter of the fluid. This is its kinetic energy; that’s its potential energy. So, as you go near the edges, the speed of the fluid will relax to zero. This end has moved here, this end has moved there. So, just focus on the relative increments, and that difference is what gives you the net change in energy, and you equate that to the work done. Now, what if you made a wing that looks like this? Now,  is not the speed of the plane, but we know what  is because  times  is equal to  times . So, you may worry that 1 -  is negative, but so is  because  here is certainly going to be lower than  here. You can also use this to find the rate at which oil is flowing. Suppose oil is flowing in a pipe and you want to know the rate at which oil is flowing. This cannot be oil; this has got to be some other fluid. Well, I don’t–I think all I’m–As far as I can tell, there’s going to be a pressure difference and that’s going to translate into height difference. And if the two do not mix, I don’t know the danger. But it would take years and years to go from there to something practical. Final one, which is the kind of a problem you sometimes do get."
791,physics,phys-200,lecture-21,This is the first of a series of lectures on thermodynamics. The discussion begins with understanding “temperature.” Zeroth’s law is introduced and explained. Concepts such as “absolute zero” and “triple point of water” are defined. Measuring temperature through a number of instruments is addressed as well as the different scales of measurement. The second half of the lecture is devoted to heat and heat transfer. Concepts such as “convection” and “conduction” are explained thoroughly.,"We’re going to have a slightly different schedule for the problem sets. But I’m talking about a cup of coffee that’s been isolated from everything; it maintains the temperature. But generally, you can all tell when it has settled down. Suppose you take a gas and you put it inside this piston here, put some gas inside, you put some weights, and everything is in equilibrium. We go into how tall, how many feet, how many inches, how many millimeters. So, what people do is to pick something a little easier than this rod. Because you may not know that the temperature is changing, because this thermometer by postulate, it’s going to be the temperature by definition. But for a long time, this was a very good start. They found out that if you use a gas–You can define temperature using gasses, which have some very, very nice properties. That it’s also a straight line, has the following implication you guys can prove at your own leisure, which is that, if I think that my gas has climbed 56 percent of the way of this height to the top, so the temperature is 56 degrees, I ask what’s your gas done, you will find yours also climbed 56 percent of the way. In other words, gas thermometers will not only agree at the end points where they must, by construction, they seem to agree all the way in between. That’s why we prefer the gas thermometer. The laws of nature allow you to pick anything you like that varies with temperature and use that as a definition of temperature, as a thermometer. You don’t know what these apes are drinking. On the other hand, you say, “Take any vapor and wait until the product of the pressure and volume go to zero, let’s call that zero,” that’s the universal standard. And everything will follow a straight line, but to define what one degree means, you’ve got to define one other temperature. But this point is called the triple point of water. Now, that is a unique situation; you cannot get to that by any other means. Now, that’s all about heat–I mean, all about temperature. So, heat is denoted by the symbol , and you’ve got to ask yourself, “What are we talking about when we talk about heat?” Say I have a bucket of water; I want to heat it up. They imagined there was a certain fluid which is abundant in hot things, and not so abundant in cold things. When you put hot and cold together, this magical fluid flows from hot to cold, and in the process heats the cold thing. And so, you have to define what a calorie is. But this is true for any substance, whether you’re heating copper or wood or gold; no matter what you’re heating, it is true the heat need is proportional to mass and to the  temperature. It’s not, because the first one could have been a mile long, second one could have been a foot long. If you are worried about that, you know, take a huge container so that the volume of water dominates the surface area of the container. Then, I put the pellets into the water, and there will be a period when the temperature is not defined. In any of these heat problems, I urge you to draw the following picture. This is way back when people did not even know about atoms. So, the temperature of the universe goes through huge ranges, and only when you probe different ranges you see different physics. I’m saying it gets stuck at zero, but your calories are getting you something; they’re converting ice into water. In a solid, everybody has its place; you can shake around where you are, but liquid you can run around. You’ve got to first spend a few calories going from here to here, you got some more money left you can start melting this, maybe you’ll run out of stuff there, and that’s what you will have. Well, the answer will depend on how much of the stuff you have. Then, you can solve for the final temperature. That’s the heat it takes to melt the ice. Then, all those losses of the original water is equal to the gain of this ice. That will be a good assumption if I say I sprinkled two drops of water on a big iceberg; we know it’s going to end up as ice and that’s a good starting point. If you guys want me to tell you some more I will, or I can move on. Do you understand what you have to do in each problem?Okay. So, that’s really electromagnetic radiation that comes from hot, glowing objects, and directly comes to you. There are lots of laws for radiation; I don’t want to give them to you because there are formulas you memorize, and you don’t understand too much of the physics right now. So, you can imagine a rod of some cross-section , one end of the rod is in some reservoir at some temperature , other end is at temperature . You have a little container in which there is a paddle. So, what we will find is what I’m going to show you next time, is that if you kept track of the kinetic energy of every single molecule in this car, every single molecule in that car, before and after, and you added them up, you would get exactly the same number. On top of it, it’s got random motion of the molecules that make up the car."
792,physics,phys-200,lecture-22,"This lecture continues the topic of thermodynamics, exploring in greater detail what heat is, and how it is generated and measured. The Boltzmann Constant is introduced. The microscopic meaning of temperature is explained. The First Law of Thermodynamics is presented.",": So, I had to leave you in the middle of something pretty exciting, so I’ll come back and take it from there. There is really nothing to the left of this  = 0.The next thing I mentioned was, people used to think of the theory of heat as a new theory. So, in the old days, we would say, well, we don’t apply the Law of Conservation of Energy because this was an inelastic relationship. That’s true, because if the amount of gas is zero, we think there’s no pressure. Mass would be a reasonable argument, right? I don’t know what you want me to call this constant, say, ′. This constant contains everything, but I pulled out the mass and the remaining constant I want to call ′. This is actually correct. If you do it that way, the constant ′ depends on the gas you are considering. The number you will put in there is some number like 10 or 10. For example, when you want to buy eggs, you measure in dozens. When you want to buy paper, you might want to measure it in thousands or five hundreds or whatever unit they sell them in. When you want to find intergalactic distances, you may use a light year. You use units so that in that unit, the quantity of interest to us is some number that you can count in your hands. If you’re thinking of a gas and how many moles of gas do I have? We want to ask ourselves, “Is there a microscopic basis for this equation?” The pressure is the force on this face divided by area. Now, I have  molecules or  atoms, randomly moving inside the box. In reality, of course, you must admit the fact they move in all directions, but the simplified derivation happens to give all the right physics, so I’m going to use that. So, that’s why the force will appear to be steady rather than a sharp noise. So, as far as any one set of faces is concerned, in one plane, only the motion orthogonal to that is going to contribute. That’s why you have  over 3.We’re almost done. Remember, this is not true if  is measured in centigrade. Now, this is the picture I want you to bear in mind when you say temperature. Absolute temperature is a measure of molecular agitation. So at certain degrees, like 300 Kelvin, hydrogen kinetic energy would be the same, carbon kinetic energy would also be the same. So, at every temperature there is a certain shape. For a gas it means a distribution of velocities. In the last few years, what people did was the following. You want to look at gross macroscopic properties and there are two that you need. So, different parts of the gas at different pressure, we don’t call that equilibrium. So, you want to find a device by which you can stay on the  diagram as you change the state of the gas, and that brings us to the notion of what you call a quasi-static process. Are all of these small processes reversible?: For a thermodynamic system, you cannot move them too fast, because they are extended and you are having a huge gas a single number called pressure, so you cannot change one part of the gas without waiting for all of them to communicate and readjust and achieve a global value for the new pressure and you can move gradually. So, try to remember that for what I do later. It expresses the Law of Conservation of Energy. In the end, all you want is you want the molecules to move faster than before. So, this is a graph  times  equal to constant, because  = . coordinate vanishes,  will go to infinity. Go back to equation number whatever I wrote down. If you’ve got a solid and you use , that is correct, because when you heat the solid, the heat you put in goes into heating up the solid. So, when you study specific heat, which is my next topic, you’ve got to be a little more careful when you talk about specific heats of gases, and I will tell you why. Now, specific heat, you always say is  over  or  divided by the mass of the substance. Because every molecule gets a certain amount of energy, namely 3/2 , and you just want to count the number of molecules, or the number of moles. But for a gas, when you heat it, the volume changes so much that the work it does against the external world is non-negligible. Because you were letting the pressure be controlled from the outside at some fixed value. That’s why the specific heat per mole is the right thing to think about because then the answer does not depend on what particular gas you took. It’s called , that’s five-third for a monoatomic gas. You can just take the ratio of the numbers."
793,physics,phys-200,lecture-23,Why does a dropped egg that spatters on the floor not rise back to your hands even though no laws prohibit it? The answer to such irreversibility resides the Second Law of Thermodynamics which explained in this and the next lecture. The Carnot heat engine is discussed in detail to show how there is an upper limit to the efficiency of heat engines and how the concept of entropy arises from macroscopic considerations.,"What I did yesterday, or Monday, was to describe to you the First Law of thermodynamics. Reversible means that you can also go right back to where you came. Then the heat will flow from the hotplate to the gas. There you don’t see anything happening, right? That invisible flow people used to think of as the caloric fluid, but now we know it’s just molecular kinetic energy transferred from the molecules in the plate to molecules in the gas. This is  and , and I want to find the work done by the gas during this expansion. So, the work done, the sum of all the infinitesimal works, is the pressure as a function of volume times  from the starting volume for the ending volume. Now, I’m using the factor at every point  is , so  is  over , and this is a logarithm and we all know how to do the integral, as log of the upper limit minus log of the lower limit. You can take the gas on any path you like, you know. You take this gas, you keep it on a reservoir at temperature  [ is just ]. On the other hand, another person can do the same experiment of the gas but put a pin here so the piston cannot move. The other one is , which is  over  at constant pressure. So, let me derive one more time these two specific heats because it’s worth going over this again and again. As long as it’s a monoatomic gas, it doesn’t matter what the mono atom is. If it is at constant pressure, you’re letting the piston move up and some of the heat is being paid to move the piston, only the rest is going to change the internal energy. So, even though the work done is said to be the area, you’ve got to keep track of sign. If you’re compressing the gas,  is negative. So, you can see that in this full cycle, when I go from  to  to  back to , the work done is the area enclosed by the loop in the  plane. So, the same loop, as a geometrical figure, as the same area, but the work done by the gas is positive in this case and negative in this case, and you can use common sense to find out if it’s positive or negative. You look at a gas and you cannot say this is the heat in the gas. So, the processes I’ve considered so far are isothermal, at constant pressure is called isobaric, and I don’t know the name for constant volume, but no work is done at constant volume. You wrap this guy in a blanket and you do things to it. So, an adiabatic process will cross from one isotherm to the next to the next to the next, changing temperature. Now, this is another thing you people should understand. You’ll find everywhere an  will come and cancel out. So, this is the relation between the temperature and the volume. You take  over  to the power of : Exactly. Because  to the minus , is equal to  to the minus  plus 1 over minus  plus 1. So, this is the work done in an adiabatic process. So, you guys should be able to be given various graphs on the  plane, find the work done in going from here to there, find the change in internal energy, find the heat added and so on. So, you watch the movie being played back and what do you find? It was not a piece of wood and it didn’t stop. Here’s another thing that does not happen. Hot and cold, when mixed, will never separate back into hot and cold. The engine also rejects some amount of heat  to a lower temperature .The lower temperature, if you look at a steam engine–if you’ve gone–Have you guys seen a steam engine? Obviously, such a path exists because of the way isothermals and adiabatics are in the  plane. In one cycle, the gas has some heat coming in. heat rejected , some work done, , and it comes back to where it is and you can go on doing it many, many times. The derivation of the result you should’ve seen at least once in your life. So, I’ll come back and I’ll tell you next time why no engine can beat this engine and why hidden in this result is the notion of entropy."
794,physics,phys-200,lecture-24,The focus of the lecture is the concept of entropy. Specific examples are given to calculate the entropy change for a number of different processes. Boltzmann’s microscopic formula for entropy is introduced and used to explain irreversibility.,"Okay, what I did last time was describe to you a certain heat engine called the Carnot engine. There are two things you have to notice about the Carnot engine. You’re never far from equilibrium and if you can go one way you can go the other way. Now, if you say you have a better engine, you have a better efficiency. for–no,  for your engine, okay; your engine is better than Carnot’s engine, okay that’s your claim. If you take a Carnot engine and do the following things, run it backwards and make it twice as big. I’m just saying I want it to be twice as big for the following simple reason. Therefore, you cannot have an engine more efficient that the Carnot engine. If it produced 30, I’ll get an engine which is one-half times as bigger than the standard engine; run it backwards, your 30 will feed my engine and you will find once again heat is flowing from a cold body to hot body with no other changes anywhere in the universe, that is forbidden by the postulate. If I had more time I could show you that all reversible engines operating between two temperatures will have the same efficiency, namely that of the Carnot engine. And what Carnot is telling you is the best efficiency any engine can have is this. But the point is you cannot say the  here is so and so. But now I’m going to tell you so listen very carefully. In a tiny little process, if you are at some temperature , you add a little amount of , keep track of all the changes, and that change will be zero, as I showed you in this Carnot cycle. That means every point can be associated with a number you can call entropy. Now, you have no idea what this quantity stands for; you agree it’s bizarre. We can see it is true; at least in the Carnot cycle you can verify in detail that the change in the total of all the s over  is in fact zero. At all stages I want the system to be almost near equilibrium. In the sense of calculus you can make the difference as small as you like provided you do enough number of times and slowly I raise this guy from here to here. When you divide by , something you don’t understand, but anyway, let’s make sure we know how to calculate the increase in entropy when water or something is heated from a lower to higher temperature. Again, the system must always be in equilibrium or near equilibrium so I can plot it as a point in the  diagram, so I slowly take grain after grain, do the whole thing I told you, and find , this is 2 and this is 1. Because on an isothermal  is zero, I repeated it many times but you’ve got to know this,  is . See, this is a confusing problem because  happens to be . Why do you need this new concept called entropy? Or if you let a gas trapped in half a room, escape to the whole room, it’ll never untrap and go back to half the room. Flowing from cold to hot, entropy goes down, not allowed. The minute you remove the wall, pressure is something here, pressure is zero in the vacuum. Because the internal energy cannot change because  = 0, work done is zero. So, what do you mean by  over , there is no . In fact, it was discovered long before atoms were proven to exist. Then put  here and  here,  here and  there; that’s one arrangement. You are demanding that all the  molecules on their own, there’s no partition now, on their own be on the left-hand side. So, if you want them all to be left, there’s only one way to do that, and that’s like saying I tossed a million coins, I wanted all heads. Already when one is on the left and  - 1 on the right, there are more ways in which that can happen. Therefore, if you go back to the Boltzmann formula and, wait let me keep the formula here, and look at  then you find  is when everybody is on the left, that is  1, and  is 50/50 mix, half on the left and half on the right, that entropy is  2,. The question is if you remove the partition, what would they likely do? So, what you find is entropy is the direct measure of how disordered your system is. Okay, so that’s called the arrow of time. If you took care of all of that, entropy of the universe will go up or remain same; it really doesn’t go down."
795,physics,phys-200,lecture-2,"In this lecture, Professor Shankar discusses motion in more than one dimension. Vectors are introduced and discussed in multiple dimensions. Vector magnitude and direction are also explained. Null vectors, minus vectors, unit and velocity vectors are discussed along with their properties. Finally, several specific problems are solved to demonstrate how vectors can be added, and problems of projectile motion are expounded.","Everything I told you last time, you can summarize in these two equations. This is a matter of simple algebra, of taking this and putting it here. I got the feeling, when I was talking to some of you guys, that maybe you should brush up on your calculus. You can go to Amazon or you can go to our bookstore. There’s only one occasion where it helps to go to three dimensions because there are certain things you can do in 3D you cannot do in less than 3D. But that’s later, so we don’t have to worry about that. If this is , I’m going to draw a vector here. I expect that if I add  to , I should get the guy who plays the role of 0 in this world, which is the vector of no length. So  and  are vectors of length one, pointing along  and . This part, being parallel to , has to be some multiple of . Therefore, the vector  that you gave me, I have managed to write as ( times ) + ( times ).You can ask yourself, “If you gave me a particular vector, what do I use for  and ?” If you give me a pair of numbers,  and , that’s as good as giving me this arrow, because I can find the length of the arrow by Pythagoras’ theorem. And I can find the orientation of the arrow by saying the angle  that satisfies tan () is  over . But you can also do something without drawing any pictures. If you say, “Add the vectors,” I would just add the  to the  and the  to the  and I’m keeping track of what the sum is. A very important result is that if two vectors are equal, if  = , the only way it can happen is if separately  is equal to  and  is equal to . If it’s not obvious, I think this is the kind of thing you should fill in the blanks when you go home. This vector has a little bit of negative  in it. What you will get for  will be  cos  -  sin . But this is the same vector we are calling ( times ) + ( times ). I’m going over these points, because they’re very, very important. That, we recognize to be  plus everything else, which is  times  +  times y. I’m going to call this guy a tiny vector .In other words, when you move on a line, you wait a small time . You start with a vector, you change by this vector . Dividing by  is like multiplying by 1 over . Just take the derivatives and that’s the velocity vector. So that a half circle, instead of calling it 180 degrees, we will call it just . This cosine is going to become a minus sine and give me another . It tells you when a particle moves in a circle, it has an acceleration in a negative  direction, namely directed towards the center. By the way, one thing I should mention to you. At any instant, your motion, if it follows any curve, locally can be approximated as being part of some circle. over  is the acceleration directed towards the center of that circle. But if I see you through the glass, the object is going on some trajectory, which has got both up and down and horizontal motion. But this is the way to do it in two dimensions. There is somebody in a car and decided to fly off. I don’t think I have to actually do that step. It says you are on the ground on two occasions. This says, if you want to be in the air for a long time, maximize sin , so you may think that 90 degrees is the best angle. Just go back as often as possible to this formula and work your way from there. I want you to find the speed so it will land here. You can deduce it because the carriage is moving the other way."
796,physics,phys-200,lecture-3,This lecture introduces Newton’s Laws of Motion. The First Law on inertia states that every object will remain in a state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. The Second Law () relates the cause (the force ) to the acceleration. Several different forces are discussed in the context of this law. The lecture ends with the Third Law which states that action and reaction are equal and opposite.,"Let me start again by reminding you what it is that was done last time. What I did last time was to show you how to handle motion in more than one dimension. By the way, I would like to make one recommendation. Somehow, when I told you to invert the transformation, some of you had some difficulty. Frequencies, how many times you go around, and 2 is the rate at which the angle is being changed. In other words, it will become - times itself. That means the acceleration is pointing towards the center of the circle and it has a magnitude . I have shown you yesterday that the speed of the particle as it goes around the circle is this ().Again, you should make sure you know how to derive this. This is the acceleration directed toward the center. I’ve got to tell you that I realized fairly late in life they are more subtle than I imagined the first time. But Galileo already managed to find examples where things would roll on for a very, very long time. Nowadays, if you go to outer space, you can check for yourself that if you throw something out, it just goes on forever without your intervention. Because if I think it’s not moving, you think it’s not moving. But things which were at rest will move at a constant velocity, opposite of the velocity that you have relative to me. The point is that there are inertial frames of reference. If you invented it, we’d call it whatever your name is, but this is the guy who invented it, so it’s called a Newton, usually denoted by a capital N. A typical problem that you may have done in your first pass at Newton’s law, someone tells you a force of 36 Newtons is acting on a mass of whatever, 4 kilograms; what’s the acceleration? If they’re equal, maybe you will say the law is working. Then, that ratio will give you acceleration. Remember, when we hang the elephant in outer space, nothing is going to happen.: We want to know what is the mass of the elephant. You hook one end of the spring to a wall and you pull it from rest by some amount and you attach the one kilogram mass to it. Does outer space even rob you of something to which you can anchor a spring? Then, all springs will do something like this. So  is not really the coordinate of the end point. Namely, if you pull it by so much, that’s the force it will exert. Therefore, when you divide by the mass to get the acceleration, the response of different bodies is inverse to the mass. So, Newton did not ever tell you what the expression for force is in a given context. Suddenly, you have a mathematically complete problem. Then the acceleration of the planet is the force of gravity between the planet and the Sun, which Newton will tell you is directed towards the Sun and it depends on how far you are. and they tell you the answer, which will be some elliptical motion. He probably felt that nobody around was doing any work, because all the thing was given to this one person. This is the thing about action and reaction. I think you people know how we can say that with confidence. Here I got 3 kg and I got 2 kg and I’m pushing with 10 Newtons and I want to know what happens. Maybe you should complete the force acting on this one. That’s, in turn, because this guy’s being pushed by the 10 Newtons, but that’s not your problem. For this guy,  will be 10 minus  is 3 times . Well, if it was greater  It won’t snap, but something else will be a problem. I’m going to give the last class a problem which is pretty interesting, which is what happens to you when you have an elevator. We’re going to ask, “What’s the needle showing at different times?” So springs are always pushed or pulled on either side with the same force. You cannot have a spring pulled only at one side, because then it will then accelerate with infinite acceleration in that direction. The way I analyze it is, I say, if I look at me and I write the forces on me, that is  acting down, then we use  as the symbol to represent the force exerted by the spring;  -  = . As you start on the top and go down, your acceleration is negative. You can see that if  was equal to , your downward acceleration is that of gravity, namely the cable has snapped in the elevator, then you don’t feel any weight."
797,physics,phys-200,lecture-4,"The lecture begins with the application of Newton’s three laws, with the warning that they are not valid for objects that move at speeds comparable to the speed of light or objects that are incredibly small and of the atomic scale. Friction and static friction are discussed. The dreaded inclined plane is dealt with head on. Finally, Professor Shankar explains the motion of objects using Newton’s laws in specific problems related to objects in circular motion, such as roller coasters and a planet orbiting the Sun.","I was just saying that I am beginning to recognize some of you people. The first thing you have to know in order to use the laws of Newton, you have to separately know the left-hand side. You have to know what force is going to act on a body. If I start off the mass in a position where the spring is neither expanded nor contracted, that’s what we like to call  = 0. So, one thing is, you can go to the Math Department and say, “Hey look, I got this equation, what’s the solution?” Or you might say, well, let me fix that by making it minus ; then it quickly comes to rest after a time and doesn’t move. I could have pulled it by 2 or 3 or 9 meters. But I want a value of 5, I put a 5 in front. That just means–Who do you want to blame for this equation? It turns out, even if there is no friction this is not the correct law of physics. This does not satisfy the relativistic dynamics; by that I mean, if you really pull a real mass by 5 meters or whatever and release it, its motion will not be exactly what I said; or it’ll be off by a very, very, very tiny amount that you probably will not discover in most laboratories. So, it’s a law that has a limited domain of validity. So that’s how you slowly study and identify new forces. But again, we’re going to start with easy one. If that’s all you had, the block would fall through the table; it’s not doing that, so the table we know is exerting a force. You say this vector is normal with that vector, you mean they are perpendicular, and here we mean this force is perpendicular to the table. As you all seem to be aware, there is generally a force of friction between this mass , and this table. But you are around, you can do what you want. Just apply force to it and push it on the table and it’ll stop eventually, and that’s how you think there must be a force, that’s out there. Static friction is not a fixed force; it’s whatever it takes to keep it from moving. And that maximum turns out to be a number called the coefficient of static friction times the normal force. Can you think of something else it could depend on but doesn’t? It doesn’t depend on the area of contact. So, this is how you characterize friction. But if you couldn’t do this, you have no right to complain because this is the entry ticket into the business. Even though the Earth is not touching this block, the Earth is somewhere down here, it’s able to reach out and pull this block down. This is a good way to measure , by the way, because if you drop something, it falls too fast for you to time it. You will know it’s wrong because this is an acceleration and that’s an acceleration. And that’s because  cancelled out of the two sides of that equation. So, now we are going to make it a little more complicated. Let me crank up  and see where it’ll start slipping. In other words, there is a coefficient of static friction between the block and the plane, and I want to know, like parking a car in San Francisco, what angle can it take before it starts sliding down. Well, at the maximum angle friction is doing the maximum thing it can do; then, we can certainly say  is then equal to the static friction times , which is now  times . Do you agree that I’m not doing anything beyond Newton’s laws when I do this? There is force of gravity, the normal force, everything else is a fixed direction; you can draw it once and for all. This is accelerating downhill, at some angle; that’s accelerating uphill. The second thing to notice is: can I use this formula when  is bigger than ? You are not finished because, oh don’t clap here, I got a homework problem, by popular demand. I apply , that’s it; and I’m going to get everything by applying , to this guy. The tension on the rope can only be along the rope. It can only pull it along each direction. Again, if these two have an angle , that is the same angle  there, and there is the mass of the car this way. If you want the car to go around the bend, at a certain speed, 40 miles per hour or so many kilometers per hour, and the road itself is part of a circle of radius ; it doesn’t have to be a full circle. You can make that for forced radials today."
798,physics,phys-200,lecture-5,"The lecture begins with a review of the loop-the-loop problem. Professor Shankar then reviews basic terminology in relation to work, kinetic energy and potential energy. He then goes on to define the Work-Energy Theorem. Finally, the Law of Conservation of Energy is discussed and demonstrated with specific examples.","I was going to do a brand new topic but I didn’t want to go without making sure everyone understands the loop-the-loop problem. Here is something which is downward acceleration, but it’s not falling down. So, it is accelerating, and the difference between this one accelerating, let us say–If I go to the loop-the-loop and I drop an apple, forget the track it’s got  acting, it’s accelerating too. And the tiny increment in velocity if added this way will produce a velocity in that direction, and what that really means if you wait a small amount of time, this thing is going along the new velocity direction. If you have a huge velocity to which you add a tiny change in velocity, the downward direction you rotate the velocity vector that just means that as it goes around the circle, the velocity vector is constantly tangent to the circle. Okay, today there is a very, very important concept I want to introduce. You might think they have a trajectory but they don’t. Okay, if you haven’t seen it that’s fine, this is not something you’re supposed to know. You just have to know what we have done so far. When a force acts on a body, what is its main effect? That’s what we learned long back, this is just kinematics. So, it seems to depend on how far the force acted, and the change is not simply in velocity but in velocity squared. The force of a spring is one concrete example; it’s what you all seem to recognize; it’s this one [()].So then, we have to ask what is the Work Energy Theorem when the forces itself vary? That’s the area and that’s the change in kinetic energy. This is the area I’m looking for, and I write it as  from zero to the point . But the point  is whatever point you want. There are integrals for all kinds of functions, and you check them by taking derivatives and make sure you get back your .Alright, suppose this is what we learned from the math guys, then go back to the Work Energy Theorem and see what it says, .Oh, by the way, I didn’t complete one story; let me finish that. I’m sorry, , it’ll be the same as .Now, we don’t like the form in which this is written. Conservation of Energy in physics has a totally different meaning from conservation of energy in daily life. And it’s very useful to know that does not change with time, because if you knew the value of , even if  were to equal some fixed number  at one time you know  at all of the times. Yeah, for a spring I think we said here, if the force is , the potential energy is /2,  will be /2. Right, there are two forces acting on it. When you do the integral in calculus, integral of  is , but  and  are minuses of each other. So, integral of force will give  initially  finally. If you knew the total of these three numbers at one instant, you know the value at any other instant. Okay, now, we are going to find one bad boy, bad girl, bad person, which is going to ruin this whole thing. So, I try as usual, to get a Law of Conservation of Energy when friction is acting, and you will see that I will not succeed. I integrate the force from start to finish and I call that the difference of potential energies; then I’ve got my result. I was just going to say the energy of the force of friction is no longer within the system  No, but you’re all telling me why there is a loss of mechanical energy but I’m just a mathematician. For this part of the journey from here to here, during that part of the journey, the force is a well-defined function. I can even ask, – this is one of the homework problems, I think – you’re asked, “How far does it go to the left?” In this particular problem, if you told me you are doing this part of the journey, during that part of the journey because for the entire trip, the velocity had a particular sign, namely to the left, force of friction had a definite magnitude and sign, namely to the right, and then of course it’s as good as any legitimate function and you can do the integral. Let me just take one good force and the force of friction. During each segment the force should have a definite direction and magnitude so you can do the integral. That change in  is a derivative of the function at the point  times the change in . And that’s giving you this part but there’s a tiny portion on the top, which is  that you’re not getting. Why don’t you go home and work out the series for  at all points? You have got to remember that  has a beauty, that the derivative is  itself. And in particular, what is  itself,  itself  to the 1;  is  to the 1 so put  = 1 you get 1 + 1 + 1 over 2 factorial plus 1 over 3 factorial. But for now, these ideas will be useful for what we’re doing next time."
799,physics,phys-200,lecture-6,The discussion on the Law of Conservation of Energy continues but is applied in higher dimensions. The notion of a function with two variables is reviewed. Conservative forces are explained and students are taught how to recognize and manufacture them.,"If you’ve got a function , you know the value at some point, and you want to go to a neighboring point, a distance  away. So, I have to make sure that you guys know enough about functions of more than one variable. So, this is, again, a crash course on reminding you of the main points. So, imagine something measured out but I’m sitting here. So, it turns out, and you will see it proven amply as we go along, that you just have to think about derivatives on two principle directions which I will choose to be  and .So, we’re going to define one derivative, which is defined as follows. So, you can also move from here to here, up and down, and see how the function changes. So, one tells you how the function changes, with  I should move along , and the other tells you how it changes at  as you move along .Let’s get some practice. So, when I say , the rule is find out how it varies with  keeping  constant. But now, we have an interesting possibility you didn’t have in one dimension, which is to take the  derivative of the  derivative, so I want to take  by  of . So, I want the  derivative of the  derivative. It had a different value of  in the same  and then I went horizontally when I keep track of the changes.” Draw a box around that, because that’s going to be–This is just the naïve generalization to two dimensions of what you know in one dimension. So, the first question is, “What should I use for the work done?” I want that to be the same entity, so I will choose it to be that, but  has got now  , because you know whenever you take a vector , then its length is the square root of the  part squared plus the  part squared. So, this is what I will define to be the power. Then, it has the advantage that the work done is in fact the change in kinetic energy. I want to define work so that its effect on kinetic energy is the same as in 1D, namely, work done should be equal to change in kinetic energy. The  component of  times the  component of , plus the  component of , times the  component of . At each point, the force could have whatever value it likes. You should follow from–Is it an independent definition or is it a consequence of this? An important property of the dot product, which you can check either way, is the dot product of  with , is dot product of  with  plus dot product of  with . When two vectors are perpendicular the dot product equals 0. Oh that’s interesting, I didn’t think about it. Everything will get a′. But the combination, , when you evaluate it before or after, will give the same answer because it’s not so obvious when you write it this way. You will get the kinetic energy at the end minus kinetic energy at the beginning. You all have to understand, before you copy anything down, where we are going with this. So, I’ve shown you that if we took a random force, the work done is dependent on the path. The force is always parallel to the path along which you have  No, but see the point is you’ve got to first write down a force in the  plane. In fact, the claim now is this force is going to be a conservative force. But if you also kept track of how many feet you climbed and you added them all up, what answer will you get? Now, you knew this already when you’re moving up and down the  direction but what I’m telling you is this is true in two dimensions. So, you draw a line at that height and call it the total energy. You can have a roller coaster whose energy is like this. There’s one thing I want you to think about before you go. Okay, one challenge you guys can go home and do this, take any force in two dimensions, ; it is parallel to the direction where you are measured from the origin times any function of the distance from the origin. Show, convince yourself that this force is a conservative force by applying the test I gave you and the trick is to use  and  instead of . This is the force to which you should try your thing and gravity is a special example of this."
800,physics,phys-200,lecture-8,"The dynamics of a many-body system is examined. Through a variety of examples, the professor demonstrates how to locate the center of mass and how to evaluate it for a number of objects. Finally, the Law of Conservation of Momentum is introduced and discussed. The lecture ends with problems of collision in one dimension focusing on the totally elastic and totally inelastic cases.","So, today we are going to do something different from what’s happened so far, in that we are going to study the dynamics of more than one body. But actually, the Sun was not doing anything interesting in our analysis. That’s , and that’s equal to force on body 1, .Now, look at the body one and ask, “What are the forces acting on it?” On the left-hand side, I have  times  double dot, so I have really  times  double dot. So, they’re just floating around, affecting each other’s dynamics, and of course this person will feel a force due to that person, that person will feel a force due to this person, but what I’m telling you is the center of mass is going to drop like a rock. You take a complicated object; it’s got masses and it’s got springs; it’s connected with thread, and chains and everything. It’s not going to work for arbitrary bodies. If I give you some crazy object like this, you cannot do anything. I’m trying to draw the mirror image of this object the other way. Yes, can you tell me where the center of mass should be, yeah? Okay, so the correct answer is, replace this mass by all of its mass, whatever it is, sitting here. Then I’m pretty much done with finding these centers of mass. The object I’m going to pick is a triangle that looks like this; it’s supposed to be symmetric, even though I’ve drawn it this way. So, I get  times  over 3.Now, you know there is one more thing we have to do. You combine symmetry arguments with actual calculation. If you take a single particle of mass , and velocity , we use the symbol , maybe I’ve never used it before in the course, and that’s called the momentum. So, if I’ve not introduced to you the notion of momentum, well, here it is. So, if you think about it that way, this looks like the momentum of the center of mass, and we are told the momentum of the center of mass does not change if there are no external forces. So, momenta of individual objects have changed. You will say the body will maintain the velocity. If it was at rest, since the external force is 0, it will remain at rest. So, let me give an example of where the idea comes into play. The momentum of the Sun doesn’t change, but it changes in the momentum of the Earth. But when you equate that to the force of gravity, the  over , for that  it is the actual distance from the Earth to the Sun that you should keep, because the force of gravity is a function of the distance between the planets, not between the planet and the center of mass. It has an acceleration towards the center, and somebody’s providing that force. And as they tell us to do, we won’t draw the horse, we’ll just say it’s a point mass , and the railway carriage is a big mass, capital , and let’s say the left hand of the railway carriage is here. So, the  coordinate of that and that’ll be somewhere in here. You can use any origin you want for center of mass, it’s not going and it’s not going according to anybody, but it’s convenient to pick the shore as your origin, find the weighted sum of your location and your mass, the boat’s location and boat’s mass. The boat will keep moving because there’s no force on the boat; it’s going to keep moving. The boat, no reason to change, and keeps going. The rocket is a little more subtle and I just want to mention a few aspects of it. If you are riding with the rocket and you look at the fumes coming out of the back, they will be leaving you at that speed . usually stands for the change of something, so that’s not what I mean. This one you ignore because it’s the product of two infinitesimals, one is the amount of gas in the small time , the other is infinitesimal change in velocity; we keep things which are linear in this. So, if you remember that, you’ll write this . If you cannot follow my handwriting or you’re running out of time, just what you should be understanding now is that there are formulae for the final velocity when the collision is totally elastic, or totally inelastic. In the old days, this is the trick people had. I cannot draw one more picture, so you guys imagine now. Because, what’ll happen is, some energy will go into heating up the block; it might even catch fire if the bullet’s going too fast. From that, you can find the velocity  with which this composite thing, block and bullet, will start moving."
801,physics,phys-200,lecture-9,"Part I of Rotations. The lecture begins with examining rotation of rigid bodies in two dimensions. The concepts of “rotation” and “translation” are explained. The use of radians is introduced. Angular velocity, angular momentum, angular acceleration, torque and inertia are also discussed. Finally, the Parallel Axis Theorem is expounded.","Okay, so this is a new topic called Physics or Dynamics of Rigid Bodies. It’s not enough to say the football is here. The football could be here but its long pointy end could be up to down or side to side. We want to focus on a body which is only rotating but not translating. Well, any motion it does will be such that that point is not moving. So, if I give you , I think you’ll have to think about it and you have to agree I have told you where the body is. So, we’re going around in a circle, and I’m asking you how big is that segment, that arc length  that it has traveled, when it’s rotated by an angle . It may be connected to how many fingers we have. You’ll find, over and over, people using units which are natural to us. If at an instant, this piece of the sample just broke and flew off, it’ll keep flying with that speed. This  is an analogous thing to ordinary velocity but it’s also an actual velocity here, the good old velocity, that’s the tangential velocity of points which are part of a rotating rigid body. But I’m saying it can also have a tangential acceleration, if on top of everything else, the angular speed itself is changing. So, you will cling onto it with that force, and that force will be applied in turn by the third law by the disk on you. Well, you need the force to provide you with , and I’m telling you that your  has two parts. This thing which is spinning can only spin clockwise or counter-clockwise. It is rotating with a common angular velocity. But the  doesn’t have a subscript ; there’s nothing called  for this one and  for that one. So, the moment of inertia is determined not only by the masses that make up the body but how far they are from the center. So, the moment of inertia depends on the arrangement of the masses. The moment of inertia–If someone says, “Here are the masses, here’s where they are, please find me the moment of inertia,” you will say, “I cannot do it.” It’s also worth knowing that if the body’s being rotated about mass , then  doesn’t contribute to the moment of inertia; it’s out. So, this is going to be the analog of mass in our world of rotations. So, now we are looking for the most important equation in mechanics, which is . So, let me tell you one way to get to the law. If you only look at forces you’ve got to be careful. So, this  is that really if you want the change in , and that’s proportional to  times the change in angle. Also, if you want, in terms of work done, you want the force times the distance traveled. So, the distance traveled is  dot product with the direction in which you move, and that applies only to the force perpendicular to the separation, not to the part that’s parallel. Then I’m saying, I think we all know, we want to start pushing here. And in my work energy argument that’s what comes here. This rod is massless; the force on this is . Because the rod is a rigid body, it won’t let the mass move in this direction. Let’s find the work done by that torque when I rotate it from the starting angle to some final angle. The work I did has to be changing the total energy of the body, but the bob was not moving before, and it’s not moving after, because I give just the right force to cancel gravity; I didn’t give it any speed. So, this is the simplest problem you could do in rigid body dynamics. So you will have to do an integral here also. It is a ring and I want to find its moment of inertia. Well, for the mass I should use, I argue that if the total mass is that   is the mass per unit area. Adding it up is what we do by doing the integral. But we know some of the mass is a lot closer to the center. If an integral is an even function of , namely,  contributes as much as , then you can take half the reason of integration and double the answer. So, when I keep going, it will get even smaller. Now, the thing to check if you do this, the moment of inertia around one end is the moment of inertia around the center less the mass times (/2)."
802,physics,phys-201,lecture-10,Ampere’s Law is used to find the magnetic field generated by currents in highly symmetric geometries like the infinitely long wire and the solenoid. It is shown how magnetism can be used to convert macroscopic mechanical energy to do microscopic electrical work. Lenz’s and Faraday’s Laws are introduced. The latter says that a changing magnetic field generates a non-conservative electric field.,"I told you about Ampere’s law, which is key to what we are going to do next, so I’ll remind you what the deal is. Now there’s another subtlety I didn’t get into last time, which is the following: remember, this is the current penetrating a surface, bounded by this loop. There are many, many surfaces that have the same loop as the boundary, right? So one example I did, I want to repeat it, because one thing I said wasn’t right. So for whatever reason, this is out and this is in. And the answer can only depend on how far you are from the wire. I definitely don’t want to repeat that, which is, what if the wire is thick. Now one loop we know produces a field that goes like this. Here you have a  going one way and you have the same  but the path is going the opposite way. Because there’s no current coming out, this line integral has vanished, therefore  times that length and  times that length going the opposite way must be equal in magnitude. See, in a finite solenoid, you sort of know the lines will do this, right? The two sides, this and that, do not contribute because they are perpendicular to the field. These two better make cancelling contributions. Only thing I don’t know is, how big is it? Well, you’ve got to figure out again with the right hand rule, the way I’ve shown the currents, if you do this around the wire, the flux is actually going like that here. If you take a doughnut with a wire wrapped around it and you cut it, it’s going to look like this. Because this loop cuts through every turn of wire. As far as the direction is concerned, it will go like this. or  — I forgot what I called it — that is 0. That’s why we care about  and , because they make things happen. When do we keep on modifying the equations? That’s the only reason you modify your results. Now I’m going to ask you what happens, because this is something you must know. One of them is, you put the light bulb because it’s going to glow. The force is the magnetic force that we wrote. In other words, if you resolve this  x  into two parts, the vertical force is due to the horizontal velocity, and the power is that times the vertical velocity . It doesn’t do any work, but you need it here, because one component of the magnetic field does work. I’m going to give you another equivalent way to explain the balance of energy. Someone’s carrying the magnet and running with it.” But that’s not acceptable, because if you believe in the reality of the field, what it does at a given point depends on its value. This is an electric field of brand new origin. You can deduce them only from experiment. And the only way to get that is to say when there’s a changing magnetic field, I have an electric field, and furthermore, electric field which is no longer conservative because its line integral is not 0.So we’ve got to find out what it is. Then the current will start going this way to prop up the thing back to its old value. Not the whole length, but the length of the loop that is still inside the magnetic field. Now the only thing is with the - sign, let’s figure out if the sign is correct. Therefore the current should flow in such a way as to continue the flux. So in other words, I’ve given you something that I say is a new law. But I can think of the second surface as essentially the old surface + the sides. So you agree that , where delta is the stuff you glue on the side to the old surface to make up the new surface. So I’m going to say the change in Φ = times ,  on the old surface, + here is the stuff we have to do that’s extra. Then I get  = /⋅ on the surface, + the line integral of  x . Now you should know enough about cross products to know that this cross product is the same as  x , because you can rotate the factors in an  x  is x , is x ."
803,physics,phys-201,lecture-11,The electric effect of a changing magnetic field is described using Faraday’s Law. The direction of the current so generated is given by Lenz’s Law. The operation and energy accounting of the generator are described. The concept of inductance is introduced. The Betatron is described as an example of Faraday’s Law. Self and mutual inductance are introduced. The energy density in a magnetic field is derived.,"All right, I’m going to begin by summarizing stuff done near the end. First of all, if you ask, “Why does this thing change? And we cleverly chose the surface to be the one containing the original surface and the two walls, and the circular walls, if you like, that add onto it and produce a new surface. The physical loop was moving and there is an emf driving charges around the loop. One had to do with the motion of the loop. So it is true even if you remove that loop. The - sign tells you, if you want to know when you drag a loop or when you change the flux through it, what is it going to do, the - sign tells you it’s going to fight the change in flux. Then you had a loop which we were dragging to the right. And that means the current will flow that way. I also explained to you that the energy balance is that the work done on the wire, on the light bulb, is paid for by the person pulling this loop, because the minute you have a current, that current doesn’t like to be dragged across a field. Let’s see if that has the right line integral of  that we want. The only time you’ll get a non-zero line integral for Faraday’s law, is if you take a loop that’s partly in that region and partly in this region. And there is a  somewhere, maybe like that. But when you do the emf, you don’t have to worry about this part of the velocity along the wire. It’s really present as a force, but not as an emf. It bends in a magnetic field which is going in the plane into the blackboard. And the remarkable thing that was noticed is if you write the equation , which is the force you need to bend into a circle, that’s going to be . So I’m going to write now the equation I get. Now if that’s the electric field you multiply both sides by , which is the charge of the object, that’s the force. So we’re going to keep the particle at a fixed radius. And the radial force to keep it in orbit at the tangential momentum also increases, and the demand when you look at it says that the field at the periphery, where it’s rotating, must be ½ the average field. Momentum was , the force to the center is . Therefore it will try to produce a current that looks like this. I know which way the current will flow if I let it flow. So the bottom line is that if you have open circuit, and if you put a volt meter that measures voltage, you will get exactly that time dependent voltage. You take a battery in your hand, you don’t run a current, you don’t pay anything. But the minute the current flows through the loop, you will not be able to pull it to the right without paying the force. The question is, what will happen if I look at the two ends of this wire? Therefore if you don’t open the black box, you don’t know what’s inside, if you just took the two wires coming out of it, the static field coming from this will be able to do work going from + to - terminal. So now you can see here that the flux in the second coil is due to the current in the first coil and the coefficient of proportionality is called the mutual inductance. And the flux of the magnetic field is  times the cross sectional area of the coil. You see that?So the first coil has some wrapping density of wires,  turns per unit length. You count how many penetrate the second one, multiplied by the number of turns, if they exist in the second one, divide by the current producing it. So inductance is measured in henries, another thing for you. You cannot do it for DC, at least, not in any simple way. So this is a huge object, a tiny object, you can balance them. That’s why you need to know that proportionality. The flux of the magnetic field is μ  times the area of cross section. From that we learn that when you have a magnetic field, there’s an energy of /2μ per volume. This is the circuit we’re going to look at. If you want, they are connected to energy."
804,physics,phys-201,lecture-12,"Like capacitors, inductors act as energy storage devices in circuits. The relationship between voltage, inductance and current in a variety of circuits with DC voltages is described.","Okay, I left you guys thinking about inductors last time, so I should start there. So let’s start with a simple problem where I have a voltage source. So when you have this thing, as I told you, solving differential equations is a matter of guess work. You rely on what you’ve seen before and you guess the answer. So quite often, one may be on top of the right answer, but one may not know how to solve it, so one doesn’t even know if the theory is right. There is no function whose derivative we cannot take. But anyway, this guy we can trample to death as follows. So we are saying, get me a function whose time derivative looks like the function itself up to a constant, and that’s something we know from high school, is an exponential function. You can see 9 times satisfies the same equation. Whenever we have an exponential, it will always be e to the minus a physical quantity divided by some number that sets the scale for the physical quantity. Tau is a unit of time whose numerical value is and we can write I as . In the beginning, it may look like — I’m sorry, in my example, in the beginning, there’s an electric field here, nothing in the capacitor. After a quarter cycle, there’s nothing here, there’s a magnetic field in the inductor. So this is called the frequency, which is 1/√. That’s the analog of square root of  over . That means  obeys this same differential equation. With those two pieces of information, I can solve for  and .This I think you should know, this kind of stuff you should know, so I won’t say too much about that. We put an alternating voltage on these guys. It looks a lot like Ohm’s law, because the current looks like voltage divided by some number, but that’s a very big difference. The voltage is a cosine and the current is a sine. It’s the same profile as the voltage, except you divide by . That means when one guy is at maximum, other is at minimum. That’s why sometimes I’m not paying attention to some constants. Once you guess the answer, you put it in and you analyze the solution, you notice also that the current and the voltage are not in step. Then we know that we can write a complex number as  and visualize it in a complex plane where you measure  this way and  is measured that way. That’s the Cartesian version of the number and the polar number of the number. That’s going to be very important for what I’m saying. Because  is the integral up to time t of the current, that’s just  It’s the same equation, but now, unlike in this problem, where I had no driving voltage, I have a driving voltage, and I’ve also written it in terms of current rather than in terms of charge. But when you leave it alone, then also you get a cosine  You cannot do that, because sine will become a cosine and sine will become a sine. So star is the rule by which if had a real and imaginary part, you flip the imaginary part. So that solution for  of  implies a second equation. But its real part will be due to the real part of your voltage. You will find you will get times +  times + 1times I˜ times e is Ve. I want you to know that in the bottom is like -in the top. And this is called the impedance , it’s a complex number. The physical current is a real part of this, without the twiddle, that we write as real part of  Where do I get the real part? So I want you to think about the magic of complex numbers. There is no way you can divide the voltage by anything to get that current."
805,physics,phys-201,lecture-13,"The mathematics underlying LCR circuit theory for AC currents is discussed. Complex numbers are used to convert differential equations to algebraic equations. The notion of impedance is introduced. The radio is used to illustrate the concepts of resonance and variable capacitance. The body of classical electromagnetism treated so far is reviewed and summarized. The displacement current is introduced, leading to the complete Maxwell equations.","I thought I would go back a little bit to LCR circuits. That frequency is the same as this frequency. Everybody with me on that part?That determines the condition, that determines the current at every instant in time. So  is the answer to the problem where the driving voltage is not real, but this, if you mathematically write the same equation. You cannot borrow from the real part and give to the imaginary part. So if you want to, if you say, “I don’t want to deal with complex numbers” you can take a guess like this and put it in the equation, and after a lot of manipulation, you will find there is a satisfying this condition. There’s nothing you can do to a cosine which will shift its phase. So you can imagine doing any realistic problem. So you can imagine now putting numbers and getting what you want. So I’ve written it for one possible sign. Now there’s another station with a different frequency. Can you go and buy one radio for this station, one radio for that station? Whatever the voltage is, you take that, shift the phase by  and divide by mod . This current doesn’t vanish, but you should add to this, this function. You can fit the actual experiment to the solution by choosing A and B to match the initial current and say the initial charge in the capacitor. You cannot guess anything cosine and anything sine. But I will show you that if you use complex numbers, you can reduce the problem to something that looks like a DC circuit. So it is still true, even in this complicated problem, that once you’ve solved it, you may take the real part of the voltage and take the real part of the current anywhere, that’s the answer to the primordial problem. In other words, let me just write it below this here. The only subtlety is, the impedances are complex, and the rule for impedance is very simple. Is there any physical significance to the imaginary part of the solution? The  inside the box could be a complex number. You add on to get this guy and take the real part. In the initial problem, if you were just trying to find the total current through the system, impedances add, like — That’s what I said. His question was, what if I’d like to know the current coming out of this guy? I cannot say it anymore because I don’t know another way to say it. Sometimes the generalized problem is easier than the original one. Sin cos, if you put a 2 and divide by 2, is proportional to sin2. There’s a reason why for a trigonometric function, it’s got a number which is 1 over root 2 times the amplitude, but I don’t want to go into that, because we don’t use it again. The main thing to know is that, if you want, you can redefine a new quantity, /√2 and /√2, so that these factors of 2 disappear, and things look like the good old days of resistive circuits. So very often when they say this is a 110 volt power supply, they really mean the RMS value 110 volts. But what you wanted is the analog of this one. This is an example of something that is quadratic in the interesting quantities. There were masses rolling down and things colliding. Now it turns out this is not still the end. We don’t know where it begins or ends; we don’t care. That’s like a lightning strike inside the little world. You see in the region between the plates, I have no current, I agree. If you took a surface like the first one I took, that slices through the wire here, there’s no electric field anywhere, inside a perfect conductor or anything, there’s going to be no electric field. If I go to the region between the plates, there is no  there, but there’s the rate of change of electric flux. No ρ, no charge density, no current density."
806,physics,phys-201,lecture-14,"Waves on a string are reviewed and the general solution to the wave equation is described. Maxwell’s equations in their final form are written down and then considered in free space, away from charges and currents. It is shown how to verify that a given set of fields obeys Maxwell’s equations by considering them on infinitesimal cubes and loops. A simple form of the solutions is assumed and the parameters therein fitted using Maxwell’s equations. The wave equation follows, along with the wave speed equal to that of light (3 x 10^8), suggesting (correctly) that light is an electromagnetic wave. The vector relationship between the electric field, the magnetic field and the direction of wave propagation is described.","Before we start today’s lecture, I just wanted to explain to you that at the end of the class, I have to run out and catch a plane. This one, without that, used to say electric field is a conservative field. Now I’m going to eventually focus on free space. Now let’s measure  as the distance from the left end and  as the height at that time . So you resolve that force into a vertical part, up and this one has the vertical part down. So you have a net force because this angle or the tangent to the string is changing with position. If you do that, and sin and tan being equal, I can write it as tan - tan. from calculus, you remember, is the slope. The speed of waves is determined by the tension and the mass per unit length. Now let me rush through this and do it one more time. This is what I want you to know about the wave equation. Bring that surface over and glue them with that face common to both. Then I claim that the surface integral on this one + the surface integral on that one is the surface integral on the union of the two. Think for a minute about why that is true. If you compare them, piece by piece, this face matches that face. What we will do then is not to take arbitrary surfaces, but infinitesimal surfaces and we’ll prove for them that the Maxwell equations are satisfied for the solution that I come up with. But we live in three dimensions so that we may have a loop like this, floating in three dimensions. In general, it can vary with everything, but I’m trying as a modest goal to find a simple solution which has a dependence on only two of the four possible coordinates. In general, these functions will be functions of  and . In other words, the field lines are parallel to this face, so they are not going to penetrate it. So if you get 0, either because the field is parallel to the face, or if it’s perpendicular, it has the same value on opposite faces, with opposite pointing normals, or opposite pointing area vectors and you get 0. That’s how you get the surface integral of  to be 0 on this tiny cube. In other words, this is a tiny loop of size  — let’s see. If  is pointing up, it cancels between these two. These two have no contribution, because  is perpendicular to . I’ve chosen it so that with the right hand rule, the area vector is perpendicular and coming out the x axis. But we are going to keep things to first order in and , so it doesn’t matter. Therefore the line integral of the electric field is proportional to the derivative of  with respect to  times the area of the loop. The surface integral being proportional to the area of the loop is obvious, because it’s the surface integral. The last one, another loop equation, I’m going to go through somewhat quickly, because it’s going to be 0 = 0. You will get it for every component of  and every component of . But I’m not interested in the most general case, because this is enough to show you where everything comes from. So it is self sustaining and it’s an oscillation if you like, but it’s an oscillation over all of space, and not over 1 or 2 degrees of freedom. Now I’m making a very special function of y and t. Till now, I just said it’s a function of y and t. All I needed was it’s a function of y and t.That was enough to get me all this. That means better equal  — I bet I dropped a  somewhere. One guy, the electric field, is always living in this plane. So this is in that plane and that is in the vertical plane. Then when you’re warmed up, do the others."
807,physics,phys-201,lecture-15,"The physical meaning of the components of the wave equation and their applications are discussed. The power carried by the wave is derived. The fact that, unlike Newton’s laws, Maxwell’s equations are already consistent with relativity is discussed. The existence of magnetism is deduced from a thought experiment using relativity.","Okay, this is the final lecture on electromagnetism. Then it’ll take a turn for the worse when we do quantum mechanics, but I think the mathematics of that should be quite simple. Then you will find the magnetic field should be electric field divided by . At zero,  is 0, at λ,  should be 2Π. When you go a distance lambda it should be equal to a 2Π change. again, is a function of space at a given time if you draw it, but the  vector’s pointing this way, so it’ll look like this, and you can keep repeating this. This whole graph describes the situation at one given time only at points on the -axis. Then you can ask yourself what happens later. This shows you the periodicity in space of  and in time of capital . Okay, so this is another way to write it, and  will be the same thing. So imagine the plane wave is coming from the blackboard towards you. Now polarization is the direction of the electric field in the solution, but we’ve got to realize that not every electric field has to look like this. I can make a new problem where I have solution looking like this. If you want them to go the other way you’ve got to reverse the direction of  so it points that way. If you look at a wave this way it should still obey Maxwell equations, right? All right, so let me tell you now about the energy contained in this wave. Now you may ask me, you found the energy density in a capacitor, now we’re talking about the electric field in vacuum traveling from some radio station, how do I know this formula is good?And the remarkable thing about the field is that any expression you derive for it is a local expression. From the definition of the velocity of light and μ and ε this is simply ε over 2. The intensity is equal to the energy density times . I’m not going to worry about the half, but if you took this to be the average intensity you can ask, “How big is the electric field that comes with it,” because that light is going to be this electric and magnetic field. Well, you can say in the atom the electron changes energy level, but before you do the quantum mechanics. So what happens in a radio station is you could imagine a simple radio station with an LC circuit, the current is oscillating at some rate, and part of the circuit is in the antenna, and the charges are going up and down as the current goes back and forth that sends out the waves, and the waves come to your house. And so far I never mentioned the word relativity, so you can ask yourself, “How are these modified by Einstein’s work?” So there are at least some inertial observers. These are some of the results we got from electromagnetic theory. So this equation is to be used in its present form only by a person for whom the string is at rest. Because everything needs a medium to travel they said there is an ether. Then, of course, this is to be used only by people who live in that ether at rest, but we are moving relative to the ether because we are on the earth which is going around the sun. It will look the same for anybody moving relative to me at any speed. It was that it was already consist with the relativity. is the speed of an object according to me. First result is if you’ve got a wire and it’s got  is the number of carriers, charge carriers per unit volume, and  is the cross section of the wire, and  is the charge of the carrier, and  is the velocity of the carrier, then the current is equal to , sorry, . This is the neutrality condition for the wire. Our prediction is that it will just stay there because it’s neutral and all we know is electrostatics. It’s still supposed to go in a straight line because the wire is neutral. But now I say I’m allowed to view the physics from any frame of reference I want. So in general, if you want to analyze the problem carefully, you can have this wire moving at one speed and this charge moving at a different speed, but I want to do the easier case where they’re both the same. If you go to the frame moving with the particle the plus wire comes to rest, so the density of the plus charges will just become , the rest density of the plus charge, but the minus charges now they will be boosted by this factor because they’re going the opposite way, and it doesn’t matter which way they’re moving. This guy is the current,  is the current. But the leading order in  you can see this."
808,physics,phys-201,lecture-16,"Geometric optics is discussed as an approximation to wave theory when the wavelength is very small compared to other lengths in the problem (such as the size of openings). Many results of geometric optics involving reflection, refraction (mirrors and lenses) are derived in a unified way using Fermat’s Principle of Least Time.","Well actually, a brand old topic, because it’s about light, but I’m going to go backwards in time, because just before the break, we had this finish with a flourish, Maxwell’s theory of light. I can pick units in which the wavelength is million or 1 millionth. So you illuminate a region which is the same shape as what you had here. Now I can tell you what I mean by, the wavelength is small or large. It’s like saying, if you have understood Einstein’s relativistic kinematics, if you go to small velocities — again, one must say, “Small compared to what?” Then you will have to realize that drawing straight lines won’t do it. So sound waves can get around an obstacle, but not light waves. If he and his friend, instead of being on two different mountains, are in the same room, and they do the experiment and they get the same delay, then they know that it’s nothing to do with the travel time. So the idea of finding the velocity of light, the first correct way, came from Roemer, I think in 1676.He did the following very clever experiment: here’s the sun, let’s say, and here is the earth and here is Jupiter. And the moon goes round and round Jupiter, and we know from Newtonian physics that it will go in an orbit with a certain time period. Let’s say you wait until it’s hidden behind Jupiter, or it comes right in front of Jupiter. So this delay is clearly due to the motion. But it was quite an achievement, take a number that could have been infinity and to nail it to within 50 percent accuracy. Second thing they will teach you is that if light travels from one medium to another medium, say this is air and say this is glass, then the first thing to note is that the velocity of light, , is the velocity in vacuum. That was done and that was measured and all that stuff. This parallel ray of light, you can sort of imagine, will go off like that. And if forms a reduced image of the object. That’s the dinosaur, and there’s the I mean, the image of that, and it says, “Objects may be bigger than what they appear in the mirror.” Instead of really focusing, it anti-focuses, so the focal point, if you want, is on the wrong side of the mirror. So that tells you first, light travels in straight lines when there’s no other obstacle. One person may say, “Look, he told me to touch the wall, so I’m going to get that out of my way first. So let’s call that point where you hit as . This is at some height , this is at some height . You should calculate the gradient and go along the gradient. That’s what we’re going to talk about now. But it turns out, you can aim anywhere you like. You will thank me when you use that rule. But you are supposed to follow the Principle of Least Time. It comes here, and having come here, if it has to take the same time as the other beam, it’s the time to go there. A parabola is a curve which is equidistant from a point and from a line. So let’s ask ourselves the following question: if I take a sphere of radius R and I slice a part of it, okay, it’s a hollow sphere and I slice a part of it and I paint it with silver, so I’ve got a mirror, this part of it, what will be the focal length of that?That’s what we are asking. Whenever you deal with a mirror or a lens, things like are all going to be treated as big numbers. As you straighten it out more and more, it will just reflect it and go right back. You draw a perpendicular from the circumference, you hit the center, but that’s looking like the plane mirror for that particular light ray. You want that angle to be equal to that angle. So let’s take this height h here, and you can notice that tan  =  and tan  = . And people sometimes define a magnification  to be −. What they mean by the - sign is that if this comes out negative, the object is in the upside down version. Thereby you can show that this ray, which hits the center of the mirror, will also come to where this one came. So I’m not going to do the calculation, but I want you to think about what it is you want to calculate."
809,physics,phys-201,lecture-17,Ray diagrams are used to investigate the behavior of light incident on mirrors and lenses. The principle of least time is used to show that all rays from an object in front of a concave mirror focus on the image point if they are not too far from the axis. The experiments describing the breakdown of geometric optics are discussed.,"All right, I’m hoping that this interlude into optics will give you a chance to catch up and be on top of the class, okay? Well, this guy hits that wall, I mean, this mirror here. So this ray does that, loops around and comes back here. How much time does it have?Well, it has the time to go here, plus the time to go an equal distance f on the other side. Then the next question is, it’s not enough to have — then I told you that if you want, you can approximate this by a spherical mirror. In that region, it coincides with the parabola. Here’s another ray that’s a little interesting. The one that hits the center here, that’s , very obvious incidence = reflection, because the mirror is vertical here. But if you really want to nail this down, you want to be able to prove that no matter what height you pick for the interception of the mirror here, you will take the same time. The time it takes to travel for any  should be the same. That’s the one that goes here, hits the center of that and comes here. A sphere will not focus a parallel beam even if the beam is too wide. But if it’s very short, short compared to  and and so on, it will do a good job. Can you see in that figure in the right that the right angle triangle — maybe I’ll bring it down one more time to show you. This is the point and this is the point . So the right hand side is very easy to calculate. So let me open out everything in the bracket here. You may think that because it’s under square root, when you take the root of it, it may become x. Is that your worry? In that sum, these numbers are going to be big compared to this one, whether you take the square root  or not. Yes, so I’ve done this a lot of times, but I want you to follow this, because this is telling you how to organize the calculation. So what is -2, is − over  divided by 2 - 2  squared v by 2 divided by 2 = 0. So you can ask, what’s the point of doing this exercise?This tells you that because of the Principle of Least Time, the time it takes to go not only for these two privileged rays, but any ray you can think of drawing from here to the mirror and back here. You will see why I bother to prove that in a minute. That path = square root of  + square root of . Even here, there are higher powers of  that I’m not keeping. But this is a calculation of the focal length. I’m assuming you have used them a lot in your younger days. But of course, you can also take an object, even closer to the mirror than the distance . So the first ray I can draw is the parallel ray going through that. In other words, a parallel ray, going like this will end up at the focal point, therefore this is to guide the eye. If you want to know what happens with one particular ray, join it to the focal point, hit the mirror and come out horizontal. And after a few days, those guys were just fine. The eye cannot focus anything that is closer than a certain distance called the near point. That’s why you need a magnifying lens, and that’s the last thing I’m going to tell you, is the principle of the magnifying lens. And for small angles, we forget the tan and we say  is /25. Therefore typically, you pick  to be infinity that means you put the thing you’re looking at right at the focal point. Now you might say, “Look, I’ve never seen an object at infinity. So you take this little thing you’re looking at, and you use the lens to create an image at infinity, and again, forgetting the extra 1, most people don’t bother with the extra 1."
810,physics,phys-201,lecture-18,"Young’s double slit experiment shows clearly that light is a wave. (In order to observe the wave behavior of light, the slit size and separation should be comparable or smaller than the wavelength of light.) Interference is described using real and complex numbers (in anticipation of quantum mechanics). Grating and crystal diffraction are analyzed.","I dropped a bombshell end of last class telling you that all the geometric optics I taught you has to be revised, and before letting you go for lunch I said you’ve got to tell me why I would do that. One thing we demand of every new theory, yes? You open two windows you get the light equal to the sum of the two. Suppose it oscillates like this, and this could be 10,000 oscillations per centimeter, and your eye is able to look at it only one millimeter at a time, then you’re averaging over a region and you only find the average of this graph. For example, ψ can be the height of this string that’s vibrating. This is for people who have done somewhat more advanced mathematics. Box of ψwill vanish and the box of ψwill vanish. Well, if the constant is negative 1.Very good. Therefore, in the electric field the brightness is not measured by the electric field, the one that oscillates, but by something quadratic in the field, and that’s called the intensity. It is the measure of energy contained in the wave or brightness. That, you see, has got a ψ and a ψ + 2ψψwhich is + something which is indefinite in sign. For the real function the simple squared and the absolute value squared are both the same. Usually you get interference when two people are sending you a signal. And the height of the water will actually be simply the sum of the two heights. Anyway, they are the two extreme cases where you can check your formula. At this instant its real part is just this one,  cosine . The real part of it has got a maximum of  here, a 0 there, and -, and that’ll be the cosine, because the horizontal part of this is  cosine . And as it rotates if you follow the shadow on the -axis you get the real part, which is our function. You can take it before or you can take it after. It’s not going to give you anything new, but it’s helpful to think of our actual ψ+ ψ, if you like, is the real part, which is the projection on the x-axis, but it’s a lot easier to add these arrows than to add the real parts. This is when I’m not going to draw any pictures. So let’s write it as a common  times 1 + . I hate doing that, but once in a while we have to do that. And double the height means four times the intensity because intensity is proportional to square of the amplitude. When you go a half a wavelength in a wave you’re doing exactly the opposite of what you’re doing here. A little later the first one says go down, second one says go up then also nothing happens. That’s because if you’ve got two signals coming from here to here only if you go in this direction will you get the maximum phase, the maximum path difference if you go straight up, and if that’s not enough to be some multiple of λ there’s no use going any further because theta you can get is 90 degrees, and the biggest path length you can get is then the space between the slits d, and your multiple wavelength should fit into that. So even if you go a centimeter away you will find that your probes, like your eyeball, if your eyeball is this big, okay? That’s why we think there is no interference because you only pick the average value. But think of another direction which is not the forward direction. All the colors will come to the forward direction and you will get a big bright area here, but look at what happens to the different colors. That’s because λ depends on the color; d is, of course, the spacing between these little lines on the grating, so sine θ is a function of λ. When you see it from this side it’ll be glowing. In the forward direction everybody’s in step, but if you go off at some angle they’re not in step because you can see this guy is behind that guy, and that guy’s behind by that amount. So when the whole phase shift is λ, or the path difference is λ, you can pair the points into two at a time each differing by λ/2 and we know they will separately cancel. That’s why I said earlier that if you want to see the effect of wave optics you need to have the length in the problem, which is the size of the hole, and the wavelength in the problem comparable to each other. They were not able to produce slits which are this narrow. Most slits you produce by drilling a hole with your electric drill will be many, many times the wavelength of light. This is an extra length traveled by this guy. It’s λ/. If this is the wavelength here the wavelength in a medium of refractive and  is λ/. If this whole thing is equal to a full wavelength, this round trip, I claim you’ll get a dark spot. The only thing to do, when you do your homework, if you didn’t read the section don’t forget there’s an extra factor of Π in the phase shift when you hit the hard medium."
811,physics,phys-201,lecture-19,"The double slit experiment, which implies the end of Newtonian Mechanics, is described. The de Broglie relation between wavelength and momentum is deduced from experiment for photons and electrons. The photoelectric effect and Compton scattering, which provided experimental support for Einstein’s photon theory of light, are reviewed. The wave function is introduced along with the probability interpretation. The uncertainty principle is shown to arise from the fact that the particle’s location is determined by a wave and that waves diffract when passing a narrow opening.","So this is a very exciting day for me, because today, we’re going to start quantum mechanics and that’s all we’ll do till the end of the term. I want you to think about this as a real adventure. When the dust settles down, a certain picture emerges and that’s the picture I wanted to give you. The best way not to worry about your old theories is to not do any experiments. It all starts with a double slit experiment. You can ask, “How can it be that I open two windows, room gets darker? In a real life thing, if this were really windows and this was the back wall of your house, the oscillations would be so tightly spaced, I’ll just draw some of them, that the human eye cannot detect these oscillations. The average value will in fact look like .So this is all very nice. You come back the next day, you look at the film. Normally you will have bright and dark and bright and dark patterns on the back wall if you turn on a powerful light. Everything that you think of as continuous is made up of little molecules and in a bigger scale, much bigger than the atomic or molecular size, it looks like it’s continuous. In other words, for particles, which have definite trajectories, opening a second slit should not affect the number going through the first slit. So the role of the wave is to determine the probability that the photon will arrive at some point on the screen. It is a particle in the sense that the entire energy is carried in these localized places, unlike a wave. So where is the photon when it goes from start to finish? Let me just plot it if you like,  times the . And what you find is that below some minimum value, no electrons come out. Now the kinetic energy is the energy you gave to the electron minus . Now you may have thought of one scenario in which all of these tiny little kids can get something lifted out of the well. If it bounces right back, that cos  is -1. They’ve got some plot, and that’s my average chance. It means if you did a double slit experiment, and you sent electrons of momentum , one at a time, and you sit here with an electron detector, or you have an array of electron detectors, he claims that the pattern will look like this, where this pattern is obtained by using a certain wavelength that corresponds to the momentum of the incoming beam of electrons. Okay, so this is the peculiarity of particles now. And why is it with electrons — if instead of the big scenario, we scale the whole thing down to atomic dimensions, and you’re talking about electrons and slits which are a few micrometers away, why is it that with electrons, you can do that? The answer has to do with this wavelength . Then you will find a pattern that looks like this. If I want to locate the electron with some waves, with some light, I want the momentum of the light to be weak, because I don’t want to slam the electron too hard in the act of finding it. Once you change the momentum, you change the interference pattern. The problem is that when it bounces off the electron and comes back to you, it would have changed, the momentum by an amount that you cannot predict, and I’ll tell you why that is the case. Remember that part from wave theory of light. So if you think of this light entering your microscope, it spreads out. I can make my filter finer and finer and finer, till I’m able to give the electrons a perfectly well defined position and perfectly well defined momentum, namely 0.That’s true in Newtonian mechanics, but it’s not true in the quantum theory, because as you know, this incoming beam of electrons is associated with a wave, the wave is going to fan out when it comes out. That’s why I did that diffraction for you. The uncertainty in  position is just the width of the slit. With every electron now — so let’s summarize what we have learned. Then you want to predict the future, so you want to know the coordinate and momentum of a future time. In Newtonian mechanics; I’m not talking about quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, you are given a function . That means the probability for finding it cannot be dependent on position. I try to pay attention to that and I will repeat it every time, maybe adding a little extra stuff. It looks like electrons and photons are all particles and waves, except it’s more natural to think of light in terms of waves with the wavelength and frequency. And when does the wavelength come into play?Whenever you do an experiment in which that wavelength is comparable to the geometric dimensions, like a double slit experiment at a single slit diffraction, it’s the wave that decides where the electron will go. A particle can only look at one slit at a time. If you’re trying to squeeze the wave this way, it blows up in the other direction."
812,physics,phys-201,lecture-1,"The course begins with a discussion of electricity. The concept of charge is introduced, and the properties of electrical forces are compared with those of other familiar forces, such as gravitation. Coulomb’s Law, along with the principle of superposition, allows for the calculation of electrostatic forces from a given charge distribution.","So, I’ve got to start by telling you the syllabus for this term — not the detailed one, just the big game plan. The only thing anybody knows right away is  stands for acceleration, and we all know how to measure it. In principle you can find the mass of everything. If it’s connected to a spring, and you pull the spring and it exerts a force, someone’s got to make this measurement to find out what the force will be. And that is how you compare the electric force with the gravitational force. Then you take a piece of hard rubber and you rub that on something else. So I’ll give a different shape to that thing. Last thing I want to mention is if you took two of these things which are repelling each other, let’s say. If you connect them with a piece of wire and take away the wire, they no longer attract each other. Now, if you look at this number here, 1 over 4, its value is 9 times 10 to the 9. The second part of , which is not necessary for any of these older phenomena, is that  is quantized. You can produce strange particles in an accelerator. And they can be manufactured in a collision in another part of the universe. In the case of the rubber stick, it gains the electrons and whatever animal you rubbed it on, it loses the electrons. So actually real charge transfer takes place only through electrons. But it seems to be a very good approximation for what we do, and that’s the reason why eventually we can find the force between an extended object, another extended object by looking at the force on everyone of these due to everyone of those and adding all the vectors. Then, you will find that you don’t get the shock because the wood doesn’t conduct electricity. So how will you vary the charge in a known way? You cannot, so they will split it evenly and therefore charge will split evenly to /2 here and /2 here. For everything make sure you can measure it. So every time you write something think about how you’ll measure it, because in that process you’re learning how the physics is done. See, it’s not like selling toothpaste where you can say it is 7.2 times whiter. A ,  and the 1 over 4is 9 times 10 to the 9. Maybe one example I can talk is about our own galaxy. So it’s dark to everything, but you cannot escape gravity. So people are trying to find dark matter. People at Yale are trying to find dark matter. All right, the final thing today before we break is that there’s one variation of Coulomb’s Law. So if you put another charge  here you want the force on this guy due to all these. But we will also take problems where the charges are continuous. You pick your radius , and the charge on it is continuous. And you want to find the electric force on some other charge  due to this wire. The force of this segment will be the charge — this segment is so small, you can treat it as a point charge, and the amount of charge here is  times . In other words, every one of them is making an equal contribution, so the integrand doesn’t depend on where you are in the circle, so you’re just measuring the length of the circle. You could put it underneath by negative . It should produce the coulomb force , or 4 times distance squared. So I would ask you whenever you do a calculation to test your result. I realize that you guys come from near and far, so when you come late let me give you my preference for doors, okay?"
813,physics,phys-201,lecture-20,Lecture begins with a detailed review of the double slit experiment with electrons. The fate of an electron traversing the double slit is determined by a wave putting an end to Newtonian mechanics. The momentum and position of an electron cannot both be totally known simultaneously. The wave function is used to describe a probability density function for an electron. Heuristic arguments are given for the wave function describing a particle of definite momentum.,"Well, this is just informal discussion till everybody’s in here. Okay, well, you know what, you guys should stop and ask more things as you go along, because there is just no way you could get all of this. Don’t wait for this to end, because it’s not something where you can go on the last day and figure everything out. It comes in when you do the famous double slit experiment. You block slit 1.In fact, let me say the following thing: what do we really know when we do the experiment? So I get  when 1 is open and I get  when 2 is open. And then you see how many are coming through this and how many are coming through that. And let’s say these downs really correspond to 0. and whatnot, and from that sin, where you get a minimum or a maximum, and if there’s a certain separation to the screen, you can find the precise location of these maxima or minima. What does it mean for the millionth + one electron? If  is the uncertainty in my position, and  is the uncertainty in momentum, I can make each of them as small as I like. I will take a slit with a very tiny hole in it. Anything who came out of hole right after it had to have a y position, whose known to within . So what should I do in this context to find out what it will do? Yes, you can put a screen, but what will I see on a screen? I’ve told you, the light will spread out. But sin, sinis controlled by , so this is . This wave is going to control the odds of where the particle will end up, and the odds are pretty much concentrated in this cone, not of 0 opening angle, but an angle , so that . Okay, so if I look at the single slit, I could think of many little point sources. I can find another angle where they differ by 2 wavelengths. No, in double slit, what’s happening is, we take — in double slit, the number  I used in double slit was not the size of a slit, but the space in between the slit, okay? This uncertainty in incoming momentum is unnecessary. It hits the electron and goes into the microscope. If I make it better, I’ve got to open this eyepiece a lot. When you think about it, you realize your trigonometric functions will not do the trick. And the prediction is that you get these oscillations, with the peculiar property that with two holes open, you don’t get anything somewhere. So you see, these uncertainties are not important in real life. In practice, no one can do the calculation. So probability’s being extended doesn’t mean the thing you’re looking at is extended. If anybody tries to give you an example, don’t believe it, because there are no examples in the macroscopic world that look like this. It’s like tossing a coin and it’s in my hand. We all know that when I reveal it to you, you can only get one answer, now that the toss has been done, it’s got one answer. When you don’t look, it’s wrong to assume it went through a definite slit. That’s because you don’t know which hole it went through. Can a little macroscopic object simultaneously be in two places? Most of them seem to have a well defined location. Because that bit is in contact with the world and the world is constantly measuring its value. These are all the odds for getting any number from 1 to 6. Then you cannot give a finite probability for any one . The only job of  is to give you the odds. So I’m going to keep this number , the height of the function, as a free parameter, and I’m going to choose is so that  — so that the  from - to + infinity, I want it to be 1. Now I want to make a quantum mechanical wave function that looks like the () =  squared over 2 D squared. So roughly speaking the width of this graph is of order  or 2. So that’s an electron whose location is roughly known to an amount . It will still tell you the relative odds of this and that, but you cannot say this interval from here to here, the chances are 30 percent for catching it. So what you will need, it seems reasonable to think, that this guy contained all the information on where you will find it, maybe there’s a different function of momentum, whose square will give you the probability density that you get — if that function looks like this and you square that, that’s the odds for getting one momentum versus another momentum. After all, every variable in classical mechanics you can measure in the quantum theory and you can give the odds."
814,physics,phys-201,lecture-21,The fact that the wave function provides the complete description of a particle’s location and momentum is emphasized. Measurement collapses the wave function into a spike located at the measured value. The quantization of momentum for a particle on a ring is deduced.,"So as usual, and as promised, I will tell you what we have done so far, and that’s all you really need to know, to follow what’s going to happen next. In other words, kinematics is a study of how to describe a system completely at a given time. So you will get something that will go to 0 here, go up, go to zero, do something like that. This is ψ, and that’s your probability density and what we mean by density is, if the function  has an area with the -axis like  that’s the actual probability that if you look for this guy you’ll find him or her or it in this interval, okay?So we will make the requirement that the total probability to find it anywhere add up to 1. And if ψ is a water wave 3 inches versus 30 inches are not the same situation, they describe completely different things. But in quantum mechanics ψ and a multiple of ψ have the same physics because the same relative odds are contained in them. Maybe that’s why you’re hesitating, but here is the possible function that describes a particle that’s location isn’t known to within some accuracy. On the other hand, I’m going to call is ψ  = 5. Now you can no longer tell me you have no feeling for these exponentials because it’s going to be all about the exponential. It’s got an imaginary part, but more natural to think of a complex number as having a modulus and a phase, and I’m telling you it’s a constant modulus. It may even be the case because we don’t know. A closed one-dimensional universe is a circle. It’s the size of the ring, but sometimes even if you’re not doing particle in a ring, if you’re doing particle in a line you just pretend that the line closes in on itself. You can find it anywhere with equal probability. If you go in real space, if you go on all the way it doesn’t come back to where you are. In other words I’m comparing the wave function at the point  and the point . This is the first time you realize this is the quantum of quantum theory. It’s whatever you like, but if it looked like one of these you’re in good shape because then the momentum is whatever  you find up here, but it may not look like that. If m is equal to 4 it means the cosine and the sine contained in the complex exponential finish 4 complete oscillations as they go around the cycle. So there are two questions one can ask at this point. Suppose I write the vector  as  times  +  times  +  times . He just said instead of saying this all the time, 1 if they’re equal, 0 if they’re different, why don’t you call it my symbol, the Kronecker’s symbol, . You’ve seen it anywhere?Here is the trick. I’m going to use a similar trick now in our problem. ψ is a particular function which I don’t want to write every time, but if you insist it is 2Π divided by √. So I’m trying to find this guy. I can build any vector out of these unit vectors. Because if you take the dot product of the two sides when you take dot product of  the only term who survives is . In quantum theory if you want to know what’ll happen if I measure momentum for a particle living in a ring you have to write the given function in terms of these special functions each item defined as a definite momentum with suitable coefficients. Some number  cosine 6Π, somebody gives you that function. What are the many odds is what we’re asking. I want you to write it in the form sum over  . So this is a good example that tells you only two of the m’s make it to the final summation. Now in a minute I will take on a more difficult problem where you cannot look at the answer, you cannot look at the function ψ and just by fiddling with it bring it to this form. I can write other functions, crazy functions for which you will have to do the integral to find the coefficient. In general the measurement will change the wave function from being in one of many options to the one option you got, but the answer depends on what you measure. So this is a particle whose position has an uncertainty of order 1/α. I hope you can see that this function is an even function of  because it’s mod . At the upper limit when you put infinity you get 0. Now you may be very nervous about doing this integral with a complex number in it because real we all know the integral is just 1/α . Whatever number this one is the other guy is obtained by changing  to -."
815,physics,phys-201,lecture-22,"It is shown how to extract the odds for getting different values of momentum from a generic wave function by writing it as a sum over functions of definite momentum. A recipe is given for finding states of definite energy, which requires solving a differential equation that depends on what potential the particle is experiencing. The particle in a box is considered and the allowed energies derived.","So I got an interesting email this weekend from two of your buddies, Jerry Wang and Emma Alexander. I want to do this every class so that it gets into your system. So it doesn’t tell you where the particle is. So my ψ looks like a square root of L. Let me see. If you take this guy and you square it and integrate it it’ll work because the square of this will be 2/L, and the average value of cosign squared is half. See, normally when you take a ψ(x), a generic ψ(x) that I draw, it typically has some non-zero value in all of space, so you can find it anywhere. That’s because my location’s being constantly measured. Need not be, it could have been even worse, but at least that much is true. So it’s not going to get any more familiar. It’s the wave function that’s spread out. In real life when you go forward I don’t think you need all of this. If you collapse it and you measure  then what happens to ? So right after the measurement of momentum you don’t know where the guy is, and you say, “Let me find this fellow.” Energy is a very, very important variable. We will see that the allowed energies of the systems are some special values. And from the frequency you can find the wavelength. For a particle moving in a potential you know that you have to add . And you don’t have to do an angular momentum measurement either. So the way to find energy is to do a whole other calculation. Even this recipe I’ll tell you how to get from a master recipe, so it’s not that many recipes, but I have to reveal that to you one at a time. Like all of Newtonian mechanics requires calculus. People are still discovering new mathematics. All I’ve done is just taken everything to one side and multiplied everything by 2and called that combination as . If the energy is  the momentum has to satisfy the condition /2 = . Probability for anti-clockwise is proportional to . With the mass is there going to be some kind of issue if that’s small? If the particle weighs a kilogram then you will find that — well, we’re coming to this. All I’m telling you now is that if you want to solve that equation it is obviously made up of sines and cosines as you recognize from the oscillator, or in the quantum world it’s more natural to write them in terms of exponentials,  and  where k is not independent of ,  satisfies this condition, and if you call  as ,  satisfies this condition. Not every value of momentum is allowed for the same reason as when I did particles of definite momentum. Because of the single valued condition  is quantized. So a particle in a ring has only these allowed values of energy. Here at every-energy it can have two different momenta, clockwise and anti-clockwise. There’s a very interesting piece of work being done experimentally at Yale which is the claim that if you took a metallic ring in a magnetic field it will have a current going one way or the other way, unbalanced current, and it’s not driven by a battery. So if the particle goes hits against the wall it cannot, no matter how fast it’s moving, go over the top because it’s infinitely high. This is region III where the potential is infinity. Then the solution to that is very easy, ψ =  +  where κ is equal to all of this, square root of 2 times . Because if you made the barrier height finite you will find it’s falling exponentially on either side, but the exponential becomes narrower and narrower as the barrier becomes higher and higher, and in the limit in which the wall is infinitely tall there is nothing outside. You can see if I take any of these solutions it’s going to satisfy the equation, but k better be related to E in this form,  is equal to . But that’s not allowed because we have an extra condition which is the ψ was identically 0 here, ψ was identically 0 here. We’re going to demand that at the two ends, it can do whatever it wants in the middle, it must vanish at the two ends for the continuity of ψ because if ψ had two values you’re getting two different probabilities for the same point, so that’s not allowed."
816,physics,phys-201,lecture-23,"The allowed energy states of a free particle on a ring and a particle in a box are revisited. A scattering problem is studied to expose more quantum wonders: a particle can tunnel into the classically forbidden regions where kinetic energy is negative, and a particle incident on a barrier with enough kinetic energy to go over it has a nonzero probability to bounce back.","Okay, so I’m going to begin with something I did last time, because it was not completed, then we’ll take it from there. And they’ll give you all the solutions of the equation. Since this combination appears all the time, I want to give it a name, . If you do it twice, it’s −. And  and  are arbitrary right now. But right now, I’m just giving you a recipe. Potential is where  depends on the context. If you want, you can put the square root of ’s and so on, but they’re all common to everything, so the relative probability is just in the ratio of  is to . But normally, if you wish, you may select from these mixtures, two special cases, one which is all  and one which is all . So this is how a quantum system is usually probed. You can make a length out of those things. I don’t guarantee that answer, but I think it’s something like that. In classical mechanics — by the way, the rule for doing quantum mechanics is, in classical theory, what’s the potential experienced by the particle? It can never be found here if it had this energy, because it’s got more — let’s see. Well,  varies with position, so there are three regions in the problem. That’s why we picked the potential, which is piecewise constant, so it’s some constant. We have the freedom, and the physical condition tells you, no one wants a function growing at infinity. This is the only function that falls at infinity. I’m taking  much, much bigger than any energy I’m looking at. That’s called going over the — well, it’s going into the classical forbidden region, but as the barrier gets higher and higher, the excursion into the forbidden region becomes less and less, because the function falls very rapidly. So even though it looked like, before we went to the other regions, you can have any  and any . If you’re only in the middle region, that’s correct. So it’s got more and more wiggles in the region in between, but they are designed so that they vanish precisely at the edges. If you square ψ, does that give the probability of finding it in each one, the energy levels? Then there is the state — let me draw it right there, it looks like that, =2 and so on. The equation that I’ve written here for the energy functions on the top, if size of  is a solution, you can multiply both sides by any number, like 15. is that, and you do that, you will get some energy. That means you cannot get the lowest energy So lowest energy is some number you can estimate by the uncertainty principle. In a real atom, the electron is forced to stay near the nucleus, because the 1 over  potential, if you plot it as a function of , looks like a well. In this problem, the particle is confined by the box. If I measure the energy of that guy, now you tell me, if I measure the energy in that state, what answer will I get? Write it as a sum of energy functions That’s correct. and the square of every one of them will give you the odds that you will find this energy or that energy or some other energy. It does not mean every particle in a box is in a state of definite energy. There’s nobody coming in from the right at + infinity, because I’m not sending anything from there. Because if you put  = 0, all the exponentials become one, and must = . The two functions coming from the left and right cannot join like this. Well, take the derivative and equate them at  = 0, you’ll find ik times =  times . What if your energy is like here, lower than the barrier?"
817,physics,phys-201,lecture-24,"The time-dependent Schrödinger Equation is introduced as a powerful analog of Newton’s second law of motion that describes quantum dynamics. It is shown how given an initial wave function, one can predict the future behavior using Schrödinger’s Equation. The special role of stationary states (states of definite energy) is discussed.","All right, today’s topic is the theory of nearly everything, okay? And you can say, “What happens when I measure any variable for a classical particle in this state, ?” But you cannot pick the acceleration at random, because the acceleration is not for you to decide. All higher derivatives are slaved to the applied force. You find out what they are from the equations of motion. They are consequences of pure mathematics. All other momenta are missing in that situation. It cannot get two different values of  when you go around the circle. Given the present, and the present means 0 is given, then you go to the math department and say, “This is my 0 Please tell me by some trick what is  and .” So I’m going to show you now that the equation does admit solutions of this type. Don’t ask me why it looks like  times , where are the derivatives? What do you think will happen if I divide by , ? So if you don’t follow something, you should tell me. If you pull a string like this and let it go, it will go crazy when you release it. Then the future of that will be / and t will be the  times , where  = That’s the energy associated with that function. I don’t care if you remember that or not, but this solves Schrödinger equation, and I call it  because the function of the right hand side are identified with states of definite energy. You put that in and you solve the equation and you will find a whole bunch of solutions that behave like this. So stationary states are very privileged, because if you start them that way, they stay that way, and that’s why when you look at atoms, they typically stay that way. If it’s in a state of definite , it should be that way forever. And what I really mean by that is, this problem  involves only the coulomb force between the electron and the proton. Therefore, just like in the lowest energy state, an oscillator has got some probability to be jiggling back and forth in  and also in . They are found by solving the Schrödinger equation without time in it. Nothing will change with time, not just  probability, so I’ll do one more example. This is called a phase factor, exponential of modulus 1, but when you take the absolute value, the guy doesn’t do anything. That’s why those states are very important. Okay, now I want to caution you that not every solution looks like this. So now I’m suddenly manufacturing more complicated solutions. Then the only question is, will it cover every possible situation you give me? So for any function we can think of it is true. If at  = 0 you expand your  as such a sum, where the coefficients are given by the standard rule, then as time goes away from  = 0, all you need to do is to multiply each coefficient by the particular term involving that particular energy. Let me take a simple case then I’ll build up the situation you want. I gave you an initial state, the future is very simple, attach the factor. This guy is what I would call  in my notation, the second highest state. That means they are the only 2 energies you can get. See, if you square these probabilities, you get 25, 3 + 4. So this has got a chance 3 is to 5 of being this or that energy. I’m just going to call it , + (4/5√(2/))sine (3) times eNow you notice that if I found the probability to be at sum , p(x,t), I have to take the absolute square of all of this. So first you take the absolute square of this. I’m asking you to see, do things depend on time or not? This has no time dependence because the absolute value of that vanished."
818,physics,phys-201,lecture-25,"The various postulates of quantum mechanics treated in previous lectures are reviewed and summarized. The uncertainty principle is again discussed and a new one between energy and time is introduced. The quantum mechanical behavior of an electron in a hydrogen atom is described. The principles of quantum mechanics are then generalized to describe two or more quantum particles. It is shown that identical particles have to be bosons or fermions, the latter obeying the Pauli exclusion principle, which in turn is key to explaining the periodic table.","So the rules of quantum mechanics are going to be stated for one last time. If you take a and you multiply it by a number, it stands for the same physical state. This is a function of , sovaries from - to + infinity. They are very special mathematical forms, and this is just for your own — you don’t have to know this part of it. ewill becometimes e. It becomes a completely new function. So we have the option of simply accepting the left hand side as postulate 2 and postulate 3, but there are equivalent ways to say this. In quantum theory, states of definite satisfy the equation where you first write the classical formula for. Either you can say states of definite energy are solutions to the following equation, that’s , and that’s what I’ve been doing so far, because I didn’t mind in this class to introduce it as one more postulate. is a particular value of namely the third value, the fourth value or the ninth value. And at  = 0, when you drop this guy, it agrees with the initial state and that’s all you want. It’s got a proton and it’s got an electron. Just like when the earth goes round the sun, in principle, the sun is also moving, but we ignore that, so we’re going to ignore the motion of the proton. These are all very interesting things you don’t know about the lives of famous people, but if you read his biography, you will find that Schrödinger’s wave function was all over the classically forbidden region. So you go to this equation and you solve it. If you solve this thing, what you find is that the energy can take only certain values. That 13.6 electron volts is some combination of the electric charge of Planck’s constant and mass of the electron. Remember this is energy 0 and this is  = 1. = 1 is at -13.6eV.  = 2 will be -13.6/4eV.  = 3 will be that thing divided by 9 and so on. But I’ll tell you what this means, but before that, I want to go back to the uncertainty principle, which you notice I never mention, because it is not a postulate, it’s a consequence. Again, uncertainty is a technical definition, but this is our qualitative explanation. This has nothing to do with quantum mechanics. Wavelength needs some time to express itself. It hasn’t had time to establish a period. Namely, it resonates with this guy, so your expectation is, this one will oscillate like crazy and the others will not. But what will happen in real life is that you will take the system and you start shaking it, your intention is to shake it at a very definite frequency that matches this guy, but the system does not know your plans. They will contain many, many frequencies, so what you will find is, this guy also oscillates a little bit, that guy also oscillates a little bit, and as you wait longer and longer, so the system caught on to the fact that you are really serious and sending a signal of definite frequency. So take this atom here in the ground state of hydrogen. But something very dramatic happens if the 2 particles are identical. There are 4 doors in this room and 1 twin comes out like this, the other twin comes out like that. The probabilities are not ; the probabilities are . And every particle is either boson or fermion. I don’t have time to talk about that, but this is the Pauli principle."
819,physics,phys-201,lecture-2,"The electric field is introduced as the mediator of electrostatic interactions: objects generate the field which permeates all of space, and charged objects in the field experience a force with magnitude proportional to their charge. Several instructive examples are given, including the field of an electric dipole and the notion of the electric dipole and dipole moment. The notion of field lines is introduced.","Okay, normally I would ask in a small class if there is something you didn’t follow from last time. And if your answer is yes, then you are fine. Because I talked about many, many things, but you don’t need all of that. In fact it is not that way if you make supreme, I mean, extremely exquisite measurements, but they occur really at the really quantum level. Now, I didn’t do one thing, which is to emphasize to you that the force of gravitation divided by the electric force is some number like 10 to the -40. Whereas if  is much smaller than , say,  is .1 of , so you can forget this number,  to the minus point is roughly 1, then this 10 will dominate the 1 over 100. But a time will come when the nucleus becomes so big, that even if you add enough neutrons, the repulsion between protons from one end of the nucleus to the other is now becoming comparable to the attraction due to the nuclear force, because nucleus has become so big this factor is no longer negligible. Electrical forces falls more slowly at like 1 over . So the correct way to do it, it’ll maybe come later in the course, so probably not even at the end of this course, but the proper way to do that is to in the end realize that the electric field at this point is not only due to what the charges are doing now, but what they were doing in the past. But if you promise me charges never move then the location now is the location last year, the location a million years ago, then you can use Coulomb’s Law. Charges don’t immediately interact with other charges. Once again, I will tell you if you want, you can write that as the position vector divided by the length of the position vector. And all these contours are different heights. If you’ve gone hiking, you can see those maps. So you want a pictorial representation of this electric field. That  is the electric field at that point. That’s what you guys should have been thinking in your head. And I sat through a lecture yesterday for an hour. I draw a sphere of some radius, 32 lines cross that sphere. I draw a bigger sphere, 32 lines cross this sphere also, but they’re less dense, because the number of lines per area will be some number of lines per charge divided by the area of the sphere, which is 4. If you take a sphere, first of all, every portion of the sphere the area that you have is perpendicular to the lines. And you see how many are crossing per unit area. But I’m going to make a certain choice that will make the number of lines per unit area exactly equal to the field, and here is the choice. Okay, so this is the way one likes to visualize field lines. Why does the field only depends on the one charge. Right, so that’s the intuition you should keep in your mind. In other words, not just the picture here, where is that? In other words, we all know the lines look like this, okay? You are saying why is it not ( + ) times ( - ), right? I borrowed a 2 to write this here and I canceled the 2 with the 4 here to get that. That only works if  is a lot bigger than . So this formula is good for all ; this formula is good only for  bigger than . You’ll find whenever you’re working with dipoles, people will always ask you to find the field very far from the dipole. Next is going to be, if I give you  can you find what will happen to the charge. Anybody tell me what the time will be when I go to that point? You can also use magnetic fields, but this is one simple way using electric field. So the plus charge will experience a force like that. Turn a screwdriver from  to , it goes into the board, and that’s the torque, and the dipole will then rotate until it lines up, or if you don’t want it to rotate you’ve got to provide a counter-torque of this magnitude. This is something I am assuming you guys know; the relation between potential and force. By comparing the two expressions you can identify () to be — sorry, this is () minus (), therefore () is equal to -cos, or just - dot .So that’s the final formula you have to remember, that the — can we bring it down here?"
820,physics,phys-201,lecture-3,"The electric field is discussed in greater detail and field due an infinite line charge is computed. The concepts of charge density and electric flux are introduced and Gauss’s Law, which relates the two, is derived. It is applied to the study of the electric field generated by a spherical charge distribution.","All right, class, I thought I’d start as usual by telling you what happened last time. You add all these vectors, they add up to something. That something is called the electric field at that point. The lines give you one piece of information which is very obvious, namely, if you are here, the force is along that line. You’ll see the advantage of that, because if you ask, what’s the density of lines here on a sphere of radius , if there’s charge  at the center, I got that many lines, and the area of the sphere is 4, so the density of lines per unit area, you see, is precisely equal in magnitude to the electric field at that point. Then I said, forget about the field due to charges. If you divide by the mass, that’s the acceleration, also pointing down, and it’s constant. So that’s like a particle in a gravitational field, except  is replaced by this number. What the sine of the angle does is to take the component of the force perpendicular to this axis, because if you resolve the force into that part and that part, this part is no good for rotation. As long as it’s not a frictional force, you can say the force is connected to potential energy in this following fashion. So what  does with forces,  does with rotations. Therefore the contribution from a positive  region is the same as the contribution from a negative  region. What that means is an integral  is related to an integral by this factor. itself is tan, therefore a times 1 + tan. If you tilt it in any one direction, you have no reason to do it. So those symmetry properties will come out of the wash, but it’s good for you to anticipate that, and that’s where you should look at the symmetry of the source. That means the field pattern should have the property, when you rotate it, it looks the same, because the same cause should produce the same effect. I take an annulus, and I ask, what will that ring do to this point? That charge will produce a force, 1/4Πε, square of the distance, r + a. Finally, here is where the symmetry comes in, can you see that for every section here, I can find an opposite section that will cancel everything but the part perpendicular to the plane? They all contribute to the same factor, so when I added the shaded region, I’ll just get the area of the shaded region. Now a prelude to that, you need a little more mathematical definitions, but they’re not bad. I want you to be able to visualize the area. Now I’ll tell you why that becomes useful. So the moral of the story is, ⋅, or ⋅ in general is the flux or the flow, off of any vector across an area. If you need the dot product, you need the cosine of the angle, because the area, if it’s not perpendicular to the flow, it’s not useful. In fact, you can take a huge area parallel to the flow and nothing goes through it. The area is on the surface and normal to that is the radial vector, which I always denote by . So you get /. In other words, either you can draw the picture and it’s immediately obvious to you the lines crossing is / by construction, or you can remember, “Hey, the electric field is a direct measure of the number of lines per unit area,” and the electric field times area times the cosine of the angle between the area and the electric field will count the lines going through a tiny area. Take the dot product of the  with the electric field there, and sum over all the patches covering the sphere. So how am I going to count the lines on a weird surface? If you want to count how many lines leave the charge, you can surround it with any surface you like. Here is some strange closed surface that’s a charge  inside. That times the ρ of , meaning ρ at ,  and , is the charge inside the cube. This is just a way of counting the total charge inside a volume when the charge is continuously distributed. I want to find the field here and I’m going to use Gauss’s law. On the right hand side, what is the charge enclosed? This whole thing is ,  spread over a sphere of radius , over . I’ll come back and do more examples for you guys next time."
821,physics,phys-201,lecture-4,"Lecture begins with a recap of Gauss’s Law, its derivation, its limitation and its applications in deriving the electric field of several symmetric geometries—like the infinitely long wire. The electrical properties of conductors and insulators are discussed. Multiple integrals are briefly reviewed.","Let’s start with a brief recall of Gauss’s Law. Now I’m going to calculate the left hand side, and I’m going to calculate the right hand side. Line density is going to be proportional to the charge you have because we agreed we’ll put some number of lines per coulomb, and it’s inversely proportional to the radius because the area of a sphere of radius  is 4. Left hand side of 1 is the number of lines crossing this sphere, S. So that’s going to be equal to — let me call it Φ is equal to number crossing S, crossing this sphere S. Φ is the standard symbol for flux. So the lines crossing every tiny little square on the big surface is the number of lines per unit area times the area times the cosine of the angle which you need, because the area vector may not be parallel to the flow. Then the surface integral of the electric field due to that charge over a surface is equal to the charge that is sitting inside divided by ε, and it does not depend on the details of the surface. Focus on the electric field for which there’s a very simple rule. So it might as well be that surface because double entering and leaving doesn’t matter. The first problem, I think I probably did that last time but it’s worth going over, is what is the electric field of a uniform density of charge. For example, you can take that surface and you can say surface integral of  on the surface is Q/ε, but that’s not very helpful because what you’re trying to find out is not the electric field integrated over a whole region, but the electric field at each point. You want to know what’s going on right there. You don’t do any integrals, but you do some serious arguing. At each point the repulsion has to be away from the center. In other words the electric field has to have this distribution. So the distribution you draw must be invariant under that rotation. So we know that  looks like , which is the vector of length in the radial direction times  of . The integral of a constant on the surface is the constant times the area of the surface. The answer I’m going to write down is the total charge is  on the whole ball. If I did that it’ll be fine with you, correct? So throughout the whole sphere if it’s a constant, it’s like the number 19, you just pull it and then you get  of  times integral  and that is my 4. So for a charge at the center of the spherical ball, and if you went to a sphere then the integrant is a constant. The charge you are enclosing grows like r cubed, and the distance from the center of that charge is r squared which comes downstairs. I take a sphere and I scoop a hole in it and I want the field here. I can equate these two if this area of vector and this area of vector were radiating outwards, and this is actually a true statement. That’s the most reliable way to prove 0 field. It’s charge per unit length times the length of wire trapped inside the cylinder and then, of course, I have this 1/. It still is a statement about the integral of  on the surface, and it could be any surface, but the beauty of this surface is the following. That really follows from the meaning of the word conductor. If you took a chunk of perfect conductor, maybe copper is good enough; they’ll be no electric field inside copper. But the point is once they’ve produced the potential, I mean, once they produce the field that cancels the external field there’ll be no field inside the bulk to encourage charges to move any more and that’s when they stop moving. Okay, so a conductor, at least in this case, not so hard to understand what they have to do. So these particles will always figure out a way to make the field 0 inside, because it’s the definition. So that’s a very short period, 10 to the minus something, when charges rearrange when you put a conductor in the field, then quickly it’ll stop. Well, the 10 million electrons don’t like each other. That’s going to be equal to the charge enclosed is σ/, because σ is the charge density which I assume I’m given. They can get weaker as you go away, but at a given distance from the plane they should have the same value, because if you slide the plane up and down it shouldn’t matter. That’s why it’s σ/ε outside and 0 inside. What is here does that as if it was an infinite plane. Therefore, there is no stable equilibrium in which the charges will be ever inside a conductor."
822,physics,phys-201,lecture-5,The law of conservation of energy is reviewed using examples drawn from Newtonian mechanics. The work-energy theorem is derived from first principles and used to initiate a discussion of the vector calculus underlying the law of conservation of energy.,"All right, guys, let’s start today with a new idea. Add the field due to this one, that one, that one, add that. And if there are much such charges, we can find what they all do in this environment, which is the background electric field. Unlike the electric force, the force on this mass is due to the spring. And this is called the work energy theorem. This is true no matter what the force is. If you knew the force, you can integrate it to get the potential. If you want to go right, it wants to act left. If you know it’s moving to the right, then the force is to the left. So even though the work energy theorem is valid, and no matter which path you take, the work done by the force will be the change in kinetic energy, this is not in general equal to some function at  - some function at . And you will see, when I do the calculation, the answer is different. The work is the force which is  times  times the distance. And if you go to negative values, it looks like this. So this is a force for which it’s not true, and I bet you that if you just randomly selected forces in the 2 dimensional plane, they will never have the property that the integral is path independent. The condition, namely of a conservative force, is that the integral from here to here is the same as the integral from there to there, from 1 to 2 along path  and 1 to 2 along path . So in my example,  will be - derivative partial means keep  as a constant, take the derivative with respect to . This force is guaranteed to be conservative. So we have to understand what makes this work. Now we are going to understand why a force manufactured in this fashion is conservative, okay? That becomes, except for this - sign, / times  + / times . You’re adding the height, your elevation. You can take a long path, you can take a short path. So what you’re manufacturing is pairs of potentials and forces. For every  that you dream up, there’s a force, which is obtained by gradient, - gradient of . And another condition,  goes back to ,  goes  — let’s see,  goes to ,  goes to  = /. I’m not worried about whether you write this down or not, but I do want you to know in 2 dimensions, you have to remember this condition. But that doesn’t give you a work energy — it gives you a work energy theorem, but not a law of conservation of energy, because this integral can depend on the path. If you pick any 2 paths, should be the same end points, so always the integral is not equal, that’s it. If it works for one charge, it will work for any arrangement of charges. gives 0 on any closed loop, other will give 0 on any closed loop. Here’s one charge and let me draw for convenience all the field lines coming out of it. So I’m going to take another path where I go tangent to the lines, along a circle. So you can approximate any contour by sequence of radial and angular moves. The change in potential energy is really  times , but  is the test charge, so I’m going to call this . And the force is going to be - the gradient of the potential energy. I don’t want to call  again, because  is the guy producing the potential. Put  over , position vector over , is the unit vector in the radial direction. I don’t want to spend too much time doing it. The first one is q/4 divided by 1/ - 1/ That’s it."
823,physics,phys-201,lecture-6,"The electric potential is defined for the electric field. It is introduced as an integral of the electric field making the field the derivative of the potential. After discussing the ideas of electric potential and field as presented in the previous lecture, the concept of capacitance is introduced as a means of storing charge and energy.","I will start by doing the usual stuff of just refreshing your memory on what happened last time. For example, if this is the ground there’s a mountain like that. So this is the old potential energy you want. The potential due to a charge here at the point here is a number given by this, and if you’ve got lots of charges that’s just fine. If you want it in the  direction, take the  derivative. I didn’t realize it myself and I wasn’t waiting for anyone to correct me. All the vertical parts add up to 1, so going zigzag is longer by a factor √2. So what’s the line integral on the radial path? You may not choose to go radial angle or radial angular. So if you don’t give the units the number is not worth anything. First thing is conservation of energy, there’s no need to belabor this point, I mean, that’s why we did the whole thing, the whole conservative forces, gradient, this, that, all that was to make sure in the end you can get a potential energy out of it. They are equal, if you sum them- so you can find one number from it. What makes life difficult is that if you go to this point here, this I explain to you last time, this guy will repel it with some force, this guy will attract it, and you’ve got to add the two arrows and get a new arrow. And that’ll give you the electric field  and  everywhere, okay? Then a little guy here produces a little potential  which is the charge  ( is not any distance it’s like the differential) divided by 4. But you don’t have to do that because in this problem because it’s spherically symmetric and there’s a charge  here we know from Gauss’s Law the electric field is going to be purely radial and will look like /4 as long as  is outside this sphere. So lines of  are vertical and lines of constant  are horizontal. Think of it as a plate coming outside the blackboard. When the charges that are pushing around are not coulombs but this tiny electron it’s good to know in electron volts. That means if you want to drag an electron from this hole and liberate it from the atom you’ve got to do 13 times 1.6 times 10 joules of work. You go further out it’s a different number depending on that radius and it falls like 1/. You’ll notice once again that the lines of constant potential are perpendicular to the lines of the field. If you release a marble in the gravitational field it’ll roll along the gravitational field which is obtained the same way from the gravitational potential. That we saw before, so we know all the charges in the metal are in the boundary. This is a solid metal, and  = 0 inside solid. They’ll keep moving until they have no reason to move. Because there’s a potential difference ________________. They will all terminate on the metal, and to terminate you need some negative charge which the metal will suck out of the ground. The reason is that we can solve this problem by borrowing from another problem. If  is constant you can slide in a conductor there and nobody will know, because the field is 0 along the surface of the conductor, nothing happens. That you can easily calculate at all points on the plane. So it cannot tell the difference and therefore if you’re releasing it it’ll move the same way in this problem as in the other problem. So that means the work I’ll have to do is equal to /4 + /4. The first guy, , had to fight only this one. Now, if you have a continuous set of charges you must replace a sum by the integral. At some intermediate stage, when the charge on this sphere is  and I want to bring in a charge , how much work do I have to do? When the charge is  the potential of the surface of the sphere is /4 over . So this is a good problem to explain the difference between potential and energy. σ is /. Yeah, this is what comes from knowing the answer. Therefore, the potential difference between these two points will be like the potential difference between these two points with a point charge of the origin, so  -  will be /4 times [1/ - 1/].Well, we are done because this is what I call ."
824,physics,phys-201,lecture-7,The lecture begins with a discussion of electric potential distribution in conductors. Image charges are introduced and exploited. Capacitance is explained in greater detail and illustrated using the parallel plate capacitor. The energy stored in the electric field is derived. The forces acting on an electric current flowing through a conducting wire are examined. The RC circuits and its energetics are discussed. The EMF due to a battery is explained.,"When I look at you guys, I realize that I don’t know what most of you look like. So that is that plane, and you have another charge, , you slowly bring towards that plane. So some bunch of charges will be drawn from the ground, as necessary, and this is what will happen. So if you know the electric field, you can find sigma, and I find the electric field very simply by saying that’s the repulsion from this , there’s an attraction from that . So what do you think you will do if you have that infinite plane? It will split into positive and negative charges. It will be very small, because you’re taking a charge  and you’re putting it on a huge disc, like the radius of the galaxy. That way the infinite plane will be a little strange, because you don’t see the richness of the phenomenon of the infinite plane because it can basically create negative charge and not fully account for the positive charge, because it’s smeared over a huge distance. So  is less than , and is at a distance  from the center, which is /. This is something you can do for fun. So the lines will terminate in the normal way. For that, you must find the voltage difference between the two plates, and you want to take  over . So the voltages difference will be the electric field times the distance, because that’s what the line integral will be. Then you can compare it to / and you can see  is ε/ So this is what I have done towards the end of class. And then you can see it is proportional to , and you take the ratio, you’ll get the capacitance of that. But you can also write it in another way. Little  is the energy per unit volume and that happens to be /2.In other words, it takes energy to establish the electric field. So in this room, if you’ve go to a tiny region where  is essentially constant over the tiny region. For the few of you that didn’t do it, you have a chance to keep up with the class. Therefore the current will be  times  (is the volume of stuff that’s gone), that’s the number of carriers in the volume, that’s the charge of each carrier. They’re going very fast but they’re going nowhere. The average velocity, which I denote with a bar, is obtained by averaging individual velocity. Some guys will have just collided; some won’t have collided for a long time. So this is the very, very important result. If you don’t have a field in a wire, the current doesn’t know which way to flow. The second  comes because the current it carries is itself proportional to . You understand?The charge of the carrier affects it in two ways. τ is what varies from problem to problem. The electric field times the length of the wire is the voltage difference between the two end points. So this is the relation between resistivity and the resistance. By the way, I should tell you, in a real solid, if you ask what do they collide into, can you imagine? If you’re an electron, you’re going through, you see a nuclei every whatever, 10 to the -8 centimeters, there’s another nucleus, but that’s not what matters. But no matter how sophisticated the calculation is, you can go to my office and ask, what are people doing for conductivity?Everyone is trying to compute this quantity τ and τ/. The , the , they’re all what you think they mean. So here’s one simple circuit I’m going to do. So when I close the switch, let me write down an equation for what will happen. is , because in a small time , when the current flows,  coulombs flow through here, but they’ve got to come from there. How long does it take for it to completely discharge? That’s the voltage driving the current through the resistor. Just take the derivative of this function times . At  = 0, is the voltage in the capacitor, divided by  as a current. So in this problem,  is Q/C and , I got somewhere here — I’m too close to the board to see where anything is. Now I’m not going to waste your time, guys. That’s certainly true, but in light of what we have learned, here is what is the correct way to think about it. But the current, you realize, has to flow up here. You can connect that guy to the resistor and the current will keep flowing."
825,physics,phys-201,lecture-8,"After a description of more complicated electric circuits, the basic ideas underlying magnetism are discussed and the relationship between electrical charges and magnetic fields is explored. Magnetism is caused and experienced only by moving charges. The Lorentz force on a charge is described and used to deduce the force on a current carrying wire. The cyclotron and velocity selector are described.","I’m going to do some leftover stuff from circuits, because I didn’t finish it last time. So I want you to remember the following things about a circuit. It is not done entirely with the electrostatic force. And that’s the non-conservative force that does the work. If you want, sum of all the change in voltage should be zero around a closed loop. you will apply voltage, you will measure the current and that ratio you will call . Initially you are told the capacitor’s empty, there’s no charge on it. So I get a + when I go through this battery. You can’t begin an experiment with charge on the capacitor. See, we all sort of know how to solve this equation. But in easy cases, you can solve it yourself. Yes, the battery had some internal energy. Well, the work done by the ski lift is the work it takes to carry each person from the bottom to the top, multiplied by the number of people. So if I’d kept the extra - sign, it will mean the current’s going against the battery and I would know that doesn’t work. You drop here, you drop here, then you come back. Then you can take another loop that goes like this. If you don’t know that, you may start writing all kinds of equations. Then you suddenly find the charge attracted to the wire. It doesn’t care if the charge is moving or not, so it is a new force. And if you use that as a direction of a certain field, you can draw these pictures and you sort of know what it’s going to look like. So how does a person in a moving train explain it? Maybe the rate will be different and so on, but the fact that it’s getting closer to the wire is undeniable. So let’s say I don’t know any magnetism, because the charge is at rest. You might say, “Oh, there’s a Lorentz contraction,” meaning the lengths get contracted, but if the wire is neutral, the positives and negatives all get compressed, it still should look neutral, but that’s not how it is. Now if the wire is neutral, I think you guys can understand that the density on this, in its own rest frame, will be different from the density of charges here, because lengths get contracted. This guy will stop moving; the other will move the opposite way. So when I say velocity is , I mean according to any one observer. If I tell you, what’s a magnetic field, you can take a coulomb there, but you still have to find out — by the way, the electric field problem’s very easy, because the direction of the electric field is simply the motion of the charge. That means the magnetic field is always perpendicular to the motion of the particle. So I want to show you that  is going into the blackboard. Therefore the total force on a charge will be  times , which is downstairs — I mean, pointing down, and x  which is pointing up. Electric force is a constant, magnetic force is velocity dependent. And I send a particle here with the velocity like this. So one thing you can do is you can take a little battery here, connect it to two plates. So it will lose a potential energy,  times . There’s going to be a force because there are guys moving in the wire. That’s the number of charges, per unit volume. Let’s see, so  is this way,  is out of the board, so let me set the current like this. And this is the normal to the plane, it’s the area vector. And this is called the magnetic moment of the loop. So if magnetic charges existed, this would be simply a magnetic dipole, aligning itself with the magnetic field, but in reality, there are no magnetic poles."
826,physics,phys-201,lecture-9,The mechanism by which electric currents produce a magnetic field (Law of Biot-Savart) is discussed in greater detail. The field due to a single loop and an infinite wire are computed. Ampere’s Law is derived. The operation of the DC electric motor is used to illustrate the torque generated on moving charges in a magnetic field.,"Okay, well I want to start by cleaning up a little bit of stuff done near the end of last time. Now that doesn’t mean that’s the right answer. One is the cross product, which is for me the screwdriver rule, that if you’ve got a vector  and you’ve got a vector , you turn the screwdriver from  to  and the way it comes out is the direction of the cross product. Another thing is, I didn’t tell you anything about units. By the way, it’s very useful to know a quick rule, is that the force on a segment, where everybody is perpendicular to everybody, is . So if you look at it that way, it looks like  times  times ,  being this length. Take the cross product, you will get the same force. So what are the forces on the four sides. By the way, when you compute torques, you can find the torque around this point or torque around that point, it doesn’t matter around which point, as long as the forces add up to 0, and finding it around this point. If you like, you can find the torque around the midpoint, then this will give a contribution, that will give an equal contribution. And the cross product, the vector formula for tau, is going to be written as  x , and  is a quantity which is area vector times the current, because  times  is the area. So this loop is really like a tiny compass needle. You can keep doing this and you can keep reversing the current. μ/4Π, like 1/4Πε is a number whose value happens to be 10 in the units we are using. The only vector you’ve got is from the charge to the location. Here the current is coming out of the blackboard, and here the current is going into the blackboard. You’ve just got to integrate , which will be 2. Now that is supposed to remind you again of a dipole. Just like the electric dipole aligns with the electric field, the magnetic dipole aligns with the magnetic field. The only difference is, if you go into an electric dipole, you’ll find two guys, + and -, producing the field. But we don’t see them the way we see electric charges to be sure they exist. Your magnet’s not connected to anything, so you have an option. Do you know where the currents are in a bar magnet? In every layer it’s got orbits, and each one is like a current. Okay, now I’m going to find the magnetic field for a very classic problem, and that’s the field of an infinite wire. So what you can imagine is that I just happened to slice it in this plane, but the real picture is, the field lines will go around the wire. Right now they’re coming out of the blackboard. You make the tangent substitution and then get secant this and secant that. emanates from charges, but has no circulation. It’s going to cancel out, but I’m not taking a fixed length . Yes, Gauss’s law, where you took a single charge, the surface integral of was independent of the size of the sphere, because the field went like 1 over . Then I’m going to show you that the answer is independent, even of the shape of the loop. So take a portion of that loop, this portion here. You take that loop and you draw a plane with that loop as a boundary. It turns out this is all you really need to determine electric and magnetic fields. And in the plane perpendicular to it, the field should be invariant when you rotate the wire, because the wire looks the same when you rotate it. If you go inside this and ask, what’s the magnetic field on a circle lying inside this, then again you can say 2Π times  = μ times the current that’s enclosed by that loop, not the entire current. And you can test the formula when little ."
827,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-10,"The lecture begins with an introduction of Machiavelli’s life and the political scene in Renaissance Florence. Professor Smith asserts that Machiavelli can be credited as the founder of the modern state, having reconfigured elements from both the Christian empire and the Roman republic, creating therefore a new form of political organization that is distinctly his own. Machiavelli’s state has universalist ambitions, just like its predecessors, but it has been liberated from Christian and classical conceptions of virtue. The management of affairs is left to the princes, a new kind of political leaders, endowed with ambition, love of glory, and even elements of prophetic authority.Niccolo Machiavelli, , translated by W.K. MarriottCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","Because it’s a makeup class, we’ll do something a little special. Blood shed and murder and Leonardo da Vinci and the Renais sance. And because Dante says that to have understood without retention does not make knowledge, I have noted what capital I have made from their conversations and have composed a little work on principalities, where I delve as deeply as I can into reflections on this subject, debating what a principality is, of what kinds they are, how they are acquired, how they are maintained, and why they are lost. For it is far from how one lives to how one should live. Murders, conspiracies, , these are the kinds of political phenomena he is interested. Consider, just for a moment, the title and dedication of the book. In one of the most famous chapters of the book, chapter 6, entitled, “Of New Principalities that are Acquired Through One’s Own Arms and Virtue,” there is that word again, , one’s own arms and virtue, Machiavelli discusses the character of the modern prince, the new prince. “ In other words, set your sights high, knowing you will probably fall short. They had nothing else from fortune,” he says, again, “than the opportunity,” the occasion, that “gave them the matter enabling them to introduce any form they please.” The most obvious answer is a person to whom God speaks. You might even think in your class, in your sections, how or in what ways does Machiavelli’s armed prophet differ in important ways both from Plato’s philosopher king, as well as Aristotle’s notion of the  as the sort of magnanimous statesman. Machiavelli’s prophetic prince, in other words, must have some of the qualities of a philosopher, as well as a religious reformer trying to reshape and remold human opinion, especially opinion over, as we said, good and evil, just and unjust. And in perhaps the most important book on Machiavelli ever written, the author of that book declared Machiavelli to be a teacher of evil. What distinguishes Machiavelli’s use of this language of , manliness, is that he seeks to locate it in certain extreme situations, such as political foundings, changes of regimes, wars, both of domestic and foreign kinds. Machiavelli takes his bearings from these extreme states of emergency and in his own way, seeks to normalize them, to present them as the normal condition of politics. The paradox that, you might say, runs throughout all of Machiavelli’s morality is that the very possibility of virtue grows out of and, in fact, is even dependent upon the context of chaos, violence, and disorder that always threatens the political world. It is in these times, you might say, when individuals of extraordinary virtue and capacity, prophetic qualities, as he calls it in chapter 6, are most likely to emerge."
828,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-11,"The discussion of Machiavelli’s politics continues in the context of his most famous work, The Prince. A reformer of the moral Christian and classical concepts of goodness and evil, Machiavelli proposes his own definitions of virtue and vice, replacing the vocabulary associated with Plato and the biblical sources. He relates virtue, or virtu, to manliness, force, ambition and the desire to achieve success at all costs. Fortune, or fortuna, is a woman, that must be conquered through policies of force, brutality, and audacity. The problem of “dirty hands” in political and philosophical literature is discussed in detail.Niccolo Machiavelli, , translated by W.K. MarriottCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","Last time, I ended by talking about Machiavelli as both a revolutionary in many ways and a reformer of the moral vocabulary about virtue and vice, good and evil. But in order to understand or to discover the core of Machiavelli’s teachings about religion, I have to make a slight detour away from  and to his  and in maybe the most important chapter of that book, Book II, chapter 2, called “Concerning the Kinds of People the Romans had to Fight and how Obstinately they Defended their Freedom,” a long title for a chapter to be sure, but here Machiavelli develops a powerful contrast between two opposed and mutually incompatible moral codes, the Christian and the pagan. “ Let me quote Machiavelli’s passage from the  at some length because I think it’s very revealing: “Our religion,” he writes, obviously thinking of the Catholic Christianity of his time. “ And it is not for Machiavelli simply the existence of these two different moralities that is at stake. By softening morals, he believes, by making us gentler, Christianity has had some deeply perverse effects upon politics, so he claims. Its moral seems to be “trust in God’s promises, yes, but bring a knife just in case.” The Christian virtue of humility, turning the other cheek, forgiveness of sins, must be rejected if you want to do good as opposed to just being good. You have to learn, in other words, how to get your hands dirty. Yet it seems inconceivable that Machiavelli wrote an entire book simply to prove the obvious, that is to say that the strong will always crush the weak and that politics is left to those who leave their scruples at the door. The prince must know how to chasten the ambition, to humble the pride, as it were, of the great and powerful, and this, we will see as early as Wednesday, becomes a major theme in the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes, humbling or chastening the pride of the few. One must know the times and character of a people. The new prince, as we’ve seen, must know how to use religion but needs to learn how not to be used by religion, must not become a dupe of the religious. Machiavelli’s republic feeds on conflict, on war and conquest. It was Machiavelli’s admiration for the politics, what someone once called the lupine politics, the wolf-like politics, of republican Rome that led him to understand that all social and moral goods have been established by morally questionable means. What was previously taught only subtly and in private will now be taught openly and in public."
829,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-12,"This is an introduction to the political views of Thomas Hobbes, which are often deemed paradoxical. On the one hand, Hobbes is a stern defender of political absolutism. The Hobbesian doctrine of sovereignty dictates complete monopoly of power within a given territory and over all institutions of civilian or ecclesiastical authority. On the other hand, Hobbes insists on the fundamental equality of human beings. He maintains that the state is a contract between individuals, that the sovereign owes his authority to the will of those he governs and is obliged to protect the interests of the governed by assuring civil peace and security. These ideas have been interpreted by some as indicative of liberal opposition to absolutism.Thomas Hobbes, Courtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","Thomas Hobbes was the author of the first and, I believe, undoubtedly the greatest, work of political theory written in the English language. Hobbes, in other words, carried out what Machiavelli had helped him make possible. He was the Lewis and Clarke or the Columbus. Modern political science, he said, began with this book of 1642. So there, you see Hobbes laying down a challenge. he asks, rhetorically in the introduction. “ And furthermore, Hobbes not only criticized, you might say, the foundations, the motivational and psychological foundations, of Aristotle’s theory of politics and human nature, he blamed the influence of Aristotle for much of the civil conflict of his age. This was, again, the thesis of the classical republicans according to which we are only fully human, or we only become fully human, when we are engaged in political life, in ruling ourselves by laws of our own making. And it is precisely this desire to be self-governing, you might say to rule directly, to have a direct part in political rule, that Hobbes saw as one of the great root causes of civil war. The sovereign representative acts, you might say, like a filter for the wills and passions of the people. In other words, instead of seeking to participate directly in political rule, Hobbes wants us to abstain from politics by agreeing to be ruled by this artificial man, as he calls it, this artificial person or representative that he gives the name “the sovereign. Now, his language in that sentence that I just read from the introduction, “For by art”, again, “is created that great Leviathan called a commonwealth or a state.” Through art, again, is created the great Leviathan. And, again, that is not just what constitutes authority, but what makes authority legitimate. This is the natural condition, the state of nature, the state of war that Hobbes attributes to, again, the fundamental fact of human nature. Now, his claim that the state of nature is the condition that we are naturally–the state of war, rather, is a condition that we are naturally in, is to say, among other things, that nature does not unite us in peace, in harmony, in friendship, or in solidarity. In other words, for Hobbes, authority and relations of authority do not arise naturally among us, but are rather, again, like civil science itself, the product of contrivance or art."
830,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-13,"Hobbes’ most famous metaphor, that of “the state of nature,” is explained. It can be understood as the condition of human life in the absence of authority or anyone to impose rules, laws, and order. The concept of the individual is also discussed on Hobbesian terms, according to which the fundamental characteristics of the human beings are the capacity to exercise will and the ability to choose. Hobbes, as a moralist, concludes that the laws of nature, or “precepts of reason,” forbid us from doing anything destructive in life.Thomas Hobbes, Courtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","Today we’re going to continue the state of nature, Hobbes’s most famous discovery, his most famous metaphor, his most famous concept. How could grim and dour old Thomas Hobbes be regarded as a moralist or someone with a moral conception of human nature and the human condition? Life for Hobbes is an exercise in continual willing and continual choosing that may be temporarily interrupted but can never come to an end except with the end of life itself. If all knowledge, according to Hobbes, ultimately rests on agreement about shared terms, he infers from that that our reason, our rationality, has no share in what Plato or Aristotle would have called the divine , the divine intelligence. The emphasis on the individual is just another way of saying, again unlike Aristotle, that no one has natural authority over anyone else. What opinion, Hobbes asks, he has of his fellow subjects when he rides armed? Maybe you’ll now believe Hobbes if you don’t believe me. How do I give up my right to do whatever is in my power to secure my person or my possessions, when I have no expectation, you might say, that others around me are prepared to do so as well? And although I have said that Hobbes has emphasized the diversity of our passions there are still two main passions that he feels universally dominate human nature and these two passions are pride and fear. And it is part of the broader educational or pedagogic function of  to help us see, Hobbes thinks, the dangers of pride and the advantages of peace. Here is Hobbes’s rewriting of the Golden Rule in terms of these laws of nature but these raise a question for us as readers of Hobbes. In this sense, the laws of nature, as he describes them, appear to be moral laws with moral commands, commands you not to do anything that is destructive of life, your own or that of others, and these moral laws, in this sense, we have presumably the freedom to obey them or disobey them. If they acted with a kind of mechanical necessity or even geometric necessity, they could not possibly be moral laws in that way. So these laws of nature, seek peace and so on, do not simply seem to be descriptive of how people do behave. And he calls these laws, these 19 laws of nature, the true and only moral philosophy. Hobbes, more than anyone else, wants us to value the virtues of civility. Doesn’t Hobbes or does Hobbes’s attempt to instill in us, the readers of his book, his attempt to instill in us an appreciation for life and the value of life, does this simultaneously create an aversion to risk, an extreme fear of conflict and challenge or disorder?"
831,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-14,"The concept of sovereignty is discussed in Hobbesian terms. For Hobbes, “the sovereign” is an office rather than a person, and can be characterized by what we have come to associate with executive power and executive authority. Hobbes’ theories of laws are also addressed and the distinction he makes between “just laws” and “good laws.” The lecture ends with a discussion of Hobbes’ ideas in the context of the modern state.Thomas Hobbes, Courtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","I’m going to show another movie today but not until a little bit later in the class. There are two great concepts that come out of Hobbes that you have to remember. One is the state of nature and the other is sovereignty. It is the people who endow the sovereign with the authority to represent them on their behalf. I think Uriah might have had a different point of view about this. ”This is the force or purpose of law to set rules, to keep people, as he puts it, on their way, a law that is intended simply to constrain and control for its own sake, Hobbes says, cannot be a good law. But the power to control or the power of law for Hobbes also very much applies and here is one of his most controversial doctrines. And these comments of Hobbes’s about the sovereign’s power to control opinions are directed at two principal institutions, the Church and, guess what the other one is, the university. By the churches, Hobbes is speaking of the reformed church but, in particular, he is concerned with those radical puritan sects of the type that later came and founded America, these radical sects that elevate matters of conscience and private belief over and above the law, that is to say arrogating to themselves, to the rights of conscience and the private belief, the powers to judge the sovereign. And this is so interesting, I think, not only because of its humor and Hobbes’s in many ways characteristic exaggerations, but because it shows how much emphasis Hobbes puts on the reform of opinion, the reform of ideas, in many ways like Machiavelli and like Plato too before him, Hobbes regards himself as an educator of princes, an educator and a transformer, a reformer of ideas. But he also obviously writes that we are beings with will and purpose who are uniquely guided by opinions, ideas, and doctrines and it is in many ways the first business of the sovereign to act as a moral reformer of ideas. The ideal audience for the book,” he says “should be the preachers, the gentry, the lawyers, men of affairs, who drawing such water as they find from the book can use it,” he says, “to sprinkle the same both from the pulpit and from their conversation upon the people.” Hobbes enjoys describing the sovereign in the most absolute and extreme terms. And it follows, I think, that the purpose of the sovereign is really to safeguard the natural right of each individual but to regulate this right so that it becomes consistent with the right of others and not simply again a kind of open war against all. In other words, liberty for the ancients was a collective good, the liberty, as he says, to resist or invade other people. It was a property of the commonwealth not of the individuals who inhabited it. Living in a republic alone doesn’t guarantee you more freedom. He says, freedom in that interesting passage, freedom here requires, as he puts it, immunity, “immunity from service.” But Hobbes is best when he is providing us with, in many ways, the moral and psychological language in which we think about government and the state."
832,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-15,"John Locke had such a profound influence on Thomas Jefferson that he may be deemed an honorary founding father of the United States. He advocated the natural equality of human beings, their natural rights to life, liberty, and property, and defined legitimate government in terms that Jefferson would later use in the Declaration of Independence. Locke’s life and works are discussed, and the lecture shows how he transformed ideas previously formulated by Machiavelli and Hobbes into a more liberal constitutional theory of the state.John Locke, Courtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","It’s so nice to see you again on this gorgeous autumn day. Yet, Locke did not arise , nor did anyone. But it’s a very interesting book, in its own right, of in many ways, biblical criticism and exposition. He was just a boy in school when a king, Charles I, was executed and he was an adult when another king, James II, was overthrown and forced into exile. So those are a few things about his contributions and his context. It is not simply a condition of war, of all against all. So the natural condition, for Locke, is a moral state, one in which a natural law, again, dictates the peace and preservation. The state of nature is a condition without civil authority. The law of nature, in other words, has no person or office to oversee its enforcement or its application. So this state of nature that he once describes, or early describes in the book is a condition of peace and mutual distrust, quickly degenerates into a condition of civil war, or of war, where every individual serves as the judge, jury, and executioner of the natural law. They “have no other rule but that of force and violence,” so also, they may be treated as beasts of prey, “those dangerous or noxious creatures that will be sure to destroy him whenever he falls into their power.” This is what I’ve come to think of as Locke’s bestiary, and in fact, the  is rife with language of comparing human beings and our behavior to animals. So you can see, again, how these ideas penetrate deeply into the marrow of our public or political culture. Economy, you might say, was always subordinate to the polity. Locke gives, in other words, to commerce, to money-making, to acquisitiveness, a kind of pride of place and a sort of moral status, you might even call it, that it never enjoyed in the ancient and medieval worlds."
833,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-16,"In the opening chapters of his Second Treatise, Locke “rewrites” the account of human beginnings that had belonged exclusively to Scripture. He tells the story of how humans, finding themselves in a condition of nature with no adjudicating authority, enjoy property acquired through their labor. The lecture goes on to discuss the idea of natural law, the issue of government by consent, and what may be considered Locke’s most significant contribution to political philosophy: the Doctrine of Consent.John Locke, Courtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection",": Today we want to begin with Mr. Locke, Part II. Man, he tells us in these opening chapters, is a property-acquiring animal, the acquisitive animal, even in the state of nature where there is again nothing but the natural law to govern human associations and relations with one another. No one prior to Locke, at least to my knowledge, I think, had ever said in quite such a bold and straightforward way that the purpose of politics was the protection of property rights. Property, for him, implies more than simply real estate, but everything that encompasses our lives, liberties, and possessions. The state of nature was, for Hobbes, a kind of state of existential dread, absolute fearfulness. I don’t mean what is it about him in some psychological, personal, or biographical sense, but what is it in his writing that leads him to emphasize the restlessness, uneasiness, and you might say perpetually anxious character of human beings in the state of nature? Or does Locke’s emphasis on the uneasiness of our condition in the natural condition really represent the qualities of a new class, the new commercial classes as it were seeking to establish their legitimacy?Locke’s  in many respects is a work of middle class or as the Marxist would like to say, perhaps the bourgeois ascendancy. In chapter 8 of the , Locke gives us there, he provides us with a kind of hypothetical reconstruction of the origin of society, of all societies. ”What are we to make of this assertion and in many ways, continued assertion, that in any community, we are ruled by the majority? We cannot cede our rights entirely to another individual. But it is Locke’s language of consent that just powers of governments derive from consent that seems to have most inspired Jefferson and the founders. Locke is not altogether clear about how such a sign or a mark is to be given. Locke is aware that not everyone gives their active consent. But again, that would be one way but again, how do we know when silence confers tacit consent or silence is simply that, silence? He writes in section 93, referring to Hobbes, but you’ll also see his wonderful animal references. It’s a very important chapter and I want us to continue this and then talk a little bit about the pros and cons of Lockean political philosophy."
834,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-17,"In this lecture, two important issues are addressed in the context of Locke’s Second Treatise. First, there is discussion on the role of the executive vis-a-vis the legislative branch of government in Locke’s theory of the constitutional state. Second, Locke’s political theories are related to the American regime and contemporary American political philosophy. The lecture concludes with John Rawls’ book, A Theory of Justice, and how his general theory relates to Locke’s political ideas.John Locke, Courtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","I want to in, a way, conclude my interpretation, my reading of the , by focusing on the role of executive power in Locke’s theory of government, Locke’s theory of the constitutional state, particularly focusing on the role of the executive, vis-a-vis the legislative branch of government, and then I want to turn a little more speculatively to thinking about Locke and the American regime and the current state of political philosophy, modern contemporary American political philosophy. In England, in the England at his time and even today, that means a doctrine of what is called parliamentary supremacy but he says that the first and fundamental positive law of all constitutions is in establishing that of the legislative power. It is not so much executive power, the power of a prince, but rather the legislature, the parliament that is supreme. He raises this question to be sure, of fundamental importance for constitutional government. So from Schmitt’s point of view you might say this idea of prerogative is a kind of extra constitutional power that the statesman must of necessity utilize when ordinary constitutional operations, like the rule of law, prove to be inadequate. Are we living in that kind of age now, not rebellion perhaps but invasion? I won’t go through chapter 19, the famous chapter on revolution in full, to talk about the conditions under which he believed the people can rightfully appeal to Heaven, as it were, but Locke’s doctrine of consent and legislative supremacy, this should make him in many ways a hero to Democrats, to radical Democrats. In the end, I think Locke was neither or both. No one who reads Locke, even superficially, and I would not accuse anyone here of being a superficial reader, after all, but no one can fail to be impressed by the harmony, in many ways, between Locke’s writings and those of the American Republic that he helped to found. That was Hartz’s line, that was Hartz’s quote, “irrational Lockeanism,” by which he meant a kind of closed commitment to Lockean principles and ideals that shut off all other political alternatives and possibilities. There has been much ground for criticism of this peculiar affinity between Lockeanism and America. For Locke, going back to chapter 5 of the , rights derived from a theory of self-ownership. Your intelligence or your drive or your endowments are, again, what he calls a collective asset. Interestingly, again, this transition, this evolution represents a change which has gone on within in many ways the liberal tradition itself. America, he believed, remained something of a Lockean remnant–a Lockean, yeah, remnant, fossil in some ways, in a world increasingly governed by more radical forms of modernity."
835,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-18,"This lecture is an introduction to the life and works of Rousseau, as well as the historical and political events in France after the death of Louis XIV. Writing in a variety of genres and disciplines, Rousseau helped bring to fruition the political and intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment. Among his most important works is the Second Discourse (Discourse on Inequality), in which Rousseau traces the origins of inequality and addresses the effects of time and history on humans. He goes on to discuss a number of qualities, such as perfectibility, compassion, sensitivity, and goodness, in an attempt to assess which ones were a part of our original nature.Jean-Jacques Rousseau, , translated by Ian Johnston© Ian Johnston","I hope that everybody followed Rousseau’s advice and yesterday exercised your rights as citizens of a free state. If anybody wants to do more advanced work in Rousseau, you will no doubt get this edition, better translations, better notes and so on, of the  and The  and for anybody who’s interested, I’ve decided because Rousseau has become so important to me, that next year I will be offering an undergraduate seminar entirely devoted to Rousseau. Rousseau wrote in many and varied genres and his work spans the entire gamut of philosophical, literary and political themes. Just remember, for example, you’ve probably all heard the famous opening sentence of the, “man is born free but is everywhere in chains,” his appeal to the severe political ethics of ancient Sparta and Rome as well as his belief that the people, in their collective capacity, are the only legitimate source of sovereignty. In this work, Rousseau seems to lay the basis for the kind of romantic individualism that would be associated with people like Wordsworth in England or Henry David Thoreau in America. Rousseau’s direct appeals to Nature as well as his celebration of the simplicity of peasant life and rural life seemed to open the door later on to writers like Tolstoy as well as to various kinds of social experiments in rural communal utopianism such as, for example, the Israeli kibbutz movement, which is in its own way a direct descendant of Rousseau. Here is your history, as I have read it, not through other books but through nature, he says, that seems to speak directly to me or to which I have an insight. War and the passions that give rise to war can only come into being once we are in society. Human nature is little different from animal nature and, in many ways, Rousseau delights in…you can see this in his footnotes in particular…in investigating stories about orangutans and other species that he believes, in many ways, are our distant ancestors. But Rousseau seems to add to this something different. He also says it is that which is at the source of our miseries and our discontents. Did we not feel pity for a fictional creature that could not exist but yet whose fate somehow affected us in some way? Reason, he writes, is what engenders egoism and reflection strengthens it. The development of rationality, he thinks, simply hastens our corruption by the assisting in the development of different vices and the task of the , at least its rhetorical task, is in many ways to recover our natural selves, compassionate, gentle, kind, from the artificial, corrupt and calculating selves we have all become in civil society. When Voltaire wrote–read, rather, the  he said, “never has so much intelligence been expended in the attempt to turn us back into brutes” and that is clever but it’s not really right. A return to the state of nature is impossible for us for the same reason it would be like returning a domestic animal back to the wild. But that’s only part of the story and what I want to do for next week is tell another very important, in some respects even more important, part of that story of how we have become the way we are."
836,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-19,"The discussion on the origins of inequality in the Second Discourse continues. This lecture focuses on amour-propre, a faculty or a disposition that is related to a range of psychological characteristics such as pride, vanity, and conceit. The Social Contract is subsequently discussed with an emphasis on the concept of freedom and how one’s desire to preserve one’s freedom is often in conflict with that of others to protect and defend their own. General will becomes Rousseau’s solution to the problem of securing individual liberty.Jean-Jacques Rousseau, , translated by Ian Johnston© Ian Johnston","Had to cheer myself up a little bit after Saturday afternoon but there’s still another week to go. Rousseau very much takes the side of the poor and the dispossessed but it isn’t property, or it isn’t poverty rather, that really rouses Rousseau’s anger as it is the attitudes and beliefs shaped by inequalities and of wealth and power. How can this passion of  be responsible for these two very different sort of competing effects? Rousseau speculates about this and, again, this is part of his hypothetical or conjectural history. From this came the first duties of civility even among savages and from this every voluntary wrong became an outrage. Acts of revenge became terrible and men became bloodthirsty and cruel.” It is their beliefs that were being disrespected and were the cause of the protests. For Rousseau, there is something deeply shocking and deeply troubling about the assertion that men who were once free and equal are so easily, as it were, led to consent to the inequalities of property and to rule by the stronger, which government brings into being. One is suggested, you will recall, by the letter to the City of Geneva which, in a sense, prefaces the book. We have lost our true humanity that he describes in the state of nature, our state of–our capacities for pity and compassion and the like, and the answer to the problem of society is, in many ways, to return to the root of society and this root of society is not just the need for self-preservation but a kind of primordial, as he calls it in that passage I read a minute ago, sentiment of existence, the sentiment of our own existence. But it requires you, in some way, to distance yourself severely and psychologically from all of the possibilities of society, to return inward, and it was that inward journey that Rousseau took and that he writes about so powerfully in his and his final book, , where you find the Rousseau, founder of the romantic disposition that you get again in writers in America like Thoreau and others who look inward and return to nature in some way, their natural self as opposed to society. It is what follows after that sentence in a way that is the shocker. The book, he tells us in short preface, was originally part of a longer investigation of politics which has since been–which he says has since been lost. There is nothing natural about any of the social contract. So meditate on that if you like for the next day."
837,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-1,"Professor Smith discusses the nature and scope of “political philosophy.” The oldest of the social sciences, the study of political philosophy must begin with the works of Plato and Aristotle, and examine in depth the fundamental concepts and categories of the study of politics. The questions “which regimes are best?” and “what constitutes good citizenship?” are posed and discussed in the context of Plato’s Apology.Plato, , translated with an introduction by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","Let me start today by asking the question, “what is political philosophy?” It exists alongside of other areas of political inquiry like American government, comparative politics, and international relations. Yet in another sense, political philosophy is something much different than simply a subfield; it seems to be the oldest and most fundamental part of political science. In this respect it seems to me much less like just a branch of political science than the foundation of the entire discipline. Doesn’t political science make any progress? So political philosophy is not just some kind of strange historical appendage attached to the trunk of political science; it is constitutive of its deepest problems. But one thing we should not do, right, one thing we should not do is to approach these works as if they provide, somehow, answers, ready-made answers to the problems of today. And what does that imply for our obligations as human beings and citizens? It goes back to Plato and even before him. The  is a book about the regime and all later political philosophy is a series of footnotes to Plato, and that means that it must provide a series of variations, so to speak, on Plato’s conception of the best regime. The political world does not present itself as simply an infinite variety of different shapes. There we see Hamilton asking the basic question about the founding of political institutions: are they created, as he puts it, by “reflection and choice,” that is to say by a deliberate act of statecraft and conscious human intelligence, or are regimes always the product of accident, circumstance, custom, and history?But the idea that regimes may be created or founded by a set of deliberate acts raises a further question that we will study, and is inseparable from the study of regimes. This issue received a kind of classic formulation in Aristotle’s distinction of what he called the good human being and the good citizen. For the good citizen–we’ll read this chapter later on in the –for the good citizen you could say patriotism is enough, to uphold and defend the laws of your own country simply because they  your own is both necessary and sufficient."
838,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-20,"The concept of “general will” is considered Rousseau’s most important contribution to political science. It is presented as the answer to the gravest problems of civilization, namely, the problems of inequality, amour-propre, and general discontent. The social contract is the foundation of the general will and the answer to the problem of natural freedom, because nature itself provides no guidelines for determining who should rule. The lecture ends with Rousseau’s legacy and the influence he exercised on later nineteenth-century writers and philosophers.Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Courtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","There’s so much to say and so little time. But secondly, when we alienate ourselves, it is crucial, he says, that this be done or given to the entire community, for only then he wants to argue, is the individual beholden not to any private will or any private association, or to some other person but to the general will, the will of the entire community. Is Rousseau’s formula for the general will, a recipe or a formula for freedom, or is it a recipe for the tyranny of the majority of the type later analyzed by Tocqueville that we’ll be seeing after the break?Rousseau wants to say, paradoxically, only through this total alienation do we remain free. One might call them liberal and republican respectively, small “r” republican of course or democratic even, if you like. He wants to dignify politics again by leading to a higher form of nobility or does it result in a new kind of despotism, the despotism of law, the despotism of obedience to the general will and of course underlying that sinister reading of Rousseau is the famous or maybe infamous statement that not only that the general will is the source of freedom, but that anyone who obeys, who refuses to obey, the general will may be in his famous formulation, may be forced to be free. Hobbes clearly says that the ancient freedom was the freedom of the collective; it wasn’t the freedom of the individual. “ So far, this all, in many ways, is very abstract and Rousseau deliberately sets out his plan for the general will in a highly abstract and semi-technical language. But he turns to questions particularly in Book III about how is the general will actually applied. In the first place, the general will can only operate in small states, much like the size of an ancient republic. The modern nation-state, as we have come to think of it, is far too large and diffuse to determine the general will. Finally, or in addition, such a state where the general will is operative would be one that would have to, in some sense, eschew the temptations of commerce and luxury for these bring with them, again, large scale inequalities. In many ways, in Book III, Rousseau seems to indicate or to introduce a very, very almost un-Rousseauian emphasis on prudence, moderation, flexibility that seems at odds with the dogmatic claims of the first two books with its emphasis upon the absolute inviolability of sovereignty. The writings of Rousseau had this powerful influence on the idea of creating a new people and a new nation. It might be better understood as an artist or a visionary."
839,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-21,"With the emergence of democracies in Europe and the New World at the beginning of the nineteenth century, political philosophers began to re-evaluate the relationship between freedom and equality. Tocqueville, in particular, saw the creation of new forms of social power that presented threats to human liberty. His most famous work, Democracy in America, was written for his French countrymen who were still devoted to the restoration of the monarchy and whom Tocqueville wanted to convince that the democratic social revolution he had witnessed in America was equally representative of France’s future.Alexis de Tocqueville, , trans. Henry ReeveElectronic edition deposited and marked-up by ASGRP, the  at the University of Virginia, June 1, 1997","I want to begin by talking a little about what is the question or what is the problem to which this immense book of which you’re reading, I don’t know, a couple of hundred pages maximum–What is the problem with which this huge book is concerned? So the problem of politics, you might say, in age of democracy, is the problem of how to control the sovereignty of the people. But before going on, let me ask, who was Alexis de Tocqueville? Tocqueville and his wife had no children. Tocqueville studied law in Paris and during this time he made the acquaintance and friendship of another young aristocrat by the name of Gustave de Beaumont. Now, if you do the math, when you consider that he was 30 years old in 1835 when the book’s first volume was published and he said he was speculating on these things already 10 years before, it would seem that the germ of the idea for the book, the germ idea, the germ cell for the book, had occurred to Tocqueville when he was only 20 years old, that is to say about the age that most of you are here. Nevertheless, the second point I would make about that letter is that it is also clear that Tocqueville was writing his book not for the benefit of Americans, who you will discover he thought had little taste for philosophy, but for Frenchmen. What is not certain, you could say, is what form democracy will take. I think those who want to regard it, namely his book, who want to regard it closely will find in the entire work a mother thought that, so to speak, links all the parts, a mother thought. Note, in the first instance, that Tocqueville speaks of equality as a social condition, an equality of conditions, not a form of government . The historical process, at least as Tocqueville traces it out here, has been a process of gradual equalization of social conditions. What form it will take elsewhere or it may take elsewhere is by no means predetermined. It is a matter for statecraft and leadership and political thought. The first and, in many respects, most fundamental feature of American democracy is the importance that Tocqueville attributes to local government and local institutions, the importance of localism, local democracies, and you might say, the spirit that emanates from it is the spirit–is the key to the whole. Yet, in some ways, Rousseau–Tocqueville combines Rousseau–his reading of the township, his Rousseauian reading of the township, with a kind of Aristotelian twist. The township exists by nature but its existence is far from being guaranteed."
840,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-22,"Three main features that Tocqueville regarded as central to American democracy are discussed: the importance of local government, the concept of “civil association,” and “the spirit of religion.” The book is not simply a celebration of the democratic experience in America; Tocqueville is deeply worried about the potential of a democratic tyranny.Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America, trans. Henry ReeveElectronic edition deposited and marked-up by ASGRP, the  at the University of Virginia, June 1, 1997","Last time, I believe I said I wanted to discuss three features that Tocqueville regarded as central to American democracy. But the second, and probably the aspect of Tocqueville’s account of democratic America that has received the most attention at least recently, is the aspect of what he calls throughout the book “civil association,” civic association. It is what one might think of as intermediary groups, voluntary groups, civic organizations of all kinds that Tocqueville is immensely impressed with and which he turns into one of the central pillars of the democratic experience. He writes that, “in democratic countries,” one of the most famous sentences from the book, “In democratic countries, the science of association,” he says, “is the mother science. It is something that requires a certain kind of culture and is a learned activity. They are very, very concerned with getting into the finals, into the bowling tournament. Obviously, it goes to show that civic association alone is not enough to create democratic citizens. Tocqueville often writes, and I would say this is the dominant tone of his writing on religion. Maybe you’ll have a chance to talk about this in your section. As he said in that letter to Louis de Kergolay that I mentioned last time, his other two great sources of inspiration were Montesquieu and a seventeenth-century French philosopher named Blaise Pascal. Too often, way too often we read  as it if were simply a celebration of the democratic experience in America. Tocqueville, among other things, is deeply worried about the potential, I mentioned briefly about this last time, the potential of a democratic tyranny. Although Tocqueville devotes a great deal of attention in Volume 1– we’re not really reading these sections, I don’t think they’re all that important for our purposes–he spends a great deal of attention simply sort of describing the makeup of the federal constitution, the structure of the Houses of government and so on. Napoleon was in France, the man capable of mobilizing the masses into fits of patriotic zeal and to carry on war. It has to do with the way in which the empire–again, I’ll use his term– the empire of the majority makes itself felt in the realm of thought and opinion, the influence of the majority over thought. In fact, he becomes far more pessimistic about this."
841,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-23,"Professor Smith discusses the moral and psychological components of the democratic state in the context of Tocqueville’s Democracy in America. He goes on to explore the institutional development of the democratic state, the qualities of the democratic individual, and the psychological determinants of the democratic character. The ethic of self-interest is addressed, understood as an antidote to an ethic of fame and glory. Finally, Tocqueville is presented as a political educator and his views on the role of statesmen in a democratic age are expounded.Alexis de Tocqueville, , trans. Henry ReeveElectronic edition deposited and marked-up by ASGRP, the  at the University of Virginia, June 1, 1997","Well, today I’m going to finish Tocqueville or, to put it a different way, I’m going to say what I can about Tocqueville in 50 minutes, which is hardly finishing him. In describing these character traits, Tocqueville is providing us with a kind of moral phenomenology, and excuse please a rather pretentious term, kind of moral phenomenology of democratic life, one in which we are invited to look and ask whether we see ourselves in this description and whether we like what it is we see. The first of these features that I want to focus on, the most important moral effect in some respects the democracy has had on its citizen, is for Tocqueville the constant tendency to make us gentler towards one another. The moral imagination, so called, of the democratic citizen, is able to transport itself into the positions of others more easily than individuals living in aristocratic times. In many ways, Tocqueville brings to his analysis of democratic restiveness–you can see in it something of the aristocrat’s disdain for the acquisition of you might say mere material goods for which most of us have to work so hard to acquire. Tocqueville writes here, it seems, with a kind of disdain for a life understood as a constant and, in his view, self-defeating pursuit of happiness. I would ask you in this context if you have some time to read Darrin McMahon’s wonderful new book on  to give you a little bit of an indication of the way this term has been used throughout its history and the way in which in many ways the obligation to pursue happiness, to restiveness, that kind of restiveness, is the source of so much, as he puts it, singular–the singular melancholy, he says, that the inhabitants of democratic lands often display amid their abundance. And finally, the third feature of democratic psychology that I want to focus on is this idea of self-interest or self-interest well understood as Tocqueville calls it. In contrast, in other words, to the aristocratic concern with fame and honor, interest was regarded–self-interest was regarded as a relatively peaceful or harmless disposition leading us to cooperate with one another for the sake of common ends. This was the official doctrine of the time in matters of morality, speaking of aristocratic ages. He is not saying that all behavior is self-interested. And in many ways, these are two conflicting motives of human behavior. Again, these may not be heroic or extraordinary qualities but they do have the virtue of being within the range of everyone. Let me try to explain what I mean by that. This is, to use a term that modern political scientists often use to describe this, it is an argument from what is often called path dependency, that we are again deeply embedded within historical processes, tendencies, paths of development that we can do little to resist or control. Look at the chapter, and I can’t recall offhand the exact number of the chapter, but the one called “On Historians,” on the role of historians in democratic and aristocratic times, and how he shows us that in aristocratic ages–he’s thinking particularly of the ancient world–historians attributed to extraordinary individuals all the power to affect nations and change nations but in democratic times, in modern times, we tend to think of historians, one might also take his term “historian” to include social science as well. We tend to project systems which deny the power, the unique power of the individual. Tocqueville provides us living in a democratic age with the language to shape the future of democratic societies."
842,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-24,"This final lecture of the course is given “in defense of politics.” First, the idea and definition of “politics” and the “political” are discussed with reference to the ideas of Immanuel Kant and twentieth-century political scientists, novelists, and philosophers such as Bernard Crick, E. M. Forster, and Carl Schmitt. Patriotism, nationalism, and cosmopolitanism are also addressed as integral parts of political life. Finally, the role of educators–and “old books”–is discussed as essential to developing a proper understanding of the political.","Anyway, today, the last class, I had on the syllabus, I think it was called globalization and political theory or something to that effect and I guess since writing that I’ve changed the theme of this final lecture a bit and I want to talk about defending politics or in defense of politics. But Forster, in some respect, has given us, I would suggest, a false dilemma. Loyalty is a moral habit just as betrayal is a moral vice. Rather, people who betray others in one area of life are likely to do so as well in others. It is a matter of finding a balance, the proper balance, between extremes. Schmitt’s view is rooted, I believe, in a very important human truth, namely, the world is a dangerous, in fact, very dangerous place, like in many ways Hobbes or Machiavelli, Schmitt takes the extreme situation, that is to say, the situation of war and mobilization for war, and turns it into the norm, turns it into the normal situation. Why is war something that takes place exclusively between states rather than within them, as the logic of bitter rivalry and competition and friend and enemy cuts all the way down, so to speak?The logic of Schmitt’s argument, at least as I understand it, points not only to war between states but ongoing civil war and civil conflicts within states, between rival groups expressing their own desire for power and their own loyalty to their individual groups. The result of this logic of conflict, it seems to me, would be the negation of politics, that is to say the destruction of the sovereign state as the locus of political power. International bodies like the United Nations have been notoriously ineffective in curbing or restraining the aggressive behavior of states and international courts of justice like that in the Hague have been highly selective in what they choose to condemn. There seems to be little room for reverence for the sacred, in the cosmopolitan ideal. Such an idea, I think, can only lead in the long run to moral decay, that is to say, to a kind of inability or unwillingness to dedicate one’s life to ideals, to the relatively few things that give life wholeness and meaning. So to consider our regime means in some ways to consider it in the light of these universal alternatives. In other words, far from suggesting a traditional form of communal morality, American politics, as Paine suggests there, requires a commitment to the highest, most universal moral principles. To read these books in the spirit in which they were written is to acquire an education in political responsibility."
843,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-2,"The lecture begins with an explanation of why Plato’s Apology is the best introductory text to the study of political philosophy. The focus remains on the Apology as a symbol for the violation of free expression, with Socrates justifying his way of life as a philosopher and defending the utility of philosophy for political life.Plato, , translated with an introduction by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts CollectionPlato, Crito, translated with an introduction by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","Today we start with Plato, Plato’s  of Socrates. No other work of which I am aware helps us better think through the conflict. His, in other words seems to be a highly personal, in many ways, highly individual quest for self perfection and not a doctrine about the value of freedom of speech in general. At the heart of the dialogue or at the heart of this speech rather is a quarrel, a quarrel with his accusers over the question, never stated directly perhaps, but over the question of who has the right to educate future citizens and statesmen of the city of Athens. I say fairly recent times until, you know, the American democracy. It is not merely Socrates who is on trial. Under Pericles, Athens had built the famous Acropolis. So, the charges brought against Socrates did not simply grow out of thin air. This quarrel is a staple of Plato’s dialogues, is a central theme, not only of the  in which Aristophanes and Socrates are actually shown at the same dinner table with one another. It is not story telling; it is conversational, it is argumentative, if you want to use the word he applies to it, it is dialectical. You hear strong and compelling stories but no arguments. The new Socratic citizen, let’s call him that for a moment, the new Socratic citizen may have some features in common with the older Homeric warrior. But, also in many ways symbolizing Socrates’, at least on the Aristophanes’ account, Socrates’s detachment from the things down here on earth, the things that concern his fellow citizens. But, this seems quite removed, doesn’t it, from the Socrates who is brought up on charges of corrupting the young and the impiety in the And here is where Socrates actually tells the story, very important in the course of this speech; he provides a kind of intellectual biography of an incident that occurred long before the trial and set him on a very different path. At a minimum, we would think the charge of impiety suggests disrespect of the gods. In short you might say a lack of civic piety or respect. You know, when you see the bumper sticker on the car “Question Authority,” this kind of rejection of ruling opinion. There is a necessary and inevitable tension between philosophy and belief, or to put it another way, between philosophy and the civic pieties that hold the city together."
844,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-3,"In the Apology, Socrates proposes a new kind of citizenship in opposition to the traditional one that was based on the poetic conception of Homer. Socrates’ is a philosophical citizenship, relying on one’s own powers of independent reason and judgment.

When he says that his way of life has been private, he means that he has pursued a policy of, let’s call it “the principled abstinence from public life.” He was ordered by the Thirty, the hated Tyranny of the Thirty, he was ordered to assist in the arrest of a man known as Leon of Salamis, an arrest that would have and did in fact lead to Leon’s execution and Socrates tells how he at considerable risk to himself refused to participate in the arrest of this man. How does Socrates answer these charges of, in a way being not just an abstainer but he kept putting his own private moral conscience or integrity over and above the law? Just so in fact the god seems to me to have set me upon the city as someone of this sort. Would it not seem that in order to rebut the charge of impiety that he would use or adopt a kind of religious language that would resonate with the jury and rebut the accusation, perhaps even suggesting that he is the truly religious and pious one and not the ones like Anytus and Meletus who are bringing charges against him?Socrates seems, or could be seen, to be speaking not just ironically but provocatively in describing himself as a gift of the god. In part, because I think the dialogue presents, as it were, the city’s case, the case of the city against Socrates, I mean to consider some of the following. The , on the other hand, is a conversation between Socrates and a single individual, only one person. So let’s look into the  just a little bit. The breaking of even a single law calls into question the authority of law as such. The citizen, he says, owes his very existence to the laws. He accepts entirely, or the laws force him to accept entirely, the covenant that every citizen has with the laws that binds them to absolute obedience. But it gets back to the question, are the reasons Socrates gives Crito for refusing to escape, the reasons he puts in the mouth of the laws of the city of Athens, are those Socrates’s true reasons?"
845,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-4,"Lecture 4 introduces Plato’s Republic and its many meanings in the context of moral psychology, justice, the power of poetry and myth, and metaphysics. The Republic is also discussed as a utopia, presenting an extreme vision of a polis–Kallipolis–Plato’s ideal city.Plato, , translated with an introduction by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","There is one person in here, I don’t know who it is, and you will not know who it is yet, but there is one person in here for whom the reading of Plato’s  will be the most important intellectual experience you have at Yale. The first and most obvious thing to say about the  is that it is a long book. The first five books that deal with and culminate in the best city, Plato’s ideal city, what he calls Kallipolis, the just city, the beautiful city, ruled by philosopher-kings. Such a city would require, so Socrates tells us throughout the opening books, the severe censorship of poetry and theology, the abolition of private property and the family, at least among the guardian class of the city, and the use of selected lies and myths, what would today probably be called ideology or propaganda, as tools of political rule. Plato, who Popper accuses in a passionate, albeit not very well written book, accuses Plato of being the first to establish a kind of totalitarian dictatorship. Is that true?Plato’s  is, we will discover as you read, a republic of a very special kind. It is always worthwhile to remember that Plato was, above all, a teacher. Almost immediately after the trial of Socrates, Plato left Athens and traveled extensively throughout the Greek world. The dominant feature of Plato’s political theory, David Grene, a great reader of Plato, has said is “the root and branch character of the change it advocates and existing institutions.” We don’t know precisely what Plato thought, but we are helped, at least, by a kind of intellectual autobiography that he wrote and that we still have, in what is conventionally referred to as The Seventh Letter. When I was a young man, I felt as yet many young men do. And what is more, they actually invited me at once to join them, as though politics and I were a fit match. We learn shortly afterwards that they have taken this descent to the Piraeus to view a festival, a kind of carnival. A kind of carnival, a , a Mardi Gras, where a festival is going on. But I think you can see the big themes of the book already very present in the opening scene of the dialogue. We will also see Thrasymachus, a cynical intellectual who rivals Socrates as an educator of future leaders and statesmen. There is, in the first set of dialogues, a distinct hierarchy of characters, you might say, who we see later on express those distinctive features of the soul and the city. Thrasymachus, a visiting sophist, seeks to teach and educate, anticipating what the  will call the rational soul, the rational part of the soul. Each of these figures, in many ways, prefigure the relatively superior natures of those who come later in the dialogue. At my old age, I can spend my time–” “When I was a young man, that’s all I did."
846,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-5,"The discussion of the Republic continues. An account is given of the various figures, their role in the dialogue and what they represent in the work overall. Socrates challenges Polemarchus’ argument on justice, questions the distinction between a friend and an enemy, and asserts his famous thesis that all virtues require knowledge and reflection at their basis.Plato, , translated with an introduction by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","And what I want to do is continue with the account of the various figures, various persons who populate, who inhabit this dialogue, and who they are, what they represent, and how they contribute to the argument and the structure of the work as a whole. Socrates seems to dissolve those bonds of familiarity, loyalty and attachment that we all have by saying to Polemarchus, “How do we know, how do we really know the distinction between friend and enemy?”But Polemarchus seems to believe that a city can survive only with a vivid sense of what it is. Of what we might say, what it stands for, and an equally vivid sense of what it is not, and who are its enemies. He is the Doctor Moriarty to Socrates’s Sherlock Holmes. The true ruler is the person who both acts on his own interest and of course knows what those interests are. Justice, in other words, for Thrasymachus is a kind of sucker’s game; obeying the rules that really benefit others largely because we fear the consequences of injustice. Justice is really something only respected by the weak who are fearful of the consequences of injustice. And so one can ask, “Is Thrasymachus wrong to believe this?” Thrasymachus is forced to admit that the just person is a fool, Thrasymachus believes, is a fool for obeying laws that are not beneficial to him. Thrasymachus himself seems to be embarrassed by his defense of the tyrannical life, of the unjust life. Certainly Socrates has not really proposed an alternative to Thrasymachus in his exchange with him; he has only, as it were, forced Thrasymachus to see that the logic of his ideas, the logic of his argument that justice is in the interest of the stronger, is a defense of tyranny, and is a defense of the unjust way of life. There is quite a bit of jousting between them that you need to be attentive too. Honesty is the best policy, we’ve heard Cephalus being concerned about returning to others what you owe as a way of pleasing the gods in the afterlife, and Adeimantus rightly takes this kind of argument to mean that justice is simply a virtue for the weak, the lame and the unadventurous, if you were only concerned with the consequences. The governance of the soul, Adeimantus’ standard of self-control, must be like the governance of a city in some decisive respects. That seems to be what Socrates is suggesting. The remainder of the  is, again, devoted to crafting the regime that will produce a distinctive kind of human character, and that of course is why the book is a utopia. The entire thrust of the book is devoted to the taming of spiritedness, and to the control of spiritedness. Sophocles will be expelled from the just city that Socrates wants to create. So on that I’m going to end today and next time we will talk about justice, the philosophers and Plato’s discovery of America."
847,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-6,"In this last session on the Republic, the emphasis is on the idea of self-control, as put forward by Adeimantus in his speech. Socrates asserts that the most powerful passion one needs to learn how to tame is what he calls thumos. Used to denote “spiritedness” and “desire,” it is associated with ambitions for public life that both virtuous statesmen as well as great tyrants may pursue. The lecture ends with the platonic idea of justice as harmony in the city and the soul.Plato, , translated with an introduction by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection",": Today I have the impossible task of finishing the parts of the  that I have assigned for the class. And again, recall this is the theme raised at the beginning of Book II by Adeimantus, who puts forward an idea of self-control, or what he calls self-guardianship as his goal. This is the quality that Socrates regards as being possessed by every great political leader and statesman, but it is also clearly a quality possessed by every tyrant. At the same time, he desired to see them. And I’m not going to speak about all of them, but I do want to speak a little bit about, because it has particular relevance for us, his proposals for the co-education of men and women that is a great part of his plan, especially related to the abolition of the family, that men and women be educated in the same way, right. A kind of version of recreational sex as a reward for a lifetime of self-control. But it is in this, and you can think about that, about whether that’s true or not, but it is in the same context of his treatment of men and women that something else often goes unnoticed and that is Socrates’s efforts to rewrite the laws of war, because of course the guardians are being trained and educated to be guards, to be warriors, to be members of a military class. Not only is expulsion from the ranks of the guardians penalty for cowardice, but Socrates suggests there should be, listen to this, “erotic rewards for those who excel in bravery.” Is the structure of a city identical to the structure of a soul? Let’s examine that problem from a slightly different point of view. But his question is still one that lingers and one that Plato includes for a purpose. He silences Adeimantus in some way as he silences Thrasymachus earlier; that is not always to say that their objections have been answered. And that leads, as it were, to the third and final wave of paradox of the Kallipolis which is the famous proposal for the philosopher-king. Unless the philosophers rule as kings or those now called kings, genuinely philosophize, there will be no rest from the ills for the cities, he says, right? But for now, what I want to do is talk about Plato’s democracy and ours. To be sure, Athenian democracy is not American democracy. And if money-makers in that one and there is neither order nor necessity in this life but calling this life sweet, free, and blessed, he follows it throughout. The first responsibility of the individual who wishes to engage in political reform is to reform themselves. This is a point that is often lost in the , that it is first of all a work on the reform of the soul. For some, philosophy represents a form of liberation from confusion, from unruly passions and prejudices, from incoherence."
848,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-7,"The lecture begins with an introduction of Aristotle’s life and works which constitute thematic treatises on virtually every topic, from biology to ethics to politics. Emphasis is placed on the Politics, in which Aristotle expounds his view on the naturalness of the city and his claim that man is a political animal by nature.Aristotle, , translated by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","I’ve always been told that any serious introduction to political philosophy has to start with a big piece of Plato. He was sent to Athens to study at The Academy, the first university, spoke about and established by Plato. Unlike Socrates, who famously in his image in Book VII of the , compared political life to a cave, and unlike the where Socrates tells his fellow citizens that their lives, because unexamined, are not worth living, Aristotle takes seriously the dignity of the city and showed the way that philosophy might be useful to citizens and statesmen. What did Aristotle think of these changes? ”For centuries, Aristotle’s authority seemed to go virtually unchallenged. He isn’t saying that man is political by nature. Note that he is not saying, although he is sometimes taken to be saying this, that he is not saying that there is some kind of biologically implanted desire or impulse that we have or share that leads us to engage in political life. Why does one lead to or entail the other? He’s not saying that it is because we are rational creatures possessed of the power of speech that causes us to engage in politics. But reason or  entails more than this capacity. It is speech that allows a sharing in these qualities that make us fully human. The alternative to the city, the empire, can only be ruled despotically. It follows, in one sense, that when Aristotle says that man is by nature a political animal and the city is by nature, the city can never be a universal state. The universal state will never allow for or does not allow for the kind of self-perfection that a small, self-governing  will have. A good citizen of a democracy will not be the good citizen of another kind of regime. But he says, “Others believe that the distinction between master and slave is not natural, but is based on force or coercion.” What is Aristotle doing in making this seem so complicated?At the same time, Aristotle agrees with those who defend the thesis of natural slavery. The natural hierarchy, then, seems to be a sort of hierarchy of intelligence or at least a hierarchy of the rational. Isn’t there a kind of egalitarianism, so to speak, built in to the conception of rational animal and political animal?He begins his , his great book the , with the famous opening statement, “All men have a desire to know.”"
849,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-8,"The lecture discusses Aristotle’s comparative politics with a special emphasis on the idea of the regime, as expressed in books III through VI in Politics. A regime, in the context of this major work, refers to both the formal enumeration of rights and duties within a community as well as to the distinctive customs, manners, moral dispositions and sentiments of that community. Aristotle asserts that it is precisely the regime that gives a people and a city their identity.Aristotle, , translated by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","Today, we’re going to study–I’m going to talk about Aristotle’s–you might call it Aristotle’s comparative politics and focusing on the idea of the regime. His answer is the regime; the regime is what gives a people and a city its identity. The matter, the substance, the material basis of a regime concerns its citizen body. The citizens who constitute a regime, he tells us, do more than occupy the common space but are held together, according to Aristotle, by bonds of common affection. It is affection, loyalty and friendship that make up a regime. But again, when Aristotle speaks of the kinds of affection that hold a citizen body together, he does not mean anything like the bonds of personal intimacy that characterize private friendships. Can a person be both, as it were, a good man, a good person and a good citizen? For a regime,” he writes, “is an arrangement in cities connected with offices, establishing the manner in which they have been distributed, what the authoritative element of the regime is, and what the end of the partnership is in each case, a similar but slightly different definition of what constitutes the formal structure of regime politics. In other words, every regime will be based on some kind of judgment of how power should be distributed to the one, to the few or the many to use the Aristotelian categories of political rule or some mixture of those three classes that constitute every city. Interestingly, we find Aristotle defending democracy on the grounds that it may contain collectively greater wisdom than a regime ruled by the one or the few. ”But then he goes on to say, “The stock of Greeks share in both, just as it holds,” he says, “the middle in terms of location. In the first place, it provides us with crucial information about Aristotle’s thinking about the relations of impulse and reason, of  and reason, as you might say the determinants of human behavior or the crucial pet term in that passage is this, again this platonic term spiritedness which is both a cause of the human desire to rule and at the same time a cause of our desire to resist the domination of others. Apparently, quality such as  and reason,  and deliberation, are not distributed equally and universally. He says, he distinguishes, between the people’s of the north, he calls them the Europeans, spirited and war-like but lacking ; those of Persia and Egypt containing highly developed forms of intellectual knowledge, no doubt thinking about the development of things like science and mathematics in Egypt but lacking this quality of  which is so important for self-government, for self-rule. These are, one might think about this, these things, he says, are at least in part determined by certain kinds of natural or geographic and climatic qualities. Every regime is in many ways a competition between classes. That all that ends in circumstances that justice, like the good citizen is, as it were, regime dependent?"
850,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-9,"This final lecture on Aristotle focuses on controlling conflict between factions. Polity as a mixture of the principles of oligarchy and democracy, is the regime that, according to Aristotle, can most successfully control factions and avoid dominance by either extreme. Professor Smith asserts that the idea of the polity anticipates Madison’s call for a government in which powers are separated and kept in check and balance, avoiding therefore the extremes of both tyranny and civil war.Aristotle, , translated by Benjamin JowettCourtesy of the University of Adelaide Library Electronic Texts Collection","I want to begin today with concluding Aristotle, part three. I say, it may simply be our prejudice that he didn’t. Wealth, property, he tells us, exists for the sake of virtue, not virtue for the sake of wealth. Again, a critique not only of Sparta, but also of Athens and its imperialistic ambitions. By philosophy, he seems to suggest not so much the capacity for abstract or speculative thought, but rather a kind of liberal education that he regards to be the preserve of what he calls by the term the , literally, the great-souled person or the great-souled man. He may occasionally hurt others, but this is not done out of deliberate cruelty. As if that weren’t enough, Aristotle tells us that the walks slowly, because to hurry is undignified, is tall and speaks with a deep voice. The gentleman may lack the speculative intelligence of a Socrates, but he will possess that quality of practical rationality, of practical judgment necessary for the administration of affairs. How is this quality of , of judgment, of practical wisdom, of horse sense, how is it acquired? Aristotle tells us that this kind of knowledge is a kind of knowledge most appropriate to politics. This kind of knowledge entails judgment and deliberation, the deliberative skill or the deliberative art. Already you could say to ask this question is to state a claim. To begin to answer this question, you might say even begin to think about it in the right way, requires that we stand back from Aristotle’s text for a while and ask some fundamental questions about it. What is the goal or purpose of the study of politics, and what is distinctive about Aristotle’s approach to the study of political things?Today, the term “political science” stands for one among a number of different disciplines that we call collectively the social sciences. What does Aristotle intend to do with it or want us to do with it? It implies a standard of better and worse and this implies some idea of the good by which we judge. This will be quite different, for example, from the qualities we will see beginning on Friday and next week that Machiavelli and later Hobbes or Locke, believe are necessary for the great founders or statesmen. Finally, the political scientist must know something about the techniques of reform and persuasion, what we might call the area of political rhetoric by which existing regimes can be brought closer to the best."
851,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-11,"Guest speaker Will Goetzmann, Director of the Yale International Center for Finance and professor at the Yale School of Management, provides a brief history of debt and financial crises. Professor Goetzmann begins with a discussion on debt slavery in the ancient world, and moves on to real estate financing in New York City. Professor Goetzmann also presents recent research by himself and others on the collapse of the real estate market. He explores the notion that the collapse of the mortgage market followed from the fallout of the larger financial crisis, rather than the other way around. Data on the real estate market is presented and discussed. Larger claims about responsibility of different players for the economic crisis are briefly assessed.","We’ve got a terrific guest today and I’m just going to briefly introduce him and then leave forty-eight minutes for you to enjoy what he has to say. I know you’ve been doing some reading about the current crisis and its relationship to ideas of capitalism and so forth. And New York would be the center of real estate trading. Well here’s a picture, just a piece of a bond of the kind they were going to trade. Nevertheless, you could see this stuff really take off and peak around 19 — late ’20s. The question is — so the one way to do this is to find some independent phenomena to observe. Other than taking a survey looking at multiple cities and how — when skyscrapers started to be built, and when this capital market developed, I don’t think I can really add anything else other — That’s good. So there are bonds that are still paying out. Jackie is studying to be a finance professor but she also worked in Wall Street for quite some time and knows a lot about these capital markets, particularly about mortgage data. Then we have some additional city level information we can compare that to, then we’ve got mortgage issuance by city, and finally, and this is pretty amazing, for one year for 2006 we took all the mortgages that were issued in the entire country and we have detailed data about those mortgages. They’re probably growing at less than 10% per year. Subprime approvals in 2006; the log of the dollar amount in thousands. It’s harder to say that they’re rational. Now here’s a whole — here are a whole bunch of these — the same exercise. The irony of these indexes is that although they opened a world to us of what housing prices do, they also made econometricians believe that they could estimate the risk associated with the housing. Suddenly, with this data, a little bit of information is a really dangerous thing when you put it in front of somebody that knows how to crank through a regression. I’ll just give you a little bit more flavor for what we do. So that we’re looking at this as sort of a equilibrium outcome where they’ve taken into account the potential for the capital constraints and what have you, so that negative coefficient actually — you see it here, this negative coefficient on approvals for prime versus subprime. My tone of voice may have led you to believe that I thought that was a foolish thing. On the same slide you also implied that the supply side, the bankers, were not accepting these overleveraged mortgage applications as much as you would expect, but does your research indicate anything about how overleveraged the banks were themselves in how much capital they were taking out of the market? We just didn’t — we didn’t pay attention to all of that."
852,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-12,"Professor Rae explores the creation of incentives and disincentives for individual action. The discussion begins with the Coase Theorem, which outlines three conditions for efficient transactions: 1) clear entitlements to property, 2) transparency, and 3) low transaction costs. Professor Rae then tells the story of a whaling law case from 1881 to highlight the power of incentives and property rights. The conversation then moves to Hernando de Soto’s portrayal of the development of property rights in the American West, and then shifts to a discussion of New Haven deeds, property values, and valuation of real estate. The lecture concludes with a discussion of Mory’s.","People will trickle in for the next twenty minutes, but let’s get on with our work. The theorem is a good thing to have in the background. Ray, how does it — does your friend here have any rights or not? Yeah, the Rolex is a mechanical movement of brilliantly designed and executed mechanical movement, and it’s not as good as an ordinary electronic watch; doesn’t keep time as well, and yet people are willing to pay thousand to one multiples for the social meaning of the brand. And Rich gets all the — or whoever finds the whale’s body two days later gets all the profit, why harpoon them? The gist is that they are loaded with dead capital. Well it’s not alive to me because I don’t own it but to the university maybe it’s alive. The — de Soto’s idea is that in an informal system of property which has not been integrated with a governmental system of property, people have capital, but it is dead in the sense that it can’t be used for collateral against a loan, and if it is sold, there is no way to enforce the contract on the sale except mafia style, and mafia style often doesn’t work out all that well. The chapter we read for today is about the proposition that the advanced economies didn’t get to having live capital all at once. It came through a long process, and de Soto, in this chapter, talks through the informal practices of property which grew up in mining camps in California, in agricultural communities in Iowa and other Midwestern states, in claims to land in colonial America. Let’s look at three properties first and then we’ll look at some more and we’ll see how structures of ownership get built around the formalized property parcels; 61 High Street is this building. Chapel Investments, LLC is owned by people I know, the Warrick family, and they own four parcels over there, including the one in which Caesar Pelli has his architectural office and so on, and it is organized as a taxable corp — a taxable LLC which is — this is a hybrid form which we’ll get to at the end of the hour. Might buying this have any resemblance to buying a Movado watch of this description? Yeah I might name it Rae College at Yale. You’re going to have to start paying taxes on it? Well I got to tell you I think that’s a really bad idea. If you study the current economics of movie theatres, don’t do it. The buildings were in disrepair, they were being used for very marginal purposes, and he bought the whole thing up for not very much and began renovating it. Analyzing what gets built on this framework is a little complex."
853,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-13,"Professor Rae discusses the subprime mortgage crisis. Major actors are presented and analyzed, including homebuyers, brokers, appraisers, lenders, i-banks, and rating and government agencies. Major actors’ incentives and risks are assessed. Professor Rae also presents a brief history of government involvement in mortgage markets. Deregulation of the industry and its consequences are explored, and Professor Rae facilitates a discussion on apportioning blame for the collapse of the U.S. housing market.","What I’d like to do this morning is spend eight or ten minutes with a few slides that are framing and background to the case. It is possible that it is now 1931 and another dip is out there. The chart is also interesting because Cleveland is this line. This is the same story shown in year-on-year percentage change and it actually doesn’t add much to our knowledge, I’m going to skip it. And it was — it is in that respect, I hope I’ve got — I’ve missed a chart here. Mark Kellogg submitted fraudulent data for about seventy homes, and — or somehow ended up, I’m not sure of the process of flipping a house exactly, but he did it to seventy homes and they all ended up defaulting on the loans, the people that he sold it to. Need an evaluation of the house, like, what the house value is. And it’s not altogether false that whoever hires — think about the incentives. The two streets together leased for one million dollars for ninety-nine years. And part — were you about to say something?: If you have a higher rating then that means you can get a lower cost of capital. I’m not selling you coffee or a substance that looks like coffee; I’m selling you coffee. And where there is a huge information asymmetry, we invent things like Moody’s or appraisals of real estate as a substitute, a way of creating or simulating information symmetry. To say something, you could go, “I’m not a big fan of their performance in this case,” but in terms of Moody’s & Fitch and everything, the collusion doesn’t — there doesn’t have to be explicit collusion in the sense that, if I give you this bond to rate, I will never rate a bond again unless you give me a Triple A rating. If you look at the data, and you have Mark Kellogg’s purchase list there, if you look at the data, you begin to notice not only is there a pattern in who the appraiser is, but there are patterns as to who the buyer is. So, rationally, each player is acting in their own best interests but, in the end, the big picture ends up where it hurts the system as a whole. And we’ll do a — I’d like to do two things with Monday."
854,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-14,"Professor Rae uses the Merck-Vioxx business case to highlight political elements of U.S. capitalism, including government regulatory agencies, federalism, lobbying, regulatory capture, tort law and liability, and patent law. Professor Rae discusses the importance and influence of concentrated business interests in Washington DC. The Merck legal battles underline how important political and judicial details are in the operation of capitalism. The case also shows the constraints that reform-minded politicians face in attempting to change the status quo.","Okay, so heretofore in this course we have treated government as one of two things: either, as in de Soto’s frame of reference, a guarantor of property rights; or as just background material, as with Smith, where the gravamen of  and the invisible hand story is to encourage governments to allow free markets and free trade. Almost every one of them is wildly unstable. The only contingency in which one would fear for the American republic, and there are people —  columnist Frank Rich, for example columnist David Brooks for another example, who fear that we’ve come to that difficult position, and that position is this: if the existing status quo is unsustainable, as one might have thought the status quo on the regulation of banking and mortgages was six months or a year ago, and as some argue the healthcare system is now, then all the checks and balances which make change difficult may make it impossible to escape from that very difficult status quo. There are exceptions to that but not a lot. The committee may not even hold hearings. By this we mean that if you are in the airline business, let us say, and there is a Civil Aeronautics Bureau, which is assigned the task of regulating your industry, if your industry can make an alliance with that agency itself, can capture the agency, that can be worth an enormous economic sum because it will allow you to structure public policy in a way which suits the combined interests of your industry. Something of the same is said to be at play, and almost certainly is at play, in the relationship between the pharmaceutical interest and the FDA. They ended up having to buy their property back on loans from Wall Street. Merck has had two really famous CEOs in recent time. Yeah, the river blindness drug is one where he — the government wouldn’t pay to distribute the drug in Africa, but he just had Merck pay, and thinks he got his money back in the motivation of his research staff. Well from the point of view of business, punitive damages are very scary. I’ll give you one more common law case to get the feel of this. Maybe a third; how many of them are D and F? Merck didn’t hire a world-renowned chemist, or even a nationally known chemist. They changed directions from the Vagelos days, Dr. Vagelos days, and they hired an MBA which I have a lot of respect for MBA’s, but I think we need to put into context what it was speaking to within the Merck culture. It was an — I put the Harvard Business School slide up to put a visual image to go with the intellectual concept that Merck was choosing to be a business first company not a patient — “When we tried the Ernst case, I was stunned at the opening that Merck gave."
855,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-15,"Professor Rae discusses the rise of mass affluence, the joint stock corporation, and advertising/consumer culture in America. Gregory Clark’s theory of the causes of the Industrial Revolution, including England’s “downward social mobility” in the medieval and early modern periods, are explored. According to this theory, the upper classes produced children in greater numbers than in other countries, and there were fewer jobs of high social status. This led to upper-class children working in “lower-class” jobs, infusing lower economic strata with upper class outlooks toward work. Clark also touches on a genetic, Darwinian explanation for England’s Industrial Revolution. Professor Rae also discusses other causal explanations for the Industrial revolution, including exogenous and endogenous growth theories, institutions, and Schumpeter’s theory of creative destruction. The wealth-generating power of the joint stock corporation is also presented.","Okay, today the coming of mass affluence to the advanced economies, principally the economies of the west. Now before I go further some of you are thinking green thoughts. None of them volunteer to become poor, and there is something that money buys that people want, and we’ll return to that from time to time. Well it could be more of a bell curve situation, if you know what I mean. The Vineland Institute published data showing that all the immigrant groups streaming into the U.S. in the early twentieth century were inferior to WASPS mentally, and they were very tough on the Jews. One of these ideas, which I think he’s right about, he doesn’t run with it very far, but the emergence of the nation’s state system, the rule of law, the existence of well formalized property rights, all that stuff is pretty powerful, and the western world was the initial focal point of the Westphalian nation state system. That by itself is a — is I think without question a powerful element in the story wherever a nation state society has gone from poor to rich. The idea would be that change occurs in the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 here where there’s a process of climbing to the right as we go to more capital-intensive production, more capital per worker, and then while Tal is doing that, Jennifer is saying, “Well no, we should reorganize this entirely. These slides — I’m going to show a series of proprietary slides constructed by Ibbotson Associates. You and I wouldn’t quite have the same tax privilege Yale has, and the most striking thing there is — what’s the most striking thing about that chart? It’s not anywhere near the sexiest or the fastest way, but it is one of the most solid ways, and the only conclusion I want to get out of this is that in talking about economic takeoff and the sustained growth in mass affluence, companies, joint stock companies with limited liability, are a big part of that. Well the joint stock corporation was, from its birth, really good at selling. We’re not just going to make soap; we’re going to sell soap. When my grandfather died and I was seventeen, I inherited a Mercury from him, it lasted one year before I crashed it. “"
856,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-16,"Professor Rae explores Hernando de Soto’s theories of dead and live capital and the power of property rights. According to de Soto, informal property must carefully be integrated into the formal property system. Professor Rae presents the example of Baltimore’s row house vacancy problem, and the difficulties in designing and implementing innovative property policies when existing interests of local stakeholders are firmly entrenched. The Coase theorem and transaction costs are revisited. Professor Rae also facilitates a discussion with students on how a developing country should most productively invest 5% of its gross domestic product (GDP). Complexities of economic development are explored.","Today what I’d like to do is focus first on de Soto, and then on the larger question — you have your informal property back, Jennifer — and then on the larger question of what’s the point of all this? The subject for today and for next Monday bring that out, that is, today with de Soto and I’m going to call on several of you to think about how you would use 5% of the GDP of a country to do as much good as possible, and then on Monday, , which illustrates, quite powerfully, that increasing the average income or wealth in a country can be a wonderful thing, but seen from the very bottom cannot be so great. Okay, so the photograph in front of you is meant to call forth de Soto’s idea of Braudel’s bell jar, and the foreground, a vast  is all informal property, and because it’s informal property it is dead capital, and the background is not only live capital and formal property, but extremely dense piling up of live capital. But at the top of the page he has a bridge showing his prescription for the path from dead capital on the left to live capital on the right. Right angles and straight lines have a brilliant history in American property law. I didn’t even know de Soto’s work at this time, but I was acting on the same general intuitions that he has; that we’re at the edge of the bell jar — this slide’s just in the wrong place, but the red line is the edge of the bell jar. It didn’t involve any actual water or construction; it’s just a photographic joke. These people live in perfectly good houses where they are,” and the ultimate effect is to drive the transaction costs through the ceiling. Because I think that having human capital can increase your investment on everything else, but without that, you’re not going to have the people that you need to build roads, or expand property rights or all these other things that de Soto talks about. Well-educated teachers I think would be better. Okay, so for education to be effective we have to have a next step. You can’t just start off with, here’s the school and we’re going to educate people and they’re going to keep all the value within society, they’re going to capitalize on it, there’s not an incentive based to really do that. Okay, but what I’m driving at is that you would want to look at what’s already happening the right way. Who would start us with an entirely different starting point, yes? It’s little things like that, but I don’t know how you would — like where you would even begin to invest to make those things more efficient, but I think the foreign direct investment and the competitive advantage flow from that."
857,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-17,"Professor Rae discusses Aravind Adiga’s novel . The novel reveals the difficulties developing countries face dismantling entrenched inequalities. Corruption and chronic rent-seeking behavior can be major obstacles. Other aspects of the novel, including India’s religious history, the role of caste structure, and entrepreneurialism, are also explored. Links are made between themes from the novel and previous class discussions on the nature of capitalism.","Well, this is what a well-worn copy of looks like. It has many ways to look at it, it is written in a very straightforward style that is — each paragraph is pretty straightforward. Again and again the concept of the darkness comes up in the book; help us to try to understand that. From the point of view of village India, deep in the darkness, is it clear one way or the other whether the economic — miracle may be too strong a word, but the incredible progress in overall development that’s been made since about 1990, is a good thing or a bad thing? Who represent people — can you help us with it? I think it’s a fairly major issue because even when you make the transition into the lightness in the book, you still get severe corruption of course with — you know the — Balram’s boss going to give the big bags of money to the government. So I think it’s corruption that pervades every level, and kind of the light is a little bit of a deceptive name for what Balram was into because even at the height of his success the only way he can succeed is by killing someone and then by paying off the policeman. He gave me an incredible perspective on caste and most people don’t actually know about that; I didn’t know about it and I’m going to go a little bit into the history of caste, because it’s — it’s honestly fascinating. Caste — a caste wasn’t a bad thing when it first started. For example, we have blacksmiths and we had traders, and we had people on different sectors of the economy here. Similarly we had castes in India, and they weren’t, sadly, constraining, they were just indicating what you are best at, its division of labor. And in the American system for example, you at least have the hope and the ability to move from caste — from trade to trade, from caste to caste, and I think that’s a trend that’s going to be reversed. Okay, so he’s in two different coercive networks, one to do with his own family and another to do with the family which employs him. Well there’s — I had another — I asked somebody about English language, who did I ask? Caste, he is not from an advantaged caste."
858,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-18,"Professor Rae teaches the SELCO business case, about a distributed electric power generation scheme targeting rural Indians. In presenting the case, Professor Rae discusses several analytical frameworks for thinking through business cases, including SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats), and the Porter Forces. Issues with SELCO’s business model are discussed, including the scalability of their operations, and capacity to break into higher margin markets. SELCO’s financing structure and partnership with a local microfinance institution are also explored. Students offer suggestions about how to improve SELCO’s business.","Today’s case, SELCO SEWA, is a wonderful transition to Collier’s  and a — I want to start with some frameworks and I’m going to do these briefly. Buyers; if buyers have a lot of leverage, or as in the SELCO case, not a lot of money, then buyers become a central point of strategic focus. Again, left to right, and if you think about the SELCO case — where’s their main focus on this arrow at SELCO? The classic insight on — classic example on this is on McCormick farm machinery in the 1800s. Why would people, once the grid came — switch from SELCO’s equipment to grid equipment? I think ultimately they don’t want to be a bottom line company, that their mission is not purely financial. Adam Smith distinguishes between total demand and what he called effective demand. Now is that — somebody defend SELCO please. I mean I guess this goes back to the bottom line we talked about, and whereas SELCO and SEWA, it’s not just a for profit bottom line; they really want to help people, and that comes up a lot in the case, wherein they thought that what the name of the manager of SELCO is that he really wanted to help these people. Okay, so there is a sort of multiplier effect when on the commercial side of this you customize it correctly. Now a background fact about them which isn’t in the case is this: I had lunch today with a Yale College alum who worked last year for an India company that manufactures equipment like this, GWP, and GWP assigned her the task of finding a sales relationship with SELCO, so she spent a year working with SELCO trying to sell them a high quality, but completely standardized system that was designed to achieve scale economies. I think it means that SELCO is a service company and is destined to remain a very small one. Well I actually don’t think they’re going to get there. I just figure out a couple of SELCO’s products, a couple of their best products that numerically meet the needs of the most number of people, and then I would expand by pushing those products and of course in the process you would lose out on customization and individual solutions, but if your goal is to provide illumination to the maximum number of people just kind of focus on what you’re good at and skip that — Focus on a few products, sounds like a good idea. I’m sympathetic to that view but I’ll set up some critical screens to pass it through and explain those, and you’ll see that video at the beginning of class on Monday and then after my little video there is a Ted talk by Paul Collier explaining what he thinks his book has to offer."
859,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-19,"In a pre-recorded lecture, Professor Rae discusses problems with using gross domestic product (GDP) as a measure for societal well-being. For example, GDP fails to capture wealth inequality and socially undesirable conditions that can increase GDP. He then touches on some of the “traps” presented in Paul Collier’s book,  that are keeping the poorest of the developing countries mired in poverty. In the second half of lecture, a video of Paul Collier is shown in which the author urges the developed world to take as a model America’s reconstruction package to post-WWII Europe. According to Collier, the developed world must rethink its aid and trade policies toward the developing world. Collier also discusses the relationship between democracy and the so-called “resource curse,” and how the rich world can create institutions to support reformers in the poorest countries.","Okay, so today Professor Rae is not going to be here and so we’re going to watch two videos instead, one of him and second one is of Paul Collier talking a little bit about his book, but also about recent research that he’s done, especially on governments and commodities. The gross domestic product is at once too broad and too narrow, as a measure of value generated by the economy. Finally, to get just how mechanical this measure is, if for any reason we were prepared, the government say, was prepared to pay people to dig holes and then fill them back up with the same dirt and pay them a salary for that, we would have increased GDP. There are others ways in which it is not inclusive enough. So one thing to do is just tinker with the measure. Now as a sidebar let me just mention John Rawls, who published in 1971 a classic book, a book that will be read hundreds of years from now, I imagine, called , and Rawls asked people to imagine that they were behind what he called a veil of ignorance, and the idea of the veil of ignorance is roughly that you have no idea who you are. His idea, stated way too simply, is that you should maximize the welfare of the least advantaged group in society. Trap one may be, be a colonial site, and be set back by it. Not much news in that but it’s actually very important because if you think about the logic of capital development–capitalist development, and you take either the Coase Theorem or de Soto’s development of the Coase Theorem seriously, which I do and I urge you to, it’s built on the foundation of the Westphalia nation state system, which came into being in the middle of the seventeenth century. So what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion? Again, I looked at that, and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of goverannce, the initial level of economic governance when the resource booms accrue. They still go up in the short run, that’s what we see across in the bottom billion at the moment; the best growth rates they’ve had ever. The question is whether the short run will persist. It turns out that electoral competition is the thing that’s doing the damage with democracy, whereas strong checks and balances makes resource booms good. I can’t go through all of them, but I’ll give you an example."
860,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-1,"Professor Rae introduces the concept of capital as accumulated wealth used to produce more wealth. Questions about what constitutes capital are posed and discussed. The biggest story in recent economic history is the substitution of labor intensive production to capital intensive production. This transition, and the various speeds and scales with which it has occurred in different places at different times, has generated large income disparities around the world. Characteristics of capitalism are presented and discussed.","I’m going to use today to actually cover some introductory material. They are crop circles, and all of us who travel from east to west across the country have seen them, but we haven’t seen them quite in this density because this photograph is taken from space, it’s a NASA image, and it’s an extraordinarily elegant display of something very simple. Okay so what is the squirrel producing with that nut? The accumulated wealth is the energy and silk required to weave the nest or weave the web, and the web is indeed an instrument for the work of capturing prey, but there’s no external product beyond it, so even that is not quite what we have in mind. If you elicit information from me you’ve got to give me something back. I think seeds in any quantity can be capital because each — once you plant it and if there isn’t successful pollination — Is the voice loud enough here?: One characteristic feature of how capital works is combining different factors in the production of the same thing in an extremely intelligent way. The market price of highly productive loam soil in one of the three or four richest agricultural zones in the world is much higher than in the margin of the world’s largest desert. It looks like the problem here is real fragmentation. She goes on to say that we should try to capture the scale economies of big fields by consolidating agriculture. I just couldn’t resist throwing this one in, this is the Libyan Desert and center pivot agriculture plus maybe something else that uncles — observers from the sky found interesting. And at a given moment in time, are enormously consequential from a competitive point of view, because if you are not the low cost producer, the low cost producer is in a position where if she has sufficient scale of operation, she can drive you out of business. It is a method by which to steal the labor from the exploited masses. It is indeed a trademark of the way capitalism works. He is a much more complex thinker than we usually imagine him to be. by Hernando DeSoto is an argument about why the less developed countries in the world are less developed, and the gist of it is that formal and enforceable property rights are a precondition to capital development. Spinnaker became a public company and was extremely successful."
861,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-20,"Professor Rae begins by briefly discussing his recent trip to Washington, where he became more closely acquainted with the health care reform bill. Professor Rae uses this example to highlight the intimate connections between capitalist market systems and the government. Then, with the help of two guest speakers, Professor Rae discusses the dramatic downfall and planned revival of one of Yale’s most iconic institutions: Mory’s club. Various methods for increasing the club’s relevance to the contemporary Yale community are discussed, including reforming membership rules.","The dog ate my homework; you guys will understand what that means. I want to talk briefly about what I’ve been doing in Washington and how it relates to what we’ve been doing here. Before I get to that I want to talk a little about Washington. Okay, so he handed the thing to The House of Representatives, and the lobbying process became very intense, and it is an incredibly intricate set of, not — most of it — an awful lot of it is like the earmarks for a bridge in Alaska, but it’s usually not a bridge in Alaska, it is a podiatrist in an office spread all the way across the country. Would somebody like to recap what they think the last year or two of Mory’s existence looked like? The second thing I did after that was to get Jonathan to agree to work with us. I didn’t see any students there, there was no vibrancy, no relevance to the place, and so then I got involved because of these guys, and the whole concept of what Mory’s should be became crystallized in my thinking. I think if you do a survey among the graduate students, 85% to 90% of them won’t even — or never thought that they were eligible for membership to Mory’s. It is a business with an absolutely natural market all its own. They thought it was somehow — for all different reasons, but a third of our market just thought, “Can’t go there,” so that’s kind of an issue. Well partly because all those things are not very good, but partly because they don’t think they’re invited. Can you think of another market segment that you might want to pay attention to? This is a sales call; I’d like you to join the restaurant. I think you’re exactly right, but tell me how you got — what are you thinking? All right, well I would want to know what kind of food they serve, because if I have — if I’m a picky eater, maybe I wouldn’t even enjoy going there because I’m not twenty-one. Second, the subway alumni are a very important part of any university. Okay anybody who has ever given $100 to Yale, alumni or not, is clearly eligible. How about the membership roster of the Quinnipiac Club or The Graduate’s Club, or The New Haven Country Club, or any one of twenty other comparable clubs in the thirty mile circle? Aren’t you leaving out the all-important potential drinking business of the grad and professional students?We are, and I should point out to you that Jim Alexander, whom you all know well, not just from his Enron days, is, in eight days from now, assuming office as president of the Lawn Club, and I was talking about stealing his members sort of just to have fun with him."
862,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-21,"Guest speaker Paolo Zanonni, partner at Goldman Sachs, discusses the firm’s transition from a straight partnership to a hybrid partnership / joint stock corporation. The impetus for the transition was to obtain the advantages of the joint stock corporation, especially in raising permanent capital, while maintaining the beneficial incentive structure of a partnership. The partnership selection process, which fosters leadership, entrepreneurialism, and conformity to the firm’s corporate culture, has remained virtually unchanged since Goldman’s IPO. Mr. Zanonni describes the corporate culture and values of the firm as seen from the inside.","We’re very privileged today and Wednwesday to have my dear and good friend of thirty-five years standing, Paulo Zanonni, who has for quite a long time been a partner at Goldman Sachs, and is indeed the second most senior member of the Goldman Sachs partnership, by age. In 1978 to go to work for Johnny at Fiat? You can’t sell your partnership in Goldman. Whereas, with a corporation you have centralized management where the board appoints a chief executive and a chief executive, at least in theory, is responsible for appointing everyone else, and finally, how did the two do as media for raising capital? The mechanism for raising capital; back to Paolo. It was an ugly period, but compared with all its competitors, in this and in many other matters, Goldman has been absolutely tops, and part of the culture is not to — chest thumping is not the Goldman style. They have no buildings, most of the buildings are leased, they have no plant and equipment, they have no patents, it’s just a people’s business and so when you are running a people’s business one of your core competencies has got to be the ability of coordinating the behavior to those people 3,000/4,000/20,000 and Goldman has only been convinced that the partnership structure, it’s ideal to coordinate the behavior of the top echelon of the firm. Maybe too — So what you have — let me try to — what you have is that you have the legal form of a joint stock liability company imposed into an organization that, as organizational structure, and institutional government, except at the top, has maintained the same institution and the same type of leadership selection that you had in the partnership — let’s say partnership pre-IPO. Usually when you enter Goldman you are given a class, like you are given a class when you went to Yale, you are the class of 2007/2008. For someone that has done — that they have had normal career, it comes time to be considered. That search about the qualities of the various candidates. Of course when you look at an organization you have to think about the organization. For instance if you take a picture — we don’t give those details for many, many reasons, one of which is they change too often. An exceedingly smart person, who by the way happens to be a Yale graduate, saw the opportunity, saw the lack of capability, and decided to form a partnership with someone that knew a lot about real estate all over the United States and didn’t have any capital. There is a reasonable amount of smart of people. The partners work 70 or 80 hours per week until they retire; unless you are ready to do that, no way."
863,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-22,"Guest speaker Paolo Zanonni, partner at Goldman Sachs, explains a major deal in the European utilities market. Enel, a major European utility, attempted to totally transform its position by expanding into the Spanish market and acquiring the Spanish utility Endesa. The deal was exceedingly complex, and involved multiple European governments, intense regional politics, and a handful of enormous utility companies. The transaction shows the important links between politics and free-market operations.","We continue Monday’s look at Goldman Sachs and Goldman Sachs’ role in the world of financial capitalism, and as on Monday, we have my good friend Paolo Zanonni with us. Because for instance just to take a few, Armani is not, Prada is not, Dolce & Gabbana is not. I have less — unless you want to talk about trucks. The only case that I know of, of a reasonably large car company being shut down, is the old British . As far as the model of development that Spain has followed, especially in the last twenty to twenty-five years, is a model of development that is largely biased toward construction and real estate development, and so-and very entrepreneurial. First, you have a deal that makes perfect sense from the economic and financial point of view. And so they tried to stop it, as you can see from the statement, they tried to stop it making it difficult so the regulatory agency and just trying to fight it with all the weapons that they have. In a very sophisticated way, which is worse if the company that E.On is, they also start a sophisticated lobby with the European Commission because they believe that the main threat; it is not another bidder. In addition, they have all the resources. I think that it — I seem to remember that at that time E.On has cash on the balance sheet for about €100 billion — it’s going to cost about $40 or $42 billion?Again, they don’t go anywhere and they get stalled, at that point, Enel, that has been watching the situation, sees an opportunity. There is a bid by the leading European champion, a utility, that is a lot richer and can become a lot richer, but doesn’t go anywhere because the Spanish government is reluctant to sell or to have one of the utility — one of the national champions end up in German hands. What do you want?Oddly — naturally, now the entrepreneur says, “No, no, no the reason why I’m here is because I want to diversify my risk, I want significant opportunities to growth — to grow and so what I really want is not cash but is a piece of Endesa.” So this is a battle being fought with two fronts. I know but the rest is just the end of it. The change in — the change that the management wanted has occurred, but what happened is that because of the way that the management, and because of the circumstances, there is a huge load of debt on the company and it is true that they wanted to have a more risky company with a higher potential of goals, but investors are not very happy about having invested in a company in which the equity — the debt to equity ratio is 3:1, or 3.2:1.Enel thinks that a capital increase in order to — a dividend reduction and a capital increase."
864,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-23,"Professor Rae discusses the case TXU v. EDF, about an electric company private equity deal that involves environmental interest groups. Professor Rae structures the discussion by contrasting the deal as viewed from the perspective of Austin, TX and Washington, DC. Actors in both locations prioritize different aspects of the deal differently. The case highlights the importance of the “customer voter base,” and the role of public opinion toward both companies and their associated politicians. Professor Rae highlights how private companies can ally themselves with environmental groups to achieve mutually beneficial goals.","It occurred to me over the break that Goldman Sachs gets some bad press. Now it also reminds me of the passage in Richard Posner’s book, to the effect that we can no more blame the financiers for the wreckage of the credit markets than we could blame a lion for eating a zebra, and there’s an odd discontinuity here. Okay so my own intuition is that it wouldn’t do them a lot of good. It is on the expanded generation capacity that TXU has announced, and that expanded generation capacity is on the lower edge from an environmental point of view. You can artificially — you can buy carbon credits and reduce your emissions, like, technically on paper. If you’re building a new site it requires a lot more regulatory approval to a green field site I guess. You’ve already been through it, and if you can come back to people and say, “This is a less disruptive plant than the old one,” that’s a pretty good start, and even if people aren’t much taken by that, if you’ve been — if the management has been intelligent they will have built a network of local relationships, which they would have to build anew on a green field site. Is Perry a populist who wants to beat up on them? He never seems to be a jump ahead of you in the argument. If you can get media coverage of it, it tends to have a more dramatic effect on public opinion. Even by not — people on the investment side in organizations like this make three or four, or ten times that, but the general norm in non-profits is — how many — are there people here who plan to become non-profiteers? What’s GE’s long-term reputation for environmental pollution? For example, in Biomet, produce medical devices but where they sign onto the proposition that they will make their production process far greener than it was before, so that I as an investor can buy into the green fund, and expect market rates of return and think that on the side I’m doing a little bit of good for the environment."
865,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-24,"In this final lecture of the semester, Professor Rae gives a summary of major themes, thinkers, and cases covered in the course. He begins by reviewing some foundational ideas, including Adam Smith’s invisible hand, Marxist historicism, Malthusian economics, and Schumpeter’s notion of creative destruction. Professor Rae also reviews the importance to capitalism of the modern nation state, which guarantees property rights and contracts, and recalls Hernando de Soto’s theories about the importance of formal property rights for developing countries. Various forms of corporate structure and ownership are discussed. Professor Rae concludes by introducing a case about water privatization in Bolivia.","Okay so the object today is to wrap our arms around, not all but a good portion, of the material covered. Okay capital, capital is accumulated wealth reproductively deployed. Private businesses that, in their view, exploited labor, in their view despoiled the environment, in their view desanctified historical and religious tradition, and there is no inventor of capitalism. The withering away of the state takes awhile. And the upturn corresponds to the capitalist era. The state, property, and capital; back to Smith. There could be a state for women and a state for men, the geography of it would be a little tangled but they’re going to reproduce, but the gist of this is that capitalist wealth rests on the foundation of the nation state system and the nation state system is not altogether a pretty story. A practical story; have any of you ever been involved in a buying a house or being part of a family as it bought a house? So what Coase doesn’t say is that there is some particular symmetry or justice to the way property rights move, and indeed, it’s worth stopping to say that to ourselves. The vertically integrated corporation is also, from a public perception point of view, quite often a monster. Goldman Sachs is a different kettle of fish. He really is, I mean we’re really good friends, but I would say — I would say it to his face. The Ibbotson slides which I showed you some months ago, for the U.S., summarized what becomes of a dollar invested in 1927 as common stock and that kind of growth is characteristic only of very well managed equity investments. Got your attention, good; you ought to start by — I would start interpreting this story by asking yourself about Bolivia’s history in social composition and where it fits in the world economy."
866,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-2,"Professor Rae shows how countries over the last two centuries have experienced improved life expectancies and increased incomes per capita. Dynamic graphical representation of this trend reveals how improved life expectancies tend to predate increases in wealth. Malthus’ “iron law of wages” and diminishing returns are explained. Questions about why the industrial revolution occurred in England at the time that it did are then posed. Professor Rae then shows the importance of the “world demographic transition” to economic history and contemporary economics. All countries tend to follow similar demographic patterns over the course of their economic development. Countries tend to have high birth and death rates in Phase I, falling death rate and high birth rate in Phase II, falling birth rate to meet the death rate in Phase III, and low birth and death rates in Phase IV. These demographic patterns are associated with different levels of capital and labor. While all countries follow this demographic transition, they do so at different times, and world trade is a way of “arbitraging” between different stages in the world demographic transition.","I will begin by taking the snapshot you have in front you and than using the data animation on the board to give you a sense of the dynamic process, which is hidden in the static diagram before you. He flirts with the idea that the children of the wealthy were genetically superior to other children being born in early modern England and that that fact has something to do with why the great economic surge took place first in England; actually more broadly the United Kingdom. Generally movement toward the upper right hand corner. Okay, so there is something by and large good happening in the data. The general pattern, India is a good example, and the fiction work assigned for the course, , is about that vertical dimension and how exhilarating it is on the one hand, and the crushing disadvantage it imposes on people who aren’t part of the capitalist development story. Let’s get the scale of production to not be a linear flat line but get it do this. Let’s imagine this is actually a photograph of berry pickers in Poland in the year 1909, all the visual images here — or virtually all the visual images here comes from Wikipedia Common, and since we’re being filmed that’s important so that we don’t violate anyone’s copyright, because everything on Wikipedia Common is public domain. He combines this with something else so it’s hard to define, but if you decombine it, it’s almost as if there were a budget plane here, and you can move up and down the budget plane but not through it so that the total — it’s these dots moving away that could be explained Malthus-wise or St. Augustine-wise by assuming that there is a fixed total, and you can use it to feed more people worse, or fewer people better. Not in big ways, not in elegant ways, but there is something happening which takes us further and further from the central tenants of the Malthusian model. Clothing and bedding 10%, housing and heating, light and soap, not much. For example, money for heating your house and feeding the babies. It’s easy to make up a story, which Clarke does, to the effect that the energetic effort you might expect from those people who had been pushed down might increase the intensity of effort and competition in the economy. Now biology gone good; I’m going to tell this one in words and then give you the diagram. They’re having lots of babies and people are living long lives. People live long lives and the population of their societies becomes more or less static again. In the first phase we have death and birthrates somewhat unstable but steadily high."
867,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-3,"Professor Rae introduces Adam Smith’s notion of the “invisible hand” of the market. Several preconditions must be met for the invisible hand to work. Markets must be open, and there cannot be just one buyer or one seller who can control product prices. No producer can hold a pivotal private technology, and there must be more or less truthful information across the whole market. Governments must enforce property and contracts. However, many of these preconditions are at odds with the Porter Forces, which represent general rules of thumb, or principles, for a firm trying to make above average profits. These principles include avoiding direct competition, establishing high barriers to entry, and avoiding powerful buyers and powerful suppliers. Professor Rae suggests that submission to Adam Smith’s invisible hand may be contrary to basics of corporate strategy. Corporations can leverage powerful political influence to affect the movements of the “invisible hand.” Guest speaker Jim Alexander, formerly of Enron, discusses problems of very imperfect information, as well as the principal-agent problem. Professor Rae also discusses Adam Smith’s complicated ideas about self-interest and morality.","Since we are still in the shopping period and some turnover, I thought it might be good if I spent the first three or four minutes recapitulating from meeting one, and then a little more on meeting two, and then we’ll feather that into today’s topic, which is the great work of economics, and the great — the greatest and most thoughtful normative tract about markets and capitalism. And I asserted, and many of you agreed, that there’s something unambiguously good about that change, that the world is a better place because that change happened. And that these were, first of all, disruptive of the natural environment. Real wages are really quite low during Phase II and Phase III in the history of the country. One is that you get much higher incomes in Phase IV than in earlier phases. When no buyer is big enough to control the market. If you’re making — if you’re producing wheat or rice, and you say, “The world price is too low. There is no one who can be said to have set the price of the good or determined its quality. One of them is: You don’t want too much competition — direct competition. And the only way you can affect change in that type of market is to do what Adam Smith suggested, and that is make some sort of national security argument why — in fact, while Smith’s views are very well and fine in general, you need, and the country more especially needs, to have defense against foreign imports or ruinous competition. Well, let me come back to something else, and that is that at least one of the sections Smith has revolves around the butcher, the brewer, and the baker, and how it’s much more reliable to rely on their self interest than their benevolence, which is true. And he has a relatively unmarketable asset, which is his interest in his private butcher shop; very hard to sell, so he must count on long term profit maximization; not short term, but long term. Now let’s imagine that you had a — I don’t think (inaudible) processer is public at this point but let’s imagine that you had a butcher business which was owned by the public, controlled by a small group of managers. And yet, he led a life, which didn’t begin to maximize his own material interests. is the book, which made him famous in his own lifetime. How selfish, so ever, man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.” By 1851 he perfected what was called the Howe Pin Machine."
868,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-4,"Professor Rae relates Marxist theories of monopoly capitalism to Schumpeter’s theory of creative destruction. Both Marx and Schumpeter agree that capitalism is a system that is “incapable of standing still,” and is always revising (or revolutionizing) itself. Professor Rae critiques Marxist determinism and other features of Marx’s theories. To highlight Schumpeterian creative destruction, Professor Rae uses examples from technological revolutions in energy production since water-powered mills. Marx’s labor theory of value is discussed. Professor Rae highlights aspects overlooked by Marx, including supply and demand for labor, labor quality, and the role of capital in economic growth. Professor Rae also notes problems with Marx’s predictions, including the prediction that the revolution will occur in the most advanced capitalist economies. Professor Rae also discusses Marx’s theory of the universal class, the end of exploitation, and the withering away of the state.","Violating the syllabus, I’ve re-titled today’s discussion “From Marxist Historicism to Howard Head’s Tennis Racquet,” and let’s begin with Howard Head’s tennis racquet. But the point is that the revolutionary transformation of the means of production, and of what is produced and at what cost it sells, is very much on Marx’s mind. Now the many decades of experience we have lead us to be friendly critics toward the top of this story and unfriendly critics toward the bottom because the story told at the bottom is not only false, but dangerous. Monopoly capitalism — you’ll remember that when I was sitting with Jim Alexander last class talking about Adam Smith and the conditions under which the invisible hand remains invisible, I used the Porter Forces commonly used in MBA instruction to define the opposite of each of the conditions put forward by Smith, and so I’m using them again here. John D. Rockefeller who controlled — who came into control of oil all the way from exploration and the wellhead. My eldest daughter is a partner-level executive at Microsoft and in her house are Apple computers, which I have given her family. But the scale economies in that kind of business are enormously important. The chart begins with production based on water power; on mills based on falling water. It doesn’t matter how much, it’s not going to kill you. The disadvantage of direct current electricity is that as you put it through a long transmission wire, you lose most of it after the first five miles. How much do you have to pay for the commodity which he calls labor power or laboring powering? Good, because we did it a couple days ago, but I never know about turnover. And they did it, and did a very good job of it. The idea here is that with falling rates of capital and the immiseration of the working class, this system ceases to be stable. UK, Germany and the U.S. UK, Germany and the U.S. Those are not the places where the revolution happened. Francis Fukayama, who famously wrote a book called — that had the punch line: The end of history — after the Cold War ended — his view was that capitalist democracy became, “the end of history,” the unchangeable endpoint, and of course that’s not true. The guy who comes to center stage next time is F.A. Hayek, whose most famous book was called, , and who believed that a market society had within it the capacity for enormous creativity and growth, and we’ll examine that in class on Wednesday."
869,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-5,"A practical theory of freedom is discussed, based on Hayek’s Constitution of Liberty. Free societies can be thought of as great learning machines capable of aggregating individuals’ knowledge and accomplishments. Professor Rae uses examples from automotives and university administration to illustrate how freedom allows everybody to profit from others’ knowledge. Professor Rae also highlights Hayek’s story of the rock climber who is stuck at the bottom of the crevasse, and discusses whether refusing to assist another is an implicit act of coercion. Hayek’s theories of freedom are applied to modern cases of extreme poverty in developing countries. Professor Rae also discusses Yale University Press’ decision not to publish controversial cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed within a recent book. The lecture concludes with de Soto’s notions of live and dead capital, and the importance of property rights in unlocking the productive power of capitalism.","Okay, today’s discussion relies on three books, and one of them is Hayek’s , which you’ve seen two chapters of online. These are cartoons which make devout Muslims very mad. Hayek has in mind something very different from that, and the idea that society is in some sense a great learning machine, or that a free society is a great learning machine, is the powerful idea in Hayek’s work. The rate of accumulation grows in an exponential curve with a free society. The other side of that story, and here I’ve added a second axis on the right, which represents the percentage of a society’s knowledge which one very competent person can capture. I have no idea — I certainly can’t read these labels. The earliest alleged case was actually New Haven. If it doesn’t get to the right places that’s something to do with human agency or institutions. She didn’t supervise that; neither would I have been pleased if she had. People will say, we would like to own part of this. And capital will flow toward you, and so will competition. If you look closely at the way he defines coercion, you’ll find that the rock climber story is the clear and easy case, and by the end of our slides today, we’ll begin to look at some harder cases and some of those hard cases are raised by  book. Now this is more my kind of rock climber, hanging on barely. The way I would argue that with Hayek is that, conceptually, the concept of coercion is extraordinarily slippery. All I want you to do — what I really want you to do is get the power of Hayek’s idea in your heads and get the complexity of applying it in your heads. My reasoning would be similar to the reasoning back left, that freedom is freedom, and freedom includes bad taste. Richard Pestelli is correct that that represents a loss of something and a step on a slippery slope. It is a pragmatic judgment about how best to organize society. They don’t have formal documentation for them, so it is informal property."
870,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-6,"Professor Rae explains how the growing scale and complexity of railroads in the US were foundational to the development of modern capitalism. Operating the railroad system required professional managers and new management techniques, and the scale of railroad financing gave rise to the formation of the joint stock corporation. Professor Rae then discusses how different forms of company ownership differ along liability, liquidity, financial scalability, accountability, and role of ownership dimensions. Joint stock corporations are shown to be extremely efficient ways to raise large amounts of money, even if they suffer principal-agent problems.","It’s about the rise of the joint stock corporation. But when they get to be hundreds or even thousands of miles, the logistics of management get extremely challenging. In the nineteenth century train collisions occurred at rates varying from about 400 to 1,000 a year in the U.S., and they were often ugly, and they reflected the challenge of management. And that railroad had only about fifty employees. Characteristic of capitalism is that people are not content with small success. There were people who worried about railroad cars. One were railroad bonds where people in effect loaned money to the railroads and achieved a predictable income, relatively predictable income, from that investment in debt. Finally scalability; to what extent can we start with something small and grow something enormous? And the chain of accountability is the white line. Okay, and you take an active role in running the company? In a good law firm the real assets are the lawyers. Now in actual fact there are cases where stockholders rise up against management and throw the board out and with a new board throw the management out. Now we will — I’ll ask you before the term is over to have a look at a quarterly filing by a company so you get to see about what investors can see. Can I just send all of you a memo about Jim now being a partner? The corporation is designed for liquidity. You make sure that you have what’s viewed as a good lawyer helping you with that, a lawyer with a good reputation, make sure that you have audited financials by a firm of the highest reputation, and then eventually when the timing is right you go around the country for several weeks talking to prospective institutional investors because retail investors at most retail firms won’t buy with the smart money, which is deemed to be institutional, it’s not buying. As you can see here, nearly 90% of all the business done in the American economy is done by corporations so that the — an analysis of American capitalism or world capitalism which neglects the joint stock corporation neglects the most important player. You’ll find that she is a — she teaches the straight Harvard Business School technique and so we’ll all have fun watching that."
871,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-7,"Dean of the Yale School of Management, Sharon Oster, explains the CardioThoracic business case. Barriers to CardioThoracic’s success are discussed, including competition from other medical firms, “gatekeeper problems,” other medical procedures, and difficulties understanding needs of the firm’s customers. Various players in the case are identified, as well as their specific interests and potential strategies for articulating these interests. Dean Oster analyzes interest misalignments, information asymmetries, and discrepancies in values among the various players in the case.","All right we have here forth flown at a relatively high altitude with the likes of Adam Smith, Carl Marx, Joseph Schumpeter, F.A. Hayek, and today and continuing from here to the mid-term, we’re going to deal with real businesses. Okay, so one set of questions we’re going to have are a set of questions about the buyer. Either bypass surgery or the balloon procedure. In the first model of CardioThoracic Systems, it only allowed doctors to do surgery on one or two blood vessels, which would have replaced, I believe, the market for the balloon procedure, angioplasty. Now, as you indicated, the technological trajectory was to more and more vessels, so we’re going to spend a little bit of money if we’re this firm and we’re going to move to not only solving those problems but solving those problems. When we moved from the kind of only a couple vessels to many vessels, we’re giving up on some of the functionality associated with the product by cutting up patients a little bit more and that’s another feature that Schumpeter and others have talked about, including Clay Christensen, who talks about disruptive innovation that when you make a product change it is often the case that you don’t just improve, improve, improve, improve. And my ability, given what I am, to compete in each of these two markets is going to vary much, so the technological trajectory is influenced by the economics and the competitive piece of the story. That you are not just imagining yourself, a bunch of scientists in a lab, just trying to make it better, better, better, better. In fact, there are actually three different doctors you might think play a role in this situation. You’ve got interveners or decision makers all along the doctor element. So it turns out, one of the curiosities about healthcare, and it’s the one that’s bedeviling the Obama team now in terms of figuring things out, is we have this breakage of the link between people who make decisions about things and the people who pay for it. Why might the hospital be especially interested in that? So it’s actually going to vary for different hospitals depending on the contract that they’re going to get. But it might also benefit a patient because the technology would be less invasive, or something like that. Okay, so one of the things we might think about, the recovery angle is that the patient is going to care more than the doctor. ”From the point of view of solving the needs of these people, I can’t stay in this part of the business. They have broad product lines, they have big cash flows, and they spend a lot on R&D. You, some little pip squeak making Heartport, are going to rack your whole business on the idea that you don’t — you can attack these guys by saying they’re going to have — you’re going back to the hospital a lot, you can be sure they know that’s an issue for their company and they’re throwing a lot of money at it. The training issues; if I’m actually going to make this work in this business I have got what economists would call a complement — with an “e”, not an “i.” I’ve got to somehow — this kit doesn’t do it itself, this kit is used by doctors, surgeons; so I’ve got to figure out a way to train those guys. What do we know when you’re just starting to make money? Do you mean the learning process for the players in this particular case? The learning story with the yes answer is very obvious."
872,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-8,"Professor Rae uses the case of Polaroid cameras to highlight key features of the capitalist system. Polaroid’s business model, corporate culture, and firm trajectory are discussed. Important firm decisions are analyzed, including product offerings and mergers. Professor Rae explores factors that led to Polaroid’s demise, including the company’s relentless focus on scientific innovation at the expense of market research and product development. Polaroid was unable to keep up with market changes, such as the advent of the one-hour photo processing and the revolution in digital photography.","While we get settled, in our, as usual, gradual fashion, I’m going to turn on one of the videos involving the last two CEOs of Polaroid, and then after that, we’ll get into our normal routine. Okay, expected future earnings, along with some special sauce having to do with future strategy to maintain share price. They really are a projection of future cash flows to the shareholders, it’s just that it used to be in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends that were the bulk of those assumptions, and today it’s a rare company that makes more than 1% or 2% dividend yield on the stock price. And what was the precise event that caused them to file? I think less, it sold for $265 million at that end stage. Razor and blade, help us understand that. The question was — let’s think about three kinds of consumers, and this was largely a consumer product. It would be a professional or perfectionist. Digital photography, with one important asterisk, trumped everything. On average my guess is that your digital cameras are about like that? Her idea of a photo is something you hold in your hands and it’s not a real photo unless she can hold it in her hands, put it on the coffee table, show it to her friends from the coffee table, and Edwin Land actually agreed with that. And a full story of vertical integration looks like this; everything is in the corporate box from beginning to end. Of course there is no film, and there is no money in film. One of the very hard things about running a big company is that you have to be aware of all the other players out there who may be doing something to damage your market. I think it’s the culture of the company that they would — it’s the whole ego trip thing, they don’t really — kind of like they had to cheat and the vertical integration was part of the reason they were so proud of it. So cut down on your vertical integration. Jim, as I said to those of you who were here at the beginning of shopping period, Jim was Chief Financial Officer of Enron Global Power & Pipeline, and saw the process from the beginning."
873,political-science,plsc-270,lecture-9,"Jim Alexander, former CFO of the Enron subsidiary Enron Global Power and Pipeline, offers an insider’s account of Enron’s corporate culture and operations before the company’s spectacular fall. The leaders of Enron, Mr. Alexander asserts, disregarded concerns over the company’s ethics. Enron strategically found and exploited loopholes in accounting regulations to make their transactions as opaque as possible. Lack of regulation and oversight allowed Enron’s traders to inflate their numbers. Organizations that were in a position to oversee Enron’s operations sometimes faced grossly misaligned incentives that rewarded negligence. Mr. Alexander emphasizes the notion of the “rational economic man” in Enron’s corporate culture, and its predominance over notions of ethical corporate behavior.","Let me give a forward to you of today in relationship to the week afterward. I had a primitive sense of markets and I knew that I should avoid the smart people, much as I did in my classes. Economic college professor standards it’s not — I think Steve Ross makes a lot of money. He doesn’t make it here or at MIT though. Anyway — so I was — one of my past clients, and I was there, actually, at the start of Enron, because I was there — we helped refinance Enron’s huge amounts of debt that were about to go into default until we had done something when the — when Enron was created in 1984 or 1985, I think. But during that time anyone who walked the halls of Enron could pick up lots of information, and the only issue was whether you wanted to ignore it or not, and of course a lot of people’s excellent livelihoods depended on their ignoring the information freely available in the halls, which turned out generally to be quite accurate. So Enron is a very young entity, and grew up in the period after the fall, so to speak? Well you’d say they were brought up by wolves and therefore behave like wolves. These are prices not production amounts, but I have a general idea of what I’m going to produce in January, February and on and on. Most people who have a lot of debt or are squeezed for other reasons don’t take a flyer, so what they do is they can go to a commodities broker and say, what price will you give me for each month for the rest of the year? Generations of people could have built up the reputation of the firm, but maintaining a reputation, like maintaining a building, requires a lot of ongoing investment. So they say, well, a good firm I don’t have to worry about it. Once people started to say, “Well I don’t have to worry about ethics, I mean that’s — I just have to worry about being rational and realizing my own goals,” well the answer at that point is the whole system starts to go, and this is a perfect example because these are people, the people who engaged in this sort of deception, did not have any ethics and would actually view ethics as laughable. They’ll say, “I don’t understand this stuff, but I know that guy on the board, now he’s a quality guy.” They were able to get deals done much more quickly because he knows the assets so well. Of course once he did that, every time Enron wanted to sell us a project, the process being so tainted, we had to trade very hard because in effect I was trading with my own boss. Now Spinnaker Exploration was the next chapter for you, am I right? And for Smith the ethical side was explicit with a theory of moral sentiment."
874,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-10,"This lecture introduces students to the study of psychology from an evolutionary perspective, the idea that like the body, natural selection has shaped the development of the human mind. Prominent arguments for and against the theory of natural selection and its relationship to human psychology are reviewed. Students will hear several examples of how studying mental phenomenon from an evolutionary perspective can help constrain theories in psychology as well as explain many prevalent human instincts that underlie many of our most basic behaviors and decisions.",": We began the course by talking about one of the foundational ideas of modern psychology. For the eye it’s muscles that change the shape of the lens. We are impossibly far away from building a machine that can do what the human eye does. The complexity of the biological world suggests that these things are complicated artifacts created by a designer far smarter than any human engineer. And this is a particularly serious problem from the standpoint of the evolution of psychological structures. And this could be seen as equal in importance to the claim that the Earth revolves around the Sun and that we’re not the center of the universe. But the general idea is that there are three components to natural selection. ”And the biological world has all sorts of examples. And in fact, they’re both of the dangerous ideas. You bring these together and it forces you to the perspective that what we are — our mental life is no less than the eye, no less than camouflage, the product of this purely physical process of natural selection. More contentiously, you could argue they’ve been shaped by natural selection to solve certain problems. We have evolved mental capacities to solve different problems: perception of the world, communication, getting nutrition and rest, and so on. Don’t go looking for an adaptive reason for hiccups or self-pity or bloating after you eat. And we’ve evolved a taste for sweet things, in part, because the sweet things in our natural environment like fruit were good for us. Again this is an Introduction to Psych course. So, why would evolution matter?Well, many people think it doesn’t. So, you might not want evolution to be true about the mind because you might believe that the mind is not subject to the same physical laws as the rest of the physical world. So, the anthropologist Ashley Montagu in ‘73, close to when  was shown, by the way, said:With the exception of the reactions of infants to sudden withdrawals of support and to sudden loud noises, the human being is entirely instinctless. If I told you there is a biological adaptation for talking, mate selection, childcare; maybe it’s true, maybe it isn’t, but it’s not crazy. Other problems are recent and our brains could not be specialized to deal with them: written communication, interacting with strangers, driving a car, playing chess. You cannot be right because, from an evolutionary point of view, there could be no such part of the brain evolved because playing chess is a recent innovation. Something which, by and large, appears to be true. That’s an example of how the question — when dealing with this they say, “Hey. Now, some of you maybe not want to go into — not want to go into psychology because there’s no Nobel Prize for psychology. Think how proud Bubby and Zadie would be if I won a Nobel Prize. And I want to give some examples of these heuristics. If you’re asking how much you want for it, it’s a game. But if you’re being asked how much do you want for me to take it from you, you treat it as a loss. People — No matter what this number is — these numbers — it doesn’t seem to change who you think he is or how confident you are. It tests for a certain thing in your blood and “boom,” if the thing is in your blood the test will go “boom.” And this is simply that if you want to know how frequent something is, how available it is to come to mind is an excellent cue. What is the chance of getting killed by potato salad? That means you’d check “8” to see if there’s a “D” on the other side. “ You are a bartender and you want to make sure nobody under twenty-one drinks beer."
875,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-11,"This class is an introduction to the evolutionary analysis of human emotions, how they work, why they exist, and what they communicate. In particular, this lecture discusses three interesting case studies, that of happiness (e.g., smiling), fear and the emotions we feel towards our relatives. Finally, this lecture ends with a brief discussion of babies’ emotional responses to their caregivers.",": On Monday we — I presented an introduction to evolutionary psychology, the looking at psychology from an evolutionary perspective, and trying to make a case and give some examples of how it can help illuminate and illustrate certain aspects of how the mind works. And the clearest case of this arises with the emotions. Well, chocolate — The good tastiness of chocolate isn’t some necessary fact about the world. Data is an android who is said to lack an emotion chip. This lack of emotions on this — on a TV series does not hurt them much. It turns out that this is a notion of how to think about the emotions that is deeply wrong. Without emotions to drive us we would do nothing at all. And what they’ve lost is they basically lost a good part of their emotions. Emotions set goals and establish priorities. But at the same time, as Darwin well knew, emotions have universal roots that are shared across all humans and across many animals. Now, not surprisingly, people who have won Olympic gold medals are very happy. But they don’t actually stand on the podium grinning. You can ask yourself whether during sex, an activity where many people enjoy, whether or not people smile during sex. There is some evidence for a third sort of smile. This is sort of a very specialized sort of smile. There’s evidence that the coy smile shows up in non — The question was, “Do nonhuman primates give the same smiles that humans do?” Every culture is going to have Pan Am smiles, happiness smiles, coy smiles, but the variation of that sort is something which will vary as a result of how you’re raised and the people around you. And I want to deal with fear for different reasons. And it also brings us back to the lecture on behaviorism where we talked about classical conditioning and different theories of what people are afraid of. There are various ethical reasons why you can’t show babies — you can’t try to construct phobias in babies of spiders and snakes but the research she’s finding using more indirect methods finds, as one would expect, these are what psychologists would call “pre-potent stimuli”; that is, these are things that naturally elicit fear and concern. And so, that simple fact is why we would expect animals to care for their children, because children are the means through which genes replicate. Look at it from the perspective of the cold virus. Now, again, this is not some sort of bizarre quirk of a humorous god. Imagine a virus, for instance, that captured an animal’s brain and then modified the animal’s brain such that the animal would run out and bite other animals so as to pass on the virus. Along these lines, the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins took the general step of suggesting that animals are the vehicles through which genes exploit to reproduce. The other cubs are genetic competition for him. But, from your point of view, you’re wired up to respond to them. And in fact, this is how it works for all mammals. And you’ll see illustrations of this to follow."
876,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-12,"Professor Bloom continues the discussion of emotions as useful evolutionary adaptations for dealing with our social environment. In particular, this lecture describes evolutionary explanations for several important emotional responses, such as the love between parents and their offspring, the gratitude we feel towards cooperative behaviors, the spite we feel for cheaters, and the cultural differences in feelings of revenge.",": So what we’re doing today is continuing on the theme of emotions. “ And my evolutionary trick then is to focus very intently on them and make sure they survive. He studies why people hold religious beliefs. And you use that as a way to look at more general facts that exist even in our culture. Now, in the real world, it’s difficult to pull apart these two means of attraction because the very same woman who’s giving you comfort and social interaction is also the one giving you milk. This becomes hugely relevant for social debates like daycare. So Harlow, again, raised monkeys in solitary confinement so they were raised in steel cages with only a wire mother. The problem is, and we’re going to talk about this in much more detail in a couple of weeks, is it’s true that parents who aren’t affectionate have kids that aren’t affectionate but it’s not clear this is because of a genetic connection or an environmental connection. So when you get away from extreme cases, effects are hard to see and require careful experimental research to tease out. In particular, animals are nice to non-kin. And from a cold-blooded, natural selection, survival-of-the-gene point of view, you would imagine that if you lend me your kid for the day I would eat him for the protein and “it’s not my genes and actually it gives more for my kids.” Rather, it goes around the whole cave and vomits blood into the mouth of all the other vampire bats so everybody benefits. And you imagine how vampire bats, for instance, why this makes sense. It is not very adaptive to give a warning cry. So, in one clever study — So the theory says — the evolutionary theory says “yeah, I see what these vampire bats are doing,” but you see — and this is a case where evolution makes a nice prediction that couldn’t evolve unless bats are keeping track. Pretty soon you’re going to buy a round but you’re not going to give me one. The worst case is to cooperate while the other person defects. And it’s kind of difficult to get a divorce lawyer. So, you could show up with a gun, stick the gun in my face, take the thousand bucks, go home. If you screw with it, it will defect back on the next turn. This motivates us to behave better in the future. When economists study this they actually do this with real money. Similarly, you could mess with me because you could harass me in all sorts of ways, take things that I own, as long as you reason that a rational person wouldn’t start a fuss about this. There is some advantage to being irrational, to having a temper. The person who’s extremely reasonable or the person who has a hair-trigger temper? Most murder is not rational in its response. And it’s built around the difference turning around what sociologists call “cultures of honor. Corporal punishment and capital punishment tend to be more approved of. Or if somebody insults me, me killing him. Moreover, the culture of honor virtues like honor, loyalty, courage and self-reliance, are on the face of it not necessarily bad things. And we know this only from an analysis that starts from an evolutionary approach."
877,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-13,"Why are people different from one another? This lecture addresses this question by reviewing the latest theories and research in psychology on two traits in particular: personality and intelligence. Students will hear about how these traits are measured, why they may differ across individuals and groups, and whether they are influenced at all by one’s genes, parents or environment.",": What we’ve been talking about so far in the course are human universals, what everybody shares. And this is the class which is going to bother the most people. Some of you will get into little troubles all through your life. And so, I want to talk about the two main interesting factors. And this is what — These are the differences I’ll talk about today first from the standpoint of how do we characterize them, how do we explain them, and then from the standpoint of why these differences exist in the first place. Similarly, if I give you a personality test now and it says that you’re anxious and defensive, well — and then give it to you tomorrow and it says you’re calm and open minded, it’s not a reliable test. Validity is that your test measures what it’s supposed to measure. This is, in black and white form, a version of the Rorschach test, the Rorschach inkblot test. Catholic seminaries use it for people who want to join the seminary. And the idea is by looking at these inkblots and then seeing what somebody says you get great insights into the nature of their personality, into what they are. Well, it turns out that there are right answers and wrong answers to the Rorschach test. And this trail is characterized in terms of these five dimensions. One is an idea developed by Spearman, which is there’s two types of intelligence. And this factor is known as “G.”Now, there’s, again, an extensive history of modern intelligence tests and what’s really interesting is the tests now. It works on the normal curve and what this means is that it works so that the majority, 68%, get between 85 and 115 on their IQ test. How does — what’s the different — why are people different in intelligence? They could say nobody under six feet tall gets into Yale. The test constructors have done so in certain clever ways. And again, it’s a real art going through the details of how to do that but the broad answers involve reliability and validity. But the question of the role of genes and the role of environment in explaining human differences is an interesting one and it could be explored in different ways. Suppose I think you’re neurotic because when you were five years old somebody threw a snowball at you and it bounced off your head. So how do we tell what’s causing us to be alike?So to do — to pull these things apart you need to be clever. They share one hundred percent of the same genes. And in fact, one of the most surprising findings in behavioral genetics — The caption here  ended up at a patent office with the same device. But if I were to have an identical twin it would be very difficult to tell whose brain is whose even if we had no environment in common. There is high heritability for almost everything. But before getting to the more controversial thing I want to raise another issue which often gets discussed and has a good treatment in the textbook. So, whether or not you count as a Jew, for instance, depends not entirely on genetic factors but also on factors such as whether you’re reform or orthodox and whether you — so whether you would accept that a child of a Jewish man and a non-Jewish woman is Jewish. Again, the textbook has a good discussion of this but I’m going to give two reasons from the textbook that at least group differences are at least to a large extent due to environmental and not genetic causes. A second factor is that we know IQ can differ radically without any genetic differences at all. The Flynn effect is the finding that people have been getting smarter. One of these lines is American and one is Dutch. The case for this which generated the  cover came up in a controversial book by Judith Harris called  which has a very long subtitle, “Why Parents Turn — Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do, Parents Matter Less than You Think and Peers Matter More.” If your parents are poor, you’re likely to be poor. A bookish kid is more likely to get his parents to read to him. Take another case, the so-called cycle of violence. You might want to be nice to them because you want them to be happy."
878,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-14,"This lecture reviews what evolutionary theories and recent studies in psychology can tell us about sex and gender differences. Students will hear how psychology can help explain many of the differences that exist in whom we find attractive, what we desire in a mate, and sexual orientation.","You ask people, “What’s your favorite activity?” or some word that is synonymous with sex. So, people say sex is their favorite activity, but it turns out we actually know how much time the average American spends on sex. Now, of all the topics I’m presenting, sex is one of the sort of dicey ones from an emotional point of view. Nothing moral necessarily follows from the facts of biology. What did genes do to deserve their sinister, juggernaut-like reputation? It’s biologically caused but fairly easy to fix. It turns out when we – and we’ll get to this a little bit when we talk about sexual attractiveness – how thin somebody is or how fat they are; what you think of that is actually not particularly hard-wired. Why is it then that for so many animals males are the bigger ones, physically, and the more aggressive ones. Trivers points out that within a species, females typically have a much higher parental investment than males. And hence, each potential child is a huge cost. It explains why males are typically larger, and often why males have evolved special weapons. Well, it turns out this could explain some otherwise surprising things. So, in cases like pipefish, for instance, the male takes the eggs into a pouch and plugs them into his bloodstream. There’s no species — it’s hard to see species that have that much of an equal system, but some primates are close to it. And as adults, wherever you go you will find a prison. Well, you can get at this in different ways. Well, there are indirect measures, such who goes to prostitutes. We are not so high tech, so we’ll just do it in our heads. Women say less than one in the next month. And there are different answers to that, but one answer is, an average face, on average, should be considered attractive because any sort of deformities are variations from the average. But the story of attractiveness does not end there. That males are just socially clueless relative to women. There are so many reasons to hiss at this point. There are in particular the seeds of sexual orientation later on in life seem to show up quite early in life. Again, the studies are sort of suspect, but there’s some reason to believe that people who are gay and people who are straight are different long before they hit puberty with regard to their sexual and romantic fantasies. The answer is yes, you find that there is some sort of genetic predisposition towards homosexuality. My question’s not exactly like that one, but in other animals do they — is there similar data on other species? That’s a very good question because certainly your answer to the origin – give me two more minutes – certainly your answer about the origin of sexual preference in humans will be informed by the question of cross-species data."
879,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-15,"Professor Bloom provides an introduction to psychological theories of morality. Students will learn how research in psychology has helped answer some of the most central questions about human morality. For instance, which emotions are “moral” and why did these moral feelings evolve? What factors guide our moral judgments? And what factors predict when good people will do bad things?",": Let me begin by just reminding us where we are in this course, reminding us of what we’ve done and what we have yet to do. How many people here are either psych majors or expect to become psych majors or cognitive science as though you could raise your hand to? And so, I’m not going to spend any time on this because we’ve discussed it in detail, but we know from previous lectures that people will be generous to others. If you are hurt, that is, in some sense, painful for me. People differ to the extent it will hurt them to watch me slam my thumb with a hammer. In our affections, in our caring, who we like, who we feel close to, whose pain bothers us, we are not indiscriminate. We also favor our group over others in every possible way. What’s particularly interesting is even groups that are formed, that you were not born with, that are formed on the fly, exert a huge amount of control over your moral feelings and moral attitudes. By the logic of the Sherif it will bring us all together as a group. How you formed the groups — How is that morality?: If I’m American and you’re from another country, I will view myself — this is a very — kind of obvious finding — my obligations to you will be seen as less than if you were another American. Rather, some sort of moral judgment happens all the time, often unconsciously. My favorite moral dilemma is as I’m walking down the street and I see somebody I sort of know, do I avoid eye so we don’t have a conversation  and — but these are day-to-day moral questions we struggle with all the time and so there’s a centrality in the study of how we do moral reasoning. There are some aspects of moral reasoning that show up everywhere on earth. Some of you — You might have different views about divorce. And just keep in mind we’re getting sort of even responses here. And this one really is as bad as one might expect. For those of you who haven’t seen the movie, again, the setup is someone is a subject. They don’t know — They think that they’re teaching somebody in a memory game but actually the person who is being shocked is a confederate who is trained to react in certain ways as he’s being increasingly shocked. You remember from the movie nobody got pleasure from giving the shocks. So, just to take one example among many, Goldhagen argued that the participants in Nazi Germany and in the Holocaust were actually not people who were obediently following orders but rather were enthusiastic, people who volunteered to do it. You could diminish responsibility in other ways. If I’m wearing a mask as I do my terrible stuff, nobody will know it’s me, but there’s also a psychologically liberating effect. What is useful is point to somebody and say, “You in the green sweater, call the police,” and the psychological evidence is if you — if somebody’s — if I am wearing the green sweater and somebody asks me to call the police I will call the police. I wouldn’t sit aside when somebody’s being harmed. There’s a lot of ways to make other people matter less. People have distinct, individual names that mark them as people and once you know somebody’s name you are less likely to do bad things to them. And we know certain things about disgust. And the idea is he has economic codependence with these people. How would you feel if — “Then there’s indirect ways. You could write it up very short and that will be a passing grade if you just write it up very short."
880,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-16,"This is the first of two lectures on social psychology, the study of how we think about ourselves, other people, and social groups. Students will hear about the famous “six degrees of separation” phenomenon and how it illuminates important individual differences in social connectedness. This lecture also reviews a number of important biases that greatly influence how we think of ourselves as well as other people.",": This is going to begin a two-lecture sequence on social psychology on how we think about ourselves, how we think about other people, how we think about other groups of people. We are intensely interested in how other people work. You don’t know what to do yet with it so don’t worry. Most people were able to get the packages to this man and it took at maximum six degrees of separation, which is where the famous phrase comes about that we’re all separated from another person by six degrees of separation. Meryl Streep also isn’t it because Meryl Streep has the misfortune of playing only in good movies. So, some people in their day-to-day lives have many interactions and I think one of the things we know from interacting with people is we can distinguish them from other people. So, one answer is, well, because of the great intellectual benefits. So, my mornings are often rushed because I have two kids. And this is actually a useful thing to know. And the transparency effect is quite interesting. Just — I just need you to say three sentences. I want you to answer with one of those answers there. The task will be for everybody else to recognize and guess which one you’re lying about. We often feel like things bleed out of us and so people will systematically overestimate the extent to which other people notice their secrets. It turns out though that people will systematically and dramatically view themselves as better than average. In a normal, productive, healthy, happy environment, people don’t scream at you about how bad you’re doing but they compliment how good you are and that could lead to an inflated self-esteem on the part of people in certain domains. For a driver, for instance, when I ask you to rank how good you are as a driver, what people often do is they think — they say, “I’m better than average,” but what they do is they focus on one aspect of their driving. And what Festinger was interested in was the idea that what happens when people experience an inconsistency in their heads. If you are a political — If you are running for office, you will tend to have volunteers and not necessarily pay people. In fact though, the children who you reward later on think that this activity has less value and they are less likely to do it when there’s no reward present. I want to move now to how we think about self and other, how we think about ourselves relative to how we think about other people. Suppose you insult me or suppose you’re very kind to me. And more generally, people tend to give too much weight to the person and not enough weight to the situation. If you were giving a job talk — and this is for people in graduate school particularly — If you were giving a job talk and the slide projector breaks, you’re screwed. Nobody is going to say to themselves, “Oh, well, it’s not such a good talk because the slide projector broke.” His career, where he attempted many times to play roles that were different from his Vulcan nature, stalled until finally many years later he gave up and wrote another book called  If I gave this lecture ten years ago, I would say that the fundamental attribution error is a human universal, something that we’re born with, a fundamental aspect of human nature. So, call it a tie but then there’s a lot more colleges that aren’t yours than the one — How many of you would you — say your best friend is somebody your — currently on your same floor? Finally, people like good-looking people."
881,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-17,"This lecture begins with the second half of the discussion on social psychology. Students will learn about several important factors influencing how we form impressions of others, including our ability to form rapid impressions about people. This discussion focuses heavily upon stereotypes, including a discussion of their utility, reliability, and the negative effects that even implicit stereotypes can incur. The second half of the lecture introduces students to two prominent mysteries in the field of psychology. First, students will learn what is known and unknown about sleep, including why we sleep, the different types of sleep, disorders, and of course, dreams, what they are about and why we have them. Second, this half reviews how laughter remains a mysterious and interesting psychological phenomenon. Students will hear theories that attempt to explain what causes us to laugh and why, with a particular emphasis on current evolutionary theory.",": Just to review, here’s where we left off. Your first impression sets a framework from which you interpret everything else. And the running joke of the movie “Being There” was that the main character, the character Chauncey Gardner, somehow through accident had the reputation for being a genius but while, in reality, he was actually mildly retarded. So, first impressions can shape subsequent impressions not just when dealing with people. So, university professors have teaching evaluations and you could use this as a rough and ready approximation of what students think of them. Do you have to see them for a full class? What I want to talk about here though is a different aspect of how we think about human groups. You might have positive stereotypes about certain groups. You won’t look at this as a scientist objectively scanning data. The media would include television and movies but would also include plays and books and stories. On the other hand, what if insurance companies determined that people from Asia got into more accidents than people from Europe? Here is how to make black people do worse on this math test. If the stereotype is “your group doesn’t do good in this,” if I remind you that you’re a member of that group immediately before doing it, your performance will drop. Those are your public presentations of stereotypes. Now, it is as close to one hundred percent as you can get it. These numbers are so low they could be dismissed as people filling in the wrong things or making jokes or just being confused compared to  stunningly superstitious high rankings. They’re done with the standard university undergraduates like you and these — and if you were in this group you wouldn’t say, “Oh. But when their recommendations are so-so, when it’s a judgment call, the subjects are significantly more likely to hire the white American than the African American. The idea is that everybody holds stereotypes. It takes work both at the individual level and it takes work at the group level. A lot of journals do blind reviewing now because of the evidence I talked about before regarding sexual stereotypes, that whether it has a male name or a female name makes a difference. Your brain is active as if you were awake, your EEGs are similar to waking, paralyzed except for the eyes, oh, men get erections and you have dreams. So, when you sleep growth producing hormone goes through the body, your brain and other organs get restored, there are — you need less food, your immune system seems to be hard at work, and in fact, one answer — people always wonder what happens if you’d stop sleeping and the answer is not one discovered in the laboratory but it’s been recorded in different cases. You get sick and then you die, suggesting that sleeping is good to keep you healthy. The lists of reasons to kill himself were “the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,” “a sea of troubles,” and “the heartache in the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to.” Most of what people — what made people laugh wasn’t in any sense a joke or humorous. The laugh track makes things a lot funnier because people laugh a lot more when they’re in groups. When you’re in a group doing something terribly aggressive and you are not — you don’t feel like you’re at risk you might laugh and laughter is a signal to other members of your group as a signal of solidarity and what you’re doing together. This is what — this is where the humor for that baby comes in, which is you couldn’t predict when the sound was coming and some aspect of that was what made it so funny then, what elicited the laughter."
882,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-18,"Professor Susan Nolen-Hoeksema describes how modern clinical psychology both identifies and treats various mental disorders. Particular focus is placed upon mood disorders such as bipolar disorder and depression, including current diagnostic criteria and current practices for treatment.","I am extremely pleased to introduce the fourth and final guest lecture of the semester. She basically does everything someone can do. If you’re paranoid and hyper-vigilant, looking for threat in downtown Baghdad, that’s considered very adaptive behavior these days because it could prevent you from getting hurt or killed. And that very, very high level of distress is part of the reason why it’s labeled as a mental disorder. And this complete decline in functioning is one of the major reasons that we consider depression one of the most debilitating disorders. But if a set of behaviors is completely unacceptable to a culture, highly unusual, they’re more likely to end up getting labeled as abnormal. As many as one in four women will have an episode of serious depression at some time in her life, and about 13% of men will have an episode of serious depression in their lives. So, you might say that you feel sad and blue and just — or actually say you feel depressed. Number five is feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt. And it is true that there is this continuum from getting bummed out because you didn’t do well on a test or because you broke up with a boyfriend or girlfriend or something like this and being completely not functional, vegetative, the way that this woman becomes whenever she gets depressed. The other things I wanted to comment on that she talks about early on in this piece is the fact that she hauls herself up and goes through her day, even when she’s feeling really, really depressed. And that’s something that’s very, very common, and it’s in part because people don’t feel as though they should have to get treatment or they’re ashamed of getting treatment or seeking help for depression. And sometimes they can become violent because they’re just — they’re so incredibly agitated and irritable. In the last little bit there you saw her flip from her mania into a more depressed state. So, I want to show you another clip — it’s a little bit longer — of a man who has bipolar disorder. He is not currently in an episode of either depression or mania, but again, he can talk about some of the things he got himself into and how it manifested in his behavior. And there is a wonderful book by Kay Jamison, who is a professor at Johns Hopkins where she chronicles — She does sort of historical biographies on a number of well-known authors and poets and musicians, Robert Schumann and a number of politicians, Winston Churchill and such, arguing that they actually had mild forms of bipolar disorder and that they were able to sort of channel the manic episodes through extraordinary talent or intelligence in ways that made it work for them. They can, as I said, get involved in sexual promiscuity that puts them at risk for sexually transmitted diseases. It may be that they’re all true to some extent. There are biological hypotheses that have to do with hormones. So, this is actually a compilation of a group of studies. This is true in both bipolar and in depression. And in people with chronic depression, you often see shrinkage in the hippocampus, and this may be related to their problems in concentration and attention. Aaron Beck is a psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania who really founded this whole line of work. So prospectively, these characteristics seem to predict your risk for depression. So, both of them resulted in about 60% of people not being depressed. But I just want to comment on a couple of things that she’s doing. So, you see that she’s having him generate his own challenges to his negative thoughts and write them down. But to end, the good news about depression is that there are these alternative therapies."
883,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-19,"This lecture continues to cover one of the most salient areas within the field of psychology known as psychopathology, or clinical psychology. Following a discussion of the different ways of defining mental illness, Professor Bloom reviews several classes of clinical diagnoses including schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, dissociative disorders, and personality disorders. The lecture concludes with a brief introduction to therapy.",": The final topic of the course is clinical psychology, also known as abnormal psychology or psychopathology, and this, for many of us, is what psychology is really about. Others are also talking to psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and other people. Many of you who are not at this point mentally ill will become mentally ill during your stay at Yale. By one estimate, one half of all college graduates in the United States – and the number is very high with college graduates, highly educated people – one half of you will have some sort of mental illness in your life serious enough to require some sort of treatment. And these are political and social and moral biases. They do not tend to be more creative or more productive or more vivacious. Men are much more likely to suffer from substance disorders, particularly alcoholism. The roots of schizophrenia come from the terms “split” and “mind” but the idea is there is a split from reality. A multiple personality disorder is an entirely different disorder. Many schizophrenics have a religious bent and believe that they are Jesus Christ. You hear people whispering and you think they’re talking about you. So, paranoid schizophrenics believe that others are spying and plotting against them. And they often have delusions of grandeur. And finally, the disorganized schizophrenics are maybe what you most think of when you think of somebody who is insane. They — their actions — they could be dangerous. Remember we talked about the worst study in the world and one of the features of this was it was failing to pull apart cause and effect. First, it doesn’t explain the negative symptoms. And this mystery is discussed nicely in the Gray textbook. The primary disturbance in anxiety disorders is anxiety; you have a lot of anxiety. Here’s a nice diagram of different phobia, different things, and their proportion of people who are afraid of it. There is a classical conditioning model of phobias, which we are all familiar with, but we are all familiar with why it is not a very good theory. So, if you just have a superstition saying “Step on a crack, break your mother’s back,” which has never been scientifically proven,  but suppose you — and then so you’re just kind of “Oh, I kind of — I just kind of — ” or it’s bad luck to break a mirror and that’s it, you just have it and it doesn’t make a big deal to you, that’s harmless. And often obsessive-compulsive disorders have a religious or a magical manifestation where you believe there are certain things you must do or terrible things will happen and in that way you could view them as extreme and build from superstitions, but simple superstitions don’t tend to be of that type. There is — I will — I have here in, actually, Dr. Nolen-Hoeksema’s excellent abnormal psychology textbook a checklist of dissociative experiences many of which normal people have: “Not sure whether one has done something or only thought about it.” When it wears off your old identity comes back and your new identity is forgotten. And one idea is that it’s abuse plus some sort of genetic or biological predisposition to dissociate and in fact, people with dissociative identity disorder seem to be very susceptible. One worry based on these facts is dissociative identity disorder is in a sense real, that Richard really does believe he’s moving from personality to personality but he didn’t come in to therapy with that problem. Now, most murderers are not mentally ill in a medical sense. You have to avoid the temptation when you think about psychopath to think about a guy like this, to think about Hannibal Lecter. And what some people have argued is the real psychopaths, the successful ones, are the ones that run the world, that excel in every field because they are successful enough that they don’t look like psychopaths."
884,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-1,"Professor Paul Bloom welcomes students and presents the course as a comprehensive introduction to the study of the human mind. Course readings and requirements are discussed. The five main branches of psychology are presented: neuroscience, which is a study of the mind by looking at the brain; developmental, which focuses on how people grow and learn; cognitive, which refers to the computational approach to studying the mind; social, which studies how people interact; and clinical, which examines mental health and mental illnesses.",": I’d like to welcome people to this course, Introduction to Psychology. In some cases, the lectures will be quite linked to the readings. You take notes any way you choose, but if you don’t get anything on there it’ll be available online. The exams will be multiple choice and short answer, fill in the blank, that sort of thing. Starting at the beginning of the third week of class – that is not next week but the week after – on each Monday I’m going to put up a brief question or set of questions, which you have to answer and your answers need to be sent to your teaching fellow. The issue sometimes comes up as to how to do well in the course. Now, this is a large class, and if you don’t do anything about it, it can be very anonymous. And I’m going to try — and when these issues come up — I’m going to try to stress them and make you try to think about the extent to which the laboratory research I’ll be talking about can affect your everyday life: how you study, how you interact with people, how you might try to persuade somebody of something else, what sort of therapy works best for you. There is social, which is the study of how people act in groups, how people act with other people. I am convinced that you cannot study the mind solely by looking at the discipline of psychology. And the question that preoccupies developmental psychologists is how do we come to have this knowledge, and in particular, how much of it is hard-wired, built-in, innate. He couldn’t speak for five minutes without cursing. And this is again an extraordinary example of how the brain can give rise to the mind, and how things that go wrong with the brain can affect you in a serious way. And so, it would be a shame for me not to use them to cover some of these issues."
885,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-20,"The last lecture in the course wraps up the discussion of clinical psychology with a discussion of treatment efficacy. Does therapy actually work? Professor Bloom summarizes the different types of influences that clinical interventions might have on people who receive therapy.Professor Bloom ends with a review of one of the most interesting research topics in “positive psychology,” happiness. What makes us happy? How does happiness vary across person and culture? What is happiness for? Students will hear how the most recent research in psychology attempts to answer these questions and learn how people are surprisingly bad at predicting what will make them happiest.","Before starting the lecture I just want to do some final procedural issues. For the most part, we do better now, and Dr. Nolen-Hoeksema reviewed some of the therapies with focus on therapies for depression. I guarantee you your next day would probably be better. That doesn’t mean naked jumping jacks are helping you. Rather, it just means that the day after the worst day of your life usually is not as bad as the worst day of your life. Those who get help are likely to be better off than those that don’t get help. Typically, there’s an enthusiasm behind therapy. Placebo effect” is often used sort of in a dismissive way, “Oh, it’s just a placebo,” but placebos can be powerful and even if it’s useless from a real point — from a psychological theory point of view, even if the therapist runs around and dances while you – I have dancing on my mind now – while you sit in the chair and watch him dance; if you believe the dancing is going to make you better, it may well help. And what I want to do is tell you what I think is the most interesting research from this movement concerning happiness. There are slight differences depending on your place within a country, California versus New York. Americans are actually pretty happy, 7.71. Now, I’m going to talk about a lot of research that’s based on the data you get when you ask people how happy they are from a scale of one to ten. And logically, what seems to go on is that if you’re asked how’s the weather, you’re “Oh, it’s really sunny outside,” and then when people are asked “How happy are you with your whole life?” The first is happiness doesn’t change as much as you think. You’d say, “Hell, I’m a 10.5, I am very happy.” There are some very interesting exceptions. ”Now, in these books I talked about at the beginning these authors give advice on how to deal with the hedonic treadmill. So, the first moral of the science of happiness is that your happiness is actually rather fixed. But beyond that your happiness depends on your relative circumstance. The opera star Maria Callas and the English professor Stanley Fish had the same negotiating strategy. The final finding is a bit of a jump to a different topic but — sorry. And I mentioned the Nobel prize a little while ago as an example but the work I’m going to talk about is actually from the one psychologist who’s alive who’s won the Nobel prize — sorry, one of the ones who’s won the Nobel prize, Daniel Kahneman. And you remember him from his rationality research and this is some work on happiness. And so I want to close this course by emphasizing two themes. Now, the reason why I’m optimistic is I think there’s been some success stories where we really have learned some surprising and important things about the mind and there’s no reason to expect this way of proceeding to fail us in the future. In my very — in the very first class on the brain I ended by talking about people’s worries here, and I’ll be honest, that some people find it a scary prospect."
886,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-2,"This lecture introduces students to two broad theories of how the mind relates to the body. Dualism is the ubiquitous and intuitive feeling that our conscious mind is separate from our physical bodies, whereas Materialism is the idea that all of our mental states are caused by physical states of the brain. This lecture reviews arguments explaining why materialism has become the predominant theory of mind in psychology. This discussion is followed by a basic overview of the neurophysiology of the brain.",": We’re going to begin the class proper, Introduction to Psychology, with a discussion about the brain. ”It is fair to describe this as astonishing. Now, dualism is a very different doctrine. It was very explicit in Plato, for instance. These were not electrical robots, of course. So, Descartes would walk around the French Royal Gardens and the French Royal Gardens were set up like a seventeenth-century Disneyland. This he came to using the method of doubt. And, of course, the modern version of this is The Matrix. Maybe everything you’re now experiencing is not real, but rather is the product of some other, perhaps malevolent, creature. Descartes, similarly, could doubt he has a body. And so, Descartes used the method of doubt to say there’s something really different about having a body that’s always uncertain from having a mind. One thing is our dualism is enmeshed in our language. And what this means is that common sense tells us that somebody can be the same person even if their body undergoes radical and profound changes. Some cultures have you going to Heaven or descending to Hell. He was reasonable enough in concluding, for instance, as he did, that there’s no way a merely physical object could ever play a game of chess because — and that such a capacity is beyond the capacity of the physical world and hence you have to apply — you have to extend the explanation to an immaterial soul but now we know — we have what scientists call an existence proof. And this is no surprise if what we are is the workings of our physical brains, but it is extremely difficult to explain if one is a dualist. What I want to do though now is provide a big picture. So, one of the discoveries of psychology is that the basic unit of the brain appears to be the neuron. These — Again, the chemicals could excite the other neuron (excitatory) bring up the chances it will fire, or inhibit the other neuron (inhibitory).Now, neurotransmitters become interesting because a lot of psychopharmacology, both of the medical sort and the recreational sort, consists of fiddling with neurotransmitters and so you could see this through some examples. For one thing, the brain is highly resistant to damage. One consideration in all of this is that this is a very young field and nobody knows how to do it yet. This is a sort of schematic diagram – you’re not responsible for this – of parts of the visual cortex, and the thing to realize about this is it’s extraordinarily simplified. The medulla, for instance, is responsible for heart rate and respiration. And the cortex can be broken up into different parts or lobes. Now, two things to notice about these maps. There are disorders of language like aphasia. There’s other disorders of language such as receptive aphasia where the person could speak very fluently but the words don’t make any sense and they can’t understand anybody else. Your left hemisphere controls the right side of the body. So, we would solve — We study people much as we’d study a computer from an alien planet or something. I’m going to be trying to explain fundamental aspects of ourselves including questions like how do we make decisions, why do we love our children, what happens when we fall in love, and so on."
887,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-3,"This lecture introduces students to the theories of Sigmund Freud, including a brief biographical description and his contributions to the field of psychology. The limitations of his theories of psychoanalysis are covered in detail, as well as the ways in which his conception of the unconscious mind still operate in mainstream psychology today.","The last class we talked about the brain. So, we’re going to talk about somebody’s idea about racial prejudice but that’s not a theory of language acquisition. Some biographical information: He was born in the 1850s. He wrote a letter saying, “Don’t give the prize to Freud. He was also — He’s also disliked, often hated, because of his views. And to some extent, this accusation has some truth to it. And so, each of you inferred at that point that you had been castrated. Now, unfortunately, life doesn’t work like that. So, according to Freud, there are people in this room who are what they are because they got stuck in the oral stage or the anal stage. Depriving him of the breast, could lead to serious problems in his personality development. ”A phrase even more popular is the anal stage and that happens after the oral stage. If you have problems during those years of life, you could become an anal personality, according to Freud, and your roommate could say, “Your problem is you’re too anal.” So far so — And so this is not crazy; a little boy falling in love with his mother. So, they come to the conclusion that their father is going to castrate them because of their illicit love for their Mom. And the genital stage is the stage we are all in – the healthy adult stage. There are certain desires we’d rather not know and we have ways to hide them. So, you can imagine a great artist like Picasso turning the sexual energy into his artwork. They might suck their thumb, seek out a blanket or so on. But I’m going to present this as an example here because it illustrates so many of the Freudian themes, particularly themes about dreams, the importance of dreams, about repression and about hidden meaning. Freud believed that literature and fairy tales and stories to children and the like carried certain universal themes, certain aspects of unconscious struggles, and certain preoccupations of our unconscious mind. And that’s such a good question I’m going to defer it. One way you could reject a theory is that it could be wrong. And this is one of the main critiques of Freud. Maybe more surprising, Freud’s insight that our likes and dislikes are due to factors that we’re not necessarily conscious of has a lot of empirical support — a lot of empirical support from research into social psychology, for example. The flashing of these subliminal words, “subliminal” meaning – a fancy term meaning below the level of consciousness, you don’t know you’re seeing them – has dramatic effects on how you answer those questions. The point now is simply to illustrate that these sort of things can have — that things you aren’t aware of can have an effect on how you think. To do this, I’m going to cut the class in half at this point so you’ll be on this side of the class, the right side, my right, and this will be on the left side, and I simply want everybody to think about somebody you love. He says, “List — ” The other group gets ten positive features, “smart, beautiful, kind… really nice… good cook… punctual, smart… No, I mentioned that.” The problem is nobody has ten positive features! We have time for some further questions about Freud and about scientific implications of Freud. Freud studied the mind and the brain and was intensely interested in the neural basis of thought and behavior. Although Freud was very sensitive to the brain basis of behavior, Freud was totally convinced that the method through which to cure disorders like depression and anxiety would not be medication but rather through the sort of talk therapy and insight."
888,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-4,"Professor Bloom opens with a brief discussion of the value and evolutionary basis of unconscious processing. The rest of this lecture introduces students to the theory of Behaviorism, particularly the work of prominent behaviorist, B. F. Skinner. Different types of learning are discussed in detail, as well as reasons why behaviorism has been largely displaced as an adequate theory of human mental life.",": I actually want to begin by going back to Freud and hitting a couple of loose ends. And an answer that some psychologists and biologists have given is deception. And the story of Skinner and science is somewhat different from the story of Freud. This is the very simplest form of learning. And that’s not the way animals or humans work. And also, it’s useful because harmful stimuli are noticed but when something has shown itself to be part of the environment you don’t notice it anymore. The existence of habituation is important for many reasons. Pavlov, when he started this research, had no interest at all in learning. So when Pavlov, for instance — Well, when Pavlov, for instance, started before conditioning there was simply an unconditioned stimulus, the food in the mouth, and an unconditioned response, saliva. But over and over again, if you put the bell and the food together, pretty soon the bell will generate saliva. So, the idea here is, repeated pairings of the unconditioned stimulus and the conditioned stimulus will give rise to the response. You’re — and to put it in a crude way, you’re teaching the dog that the bell goes with the food. This is one of a long list of experiments that we can’t do anymore. But the presence of the dog there is a conditioned stimulus and so you grew to be afraid of dogs. But nothing bad happens so his fear goes away. So the strong classical conditioning stories about fetishes and fears sound silly and extreme and they probably are but at the same time classical conditioning can be used at least to shape the focus of our desires and of our interests. The mainstream view is now a little bit more interesting. You choose to do things and by dint of your choices. There’s two — One technical distinction that people love to put on Intro Psych exams is that the difference between positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement. Now, saying “Good dog” is not something your dog has been built, pre-wired, to find pleasurable. Finally, in the examples we’re giving, whenever the pig does something you like you reinforce it. The difference between ratio is a reward every certain number of times somebody does something. So, for example, a slot machine is variable ratio. It goes off after it’s been hit a certain number of times. And then later on the kid’s going to say, “I want to do it again” and you say no and the kid keeps asking because you’ve put it, well, put it as in a psychological way, not the way the behaviorists would put it. If I want my kid to do something, I should say yes one out of every ten times. And here’s a more sophisticated illustration of the same point. : And this is the sort of finding, an old finding from before most of you were born, that was a huge embarrassment for the Skinnerian theory, as it suggests that rats in fact had mental maps, an internal mechanism that they used to understand the world – entirely contrary to the behaviorist idea everything could be explained in terms of reinforcement and punishment. But if you take an animal and you give it a new food and then you shock it very painfully it won’t avoid the new food. But Skinner doesn’t literally mean that when we talk to ourselves somebody gives us food pellets. What he means, for instance, in this case is well, talking to yourself is self-reinforcing or giving bad news to an enemy is reinforcing because it makes your enemy feel bad. Finally, and this is something I’m going to return to on Wednesday actually, behaviorists have provided powerful techniques for training particularly for nonverbal creatures so this extends to animal trainers."
889,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-5,"This lecture explores issues and ideas related to the branch of psychology known as cognitive development. It begins with an introduction of Piaget who, interested in the emergence of knowledge in general, studied children and the way they learn about the world in order to formulate his theories of cognitive development. This is followed by an introduction to the modern science of infant cognition. Finally, the question of the relationship between and the existence of different kinds of development is addressed.",": So, most of what we do these days – our methods, our theories, our ideas – are shaped, to some extent, by Piaget’s influence. He often described them as little scientists. And incidentally, to know where he’s coming from on this, he had a very dramatic and ambitious goal. We’ll figure how a kid develops and that will tell us about the development of knowledge more generally. ”So, Piaget viewed the child as a scientist who developed this understanding, these schemas, these little, miniature theories of the world. And he had a stage theory, which was quite different from the Freudian stage theory that we have been introduced to. And Piaget’s claim was one reason why they’re surprised at peek-a-boo is you go — you look at a kid, the kid’s smiling and go, “Oh, peek-a-boo,” and you close — and you cover your face and the kid says, “He’s gone.” “ He claimed that children at this age literally can’t understand that others can see the world differently from them. Methodology is going to loom heavy in the discussion of any science and that includes psychology. Does it have to be a surprise, and so on? Do babies distinguish pretty faces from ugly faces? But of course, if you were a simple perceptual creature, you would just see that there’d be a bar on top and a bar on the bottom. Now, if the babies expect the block to still be there, they should think the block should stop the screen. We know there are certain things babies don’t know. So, although some things are built in, some things develop. And this is one of them where they compare babies looking at this versus this. Can we see — use some of the same methods that we’ve looked at for the physical world to look at the social world?And to illustrate one of the studies, I’ll tell you about a study that I did with Valerie Kuhlmeier and Karen Wynn. And this we take as preliminary evidence that they have a social interpretation. One thing to know methodologically is the person giving a choice is blind to the study. I’ll show you the studies and then we’ll briefly discuss what they mean. And it’s possible that children kind of got overwhelmed with it, and when asked what would the mother think, who the mother would think stole the food, responded with who really stole the food. He kept pointing to the rocket ship and mean monkey kept taking it away. And the classic case of this is a disorder known as autism. You show the child the following situation. The question of where is the ball really is a question about the physical world. Four-year-olds and five-year-olds are able to pass this task. They’re both experiments designed to tap an appreciation of false belief. And some people with autism have extraordinary artistic abilities or mathematical abilities or musical abilities and these are amazing. This is by the famous biologist, D’Arcy Thompson, who wrote the book  and it’s sort of the model of many developmental psychologists and many evolutionary psychologists so I’ll end with this: “Everything is the way it is because it got that way.”"
890,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-6,"One of the most uniquely human abilities is the capacity for creating and understanding language. This lecture introduces students to the major topics within the study of language: phonology, morphology, syntax and recursion. This lecture also describes theories of language acquisition, arguments for the specialization of language, and the commonalities observed in different languages across cultures.","And language is, to a large extent, where the action is. I’m including here people like Aristotle and Plato, Hume, Locke, Freud and Skinner. Now, I’ll first, before getting into details, make a definitional point. And this is the puzzle faced by the psychology and cognitive science of language. And one reason we know this is because of the demonstrated case studies where a language is created within a single generation. And this is interesting because this suggests that to some extent the ability to use and understand and learn language is part of human nature. And one bit of evidence that these genes are implicated is that some unfortunate people have point mutations in these genes. And what this means is that any theory of language use and language comprehension cannot simply appeal to a list. When you understand a sentence I said you have to have the capacity to understand a sentence even if you’ve never heard it before. The pig is eager to eat” means the state of affairs that we’re talking about is when the pig does the eating. “ The natural interpretation, in fact, is that Bill knew that John liked Bill. Now that — If the only language you’ve ever heard is English, that’s going to seem like a really weird example of a problem because you’re listening to me speak and in between each of my words you’re hearing a pause. You could see this when you hear a language you don’t already know. I got a big lecture about copyright laws and this is going to violate most of them. And this is extremely useful when it comes to filling in gaps in sounds. How we see the world is often confusing and befuddled but what we know can clear things up. It allows for this map between a symbol, say a spoken word, and any sort of thought we want to use. And what a morpheme is is the smallest meaningful unit in a language. You have one rule invoking another rule and then you can get a sentence like “Fred thinks Barney likes Wilma.” And a police officer sees them and points the gun at them. Now, the brother who did the shooting was plainly a murderer. Interestingly, it doesn’t have to be that many people. Instead, we should view it as something similar to growth. Why, then, should we not study the acquisition of a cognitive structure like language more or less as we study some complex bodily organ?So, you might learn to play baseball, you might learn about the American Civil War, but if Chomsky is right you didn’t learn to speak English. There can be specific impairments of language. But the cases of specific language impairments suggest that all of that is wrong, because there are children in this world right now who are plenty smart, who really want to communicate, and who are entirely social creatures but they can’t learn language. Similarly, if a child is to say, “I hate your guts, Mother,” it’s an unusual mother, “That’s wonderful. You want to change your diaper right now so stay still.” They start using first words, first sentences, first complicated constructions. Around twelve months of age, children start using their first words. They start producing little, miniature sentences like “Want cookie” or “Milk spill” and the function morphemes, the little words, “in,” “of,” “a,” “the,” and so on start to gradually appear."
891,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-7,"This lecture finishes the discussion of language by briefly reviewing two additional topics: communication systems in non-human primates and other animals, and the relationship between language and thought. The majority of this lecture is then spent on introducing students to major theories and discoveries in the fields of perception, attention and memory. Topics include why we see certain visual illusions, why we don’t always see everything we think we see, and the relationship between different types of memory.",": Two follow-ups on yesterday’s — I’m sorry, on Monday’s lecture. This is the summary about nonhuman communication systems. So, bats use echolocation to get around and some birds navigate by the stars, but there’s not an active research program seeing if cats can use echolocation or dogs could navigate by the stars. Remember when Darwin described language as an instinct. Now, some of this work is discussed in the readings, the book — the Gray textbook, and the selections from  And this makes up — again, I’ve showed this to you on Monday — your reading response where you have to address this question and take your best shot at answering it. If I’m just learning English, I use all of it for English. And you’d expect them to be each learned slower. For attention, I want to suggest that we attend to some things and not others and we miss a surprising amount of what happens in the world. That’s not the way to look at it because that doesn’t answer any questions. And so, you have to figure out which is which. Rather, you automatically factor out the change in illumination as this is happening. This can’t be the same as this” but the answer is — goes like this. Rather, we know this in that it’s wired up in our brains. When you see things that are close to each other, you’re more likely than not to assume that they belong to the same thing. You see this  and you don’t — You see it on one level as a flat thing. Another level you look inside the picture and you see, for instance, the man is in front of the house. But the natural assumption is the reason why the dots recede in this regular fashion is because it’s receding in depth. And one explanation for why is, these other lines in the scene cause your visual system to make guesses about distance. And because we assume that this is further away, we assume it must be bigger to take up the same space as this which is closer. And the answer is the same answer that will explain the Mueller-Lyer illusion and the Ponzo illusion, having to do with cues to depth and the way your mind corrects the perception of depth. And  so what you imagine is you imagine them losing their autobiographical memory, their sense of self. And we’ll return to this and then ask what’s going on here. Sensory memory is a residue in your senses. Some things come from attention — to attention effortlessly and automatically. Red, green, blue, black, green, blue, red, blue, black, red. One of them is going to have white T-shirts. Could you clap when you see what’s different between the two pictures? And have a map and then the person would say, “Sure.” And then there’d be two construction workers holding a door. And these guys were going to rudely bump between these two characters and then the experimenter gets switched with another guy. And it was originally done in a different way but I’ll show it to you just because this is the original study and now that you all know what to expect — Oh, not that one."
892,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-8,"In this lecture, Professor Bloom reviews the basic psychological research on memory. Specific topics covered include the different memory types, memory limitations, strategies that improve memory, and memory disorders. This lecture also includes a discussion of several important social implications for memory research, such as recovered memories, and the influence of suggestibility on eyewitness testimony.",": I’ll begin the class officially with a different sort of demonstration. I want to just show you one of the change-blindness studies that has been done in the real world. But it’s important to realize, to get away from the sort of surprise of the gorilla and the fact that it’s hard to see the flickering — the object that’s flickering, and appreciate the big moral of this, because the big moral of this is actually, I think, striking and quite important. Now, the obvious distinction is actually just in fact — is storage differences. Compare this to working memory – the short-term memory, which is actually very limited. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine or more? And if you remember it in twenty minutes you will get one thousand dollars. If you tell it to an — because you know something — If a lot depended on it, you would know to do something. The problem is you could hold it as long as you can do that. The third group was told, “Does it fit into the sentence ‘The girl placed the blank on the table’? At first it is better to run than to walk. If you have to remember something you learned in this class, you will do better if you try to think about the room in which you learned it in. Every class I’ve given somebody asks either in class or by e-mail what about déjà vu? These are sort of statistics in a similar experiment . Well, there’s different explanations for this. You bring him in and over and over again — Each time he does it he starts off by saying, “I’ve never seen this before. Those of you who have seen the movie know that this ends up quite tragically for Sammy. Remember one theme of this course is we’re going to look at exotic cases like the case of Clive Wearing, not just because they’re interesting in their own right but sometimes by looking at the extremes we could learn something about how normal people’s normal, intact minds and brains work. The first and third children had their memories implanted, not through any sort of science fiction means. Just knowing this about Sam Stone tends to raise the proportion of kids who say, for instance, that he ripped the book. You also can integrate suppositions made by others. Now, there was no school bus but people who hear that question later on when asked, “Did you see a school bus in the film?” And people under hypnosis just make stuff up. There are many adults who have claimed to have experienced traumatic sexual abuse. They’ve always known it happens to them and then they tell people about it. Flashbulb memories are the idea that these memories being so vivid, and they are vivid for many of us — exactly where we stood, what happened; well, they can’t really be trusted. And now maybe my memory is actually of her experience and not mine. I know they could be distorted and everything but, you see, I really am sure that happened.” You have to resist that temptation because there are so many cases we know, including the tape of the girls that we just saw, where people are entirely sure things happened. And finally, you can’t trust some of your memories."
893,psychology,psyc-110,lecture-9,"Guest lecturer Peter Salovey, Professor of Psychology and Provost of Yale University, introduces students to the dominant psychological theories of love and attraction. Specific topics include the different types of love, the circumstances that predict attraction, and the situations where people mistakenly attribute arousal for love.","I’m delighted to introduce the first guest lecturer for this Introduction to Psychology course, Dean Peter Salovey. One is prior to being dean and in fact, still as a dean, he’s an active scientist and in particular, a social psychologist actively involved in studying health psychology, the proper use of psychological methods to frame health messages, and also is the founder and developer of the idea of emotional intelligence, an idea he’s done a huge amount of research on. And it is a topic that lends itself to many social psychological phenomena. The other thing I will mention is that there is a certain androcentric and heterosexual quality to much of the social psychological research on romantic love. But let’s start with a definition of love. And Sternberg argues that this is a required component of a love relationship. And that term probably works for you too, infatuated love, and this is love at first sight. “ But there’s a big confound, there’s a big problem in studies of those kind of relationships. So now you have a definition of love and you can now, as a homework assignment, sit down tonight and make a list of every person you know by the three elements of love and just start putting the check marks in the boxes and tallying up your personal love box score. We don’t even want to see those but you can have fun with that. You’ve probably heard the phrase “Birds of a feather flock together” and that’s true when it comes to romance. There may be other variables at play but, all things being equal, similarity does not breed contempt. You will see a stranger across a crowded room. Those are big, easy to observe in various ways in the lab. I can show you words in a language that you don’t speak and I can flash those words to you very quickly and I can later repeat some of those words and mix in some new ones that you’ve never seen before and I can say, “I don’t know — I know you don’t know what any of these words mean. And it turns out that’s not really the effect. Okay?You can see this with public figures. Half of them are assigned to the blunder condition. Now, they’ll usually just say, “We hired an actor. And it was the frizzy wig that everybody remembers from this experiment. In the condition where she was made to look attractive but gave you bad feedback about yourself, often the subjects in that condition would look for an opportunity to interact with her in the future, obviously to try to prove that her evaluation was wrong. I’m not saying this is fair, I’m not saying it’s rational, I’m not endorsing it, but empirically —  excuse me — empirically we can see it, that somehow the attractive — the feedback from the attractive person matters more to us. The one who didn’t really love you that much but then starts to show you that they love you, that person is a powerful influence on your behavior. It’s got two shots of caffeinated espresso. So what we have to do, of course, is take it in to the lab and do this in a more systematic way with random assignment. While you’re waiting please fill out this form.” The people who got the painful shock instruction are more likely to find the confederate attractive. The people who’ve run on the treadmill, even when that arousal is fairly obvious, you’ve got — you — doing a little bit of aerobic exercise, you still find the experimenter more attractive. So, these are essentially photographs of naked women. Maybe it’s about 10.So, these slides are coming up. But there’s also some very serious implications of this kind of work. So think about domestic violence situations and why people stay in them. I’m feeling — when he did that I felt something and I assumed it was love. So the question is in experiments like the painful shock experiment if you are told in advance, like you all are, through a consent form or by the experimenter, “This is an experiment involving painful shock,” will you still rate the experimenter as more attractive or will you not be able to misattribute the arousal?"
894,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-10,"Professor Brownell reviews the energy costs of modern food tastes. Specifically, he discusses how agribusiness and what people choose to eat has consequences on the depletion of water, land, and fossil fuels, and contributes to global warming. In addition, he considers whether food production and the earth’s resources can keep pace with the demands of global population growth, and whether we can enhance sustainability in our food environment.","I’m sorry I have to start off by apologizing; I have a cold, so you may get more coughing then usual today. Americans spend less money per capita on food than people anywhere else in the world. Can production keep pace with population growth? But this is more typical of what modern farming is like. This has changed the character of modern farming in the United States and has some upsides in terms of productivity, but some downsides as well, and has changed the relationship of the person who owns the fields to what’s grown in the fields. This graph that you’ll show, shows the number of gallons of irrigated water to produce one kilogram, a little more then two pounds of four things, and I’m about to show you what those four things are. Now let’s look first at how much energy Americans use in general. Americans are certainly using more then their share. How does that compare with the calories going in? So you get to see how complicated the issue can become. Is that better than buying — better or worse — than buying food that’s grown unsustainably, but it’s closer by so you shrink the food miles?You can start to see how this picture, if one really wants to know, how much energy is involved in the foods we buy, it depends on a lot of things. Well, it’s starting to matter to people, so it would be nice to get a sense of this, but we don’t have the index yet, but right now people are at least thinking about it and thinking of the criteria that would go into it. Will we be able to produce this and at what point do the lines cross? The book on the left is much more accessible, the book on the right is very heavy in statistics. Two young men, Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis, looked to see how corn is actually raised in the United States and developed a very engaging movie about it, so if you haven’t seen it I urge you to, because they talk about what goes into making corn, but also what corn makes and the number of products it’s in. A lot of chemicals go into producing modern agriculture. By monoculture we mean raising one crop in vast acreages, so I’ll talk about biodiversity in the next class and we’ll talk about the state of Iowa as an example and how much of Iowa is occupied by either corn or soybeans, and a small number of variety have corn or soybeans, so this is monoculture. Now we talked about — we’ll move from pesticides to herbicides and talk about weed killers for the moment. I may have mentioned before that Monsanto — and I talked about herbicide as being one of their major products — they make a weed killer called Round Up. More application of these things are not what environmentally concerned groups would like to see. In this case this report talked about the environmental issues of livestock production around the world and what it means to our environment and to health and well-being. The global warming potential is really considerable. Now the way the rumination works in cows because of the world’s desire for beef and the vast number of cows being raised, the cows eat the grass or feed, or whatever it happens to be, and it goes into their digestive system."
895,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-11,"In this lecture, Professor Brownell asks whether modern agriculture is environmentally, culturally, and morally sustainable. First, he explores how genetically modified foods both benefit and hinder world sustainability, such as with the case study of BT corn, and contamination to different parts of the environment. Secondly, he discusses the issue of animal welfare and its relationship with sustainability by exploring how modern food conditions encourage the mass production of meat. Arguments for and against the way animals are raised and eaten are also reviewed. Finally, Professor Brownell identifies shrinking biodiversity as a result of the green revolution and highlights current efforts to combat it.","All right, so I’ll start off this class like I did last one, apologizing for my voice, not quite up to it’s usual place, but we’ll do the best we can. Are there any questions about the exam that people would like to ask now? In some cases there will be time during the class to repair the problem that you might identify; but at the very least, it’s helpful for the next class I teach, so please pass along that kind of feedback. There are some who care deeply about the animals they raise; there are others who care less about them. There was an article in  in 2006 that I thought was quite interesting here. That’s a lot of stuff going on with that particular tomato. There’s good, there’s bad as there is with any part of these sort of things, but it’s interesting to look at the two tomatoes as an example. Taco Bell has the same thing for the tomatoes that go on, so the fact that there is a market for these foods creates a market for those tomatoes and that’s how — but — and the only way to meet that need and meet that demand is create tomatoes with certain properties, and that’s where you get the differences between an heirloom locally grown variety and the mass produced varieties from somewhere else. That leads us to the discussion of genetically modified foods. As with anything else, there are going to be up and down sides. These are the top ten countries that grow genetically modified food and I’m going to show the — not the first number one, but all the other nine. Some people have estimated that 40% to 60% of all the foods we eat in the United States have genetically modified constituents in them. Now the people who have written about this, the people who are concerned about it, have said it’s mainly because of the muscle of the big agribusiness companies that have stifled debate in the United States and have basically went over legislators so that they don’t do anything to regulate against it. I’m sorry it’s not a little more clear, but I’ll show you this in another slide. Then that crop can be bred and that gene persists in the crop and when the corn borer eats that particular corn it dies. This, as you can imagine, depending on the cost, has some real advantages to the farmer and potentially to the environment, because you’re not spraying pesticides on to get rid of the corn borer. The question is: does the farmer on the right suffer potential negative consequences from the fact that he’s right next door to somebody using genetically modified wheat?There have been lawsuits filed about this from farmers claiming contamination by nearby genetically modified crops. This looks like the way you think chickens could be raised, and are kind of the childhood image that we get from storybooks about what a farm is like; but that’s only a small amount of the chicken that people eat. But it’s more typical to see this kind of thing, and these are called factory farms and these cages are called battery cages where the chickens are confined, they’re typically not let out of the cages and they — it breeds a whole lot of interesting behavior in the chickens. They say the liberal views have gone way too far on this. In the context of her writing and research for the book, she came up with some interesting statistics. You ate oranges but you didn’t squeeze them and get juice out of them. There are many, many varieties of potatoes around the world. There have been more then 5,000 varieties identified, but only one was identified — was adopted in Ireland. There is a move afoot to try to reverse this problem and some of the things that have been done here are ways that some activists groups have tried to counter the shrinking biodiversity."
896,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-12,"Professor Brownell reviews public health as a profession and explains how it provides a different framework, compared to the traditional medical approach, for tracking diseases and trying to prevent them. Specifically, he explains how public health focuses on community/population (vs. the individual) and prevention (vs. treatment) and discusses which may be better for addressing problems of diet. He provides examples of how different forms of prevention (primary, secondary, tertiary) and the epidemiologic triad are utilized to address disease in public health. Professor Brownell also highlights the importance of science and a public understanding of relevant issues such as standards of proof and various methodologies used in scientific studies.","I’m assuming you guys are all preparing very hard for the mid-term on Wednesday, are totally on top of all the material. Therefore resistant strains of bacteria develop. This has been turned around by public health. The protection of people from environmental hazards becomes an important part of that, so protection of people from water pollution, or from air pollution, would be an example. The prevailing theory out there was called the Miasma Theory, and that had to do with spontaneous generation. He wanted to find out where it came from, and so he did things that today we would consider pretty routine, but were really unknown at the time: he tried to trace the spread of it. In September of 1854, he convinced the community leaders to remove the handle of the Broad Street Pump and the Cholera problem stopped spreading. If you look at total cardiovascular disease; the blue line on the top, other diseases of the heart; the green line, coronary heart disease — and we don’t need to distinguish these from one another so much — and then stroke on the bottom line, you see that beginning in the 1960s and then proceeding through the current time there have been significant reductions in rates of these diseases and death from them. Okay, more awareness, so people may get help earlier if they experience symptoms. The differences between the traditional medical model and the public health model are quite profound. What are the consequences for the individual, and what are the remedies that will help the individual?The public health model looks at the population, in contrast. One is primary prevention, and the object here is to avoid the development of disease in the first place. What’s toxic in the environment that causes the disease in the first place? You could find groups that are vulnerable by virtue of living in poverty; or there are groups that are especially exploited I guess you could call, are targeted by industry that might be selling some harmful product that could fall into a host vulnerability kind of group. What are the environmental factors that are contributing? How much cancer is happening, how much heart disease, how much of this is related to diet? Is that — can you explain that by genetics? Some people work over here, and develop programs; so for example, there are plenty of people in my field who do intervention programs in the schools, for example. I’ll give you an example of — in a later class of a study that my colleagues and I did looking at the impact — in fact I think it’s in your readings — looking at the impact of soft drink consumption on health outcomes. Who’s going to decide?Well, that’s where you need an informed public and you need people to understand as much as possible about what’s going on in science, and that’s what I’m going to try to help foster today. Well, you can look to see how, let’s say cholesterol and smoking are related to risk for disease, you could compare what happens with males and females, so a study like this will take you partway down the road to establishing scientific certainty, but leaves a lot of things unanswered. If they were the same, and you were following the same group of people over time, then you’d have a longitudinal or a cohort study that I’ll get to in a minute. First, this is an association, it’s a correlation, but it doesn’t really prove causation. You remember I talked about the Framingham Heart Study. Let’s just say family history is one predictor of disease. Then you follow people — that same group of people over time and you can get a pretty strong cause and effect inference out of that. I’m going to point out this particular part here. This study sounds pretty good, high green tea consumption, 31% reduction in cardiovascular disease. Here would be an extreme hypothetical example of that. Let’s say somebody did an enormous study, nothing like this has ever been done, but did a study with ten million people and of the people who don’t eat that, three get the disease. In these, you want to control for as many confounds as possible. Let’s say you have four schools available to do this kind of thing. What does that lead us to in terms of trying to help people? Same choices but just different defaults. Using the U.S. Model, Denmark, The Netherlands, the UK, and Germany have this percentage of people who are organ donors. You could never get an effect like this and it would cost an absolute fortune to do it, or you can just change the default. You can see from the results here that huge, huge changes have come about and you can see that it’s very cost effective to do this kind of thing."
897,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-13,"Guest lecturer Dr. Timothy Walsh offers a glimpse into current psychiatric understanding of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. He takes students inside the psychology of an eating disorder and the medical and behavioral complications that patients may experience. Dr. Walsh then explores the issues behind diagnosing, treating, and understanding these disorders from the doctor’s perspective as well. He reviews the demographic, physical, psychological characteristics of typical patients who suffer from these disorders, and theorizes that the development of eating disorders comes from multifactorial interactions that make some people more vulnerable than others.","All right welcome everybody, good morning. We really want to make sure we get good work on these projects. Here are a few things to remember for the final project. He is a Vice-Chair of Academic Affairs and Faculty Development for the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University and has served some time as Chair of The Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University. He has received many honors and awards over his career, as you might imagine. I do give a talk every year to the first or second year class of med students at Columbia, and the talk I’m going to give you guys is an adaptation of that talk. A tangent: Anorexia, it’s a bad name, it really is literally not quite right. Well has the codes and the names for all the psychiatric disorders and it’s — as Kelly said, I’ve been involved somewhat frighteningly in the construction of these things, and the fear is people take this stuff much more seriously than they probably should. I was flat everywhere except my stomach when I’d binged, when I’d be full blown and distended, so I was bent over with each rib and back vertebrae outlined. I needed to use different instruments to induce vomiting. Now I double two electrical cords and shove them several feet down into my throat. My knees are calloused from the time spent kneeling sick. ”That remains thirty years later, one of the most compelling descriptions of what these illnesses are like, starting with anorexia nervosa and developing into what we now call bulimia nervosa. Now one of the things that’s worth knowing, among the things worth knowing from this is — and it probably wouldn’t surprise you is the stuff on the right side of the slide, all these physical things are seen in any form of malnutrition. One of the things that implies is that therefore a lot of what people with anorexia nervosa are struggling with, are the psychological and behavioral effects of starvation. This is a picture of a patient on our unit some years ago, you can figure — you can detect how skinny she is by the hollow of her cheeks and how prominent her jawbone is, but these are the soft body hard called lanugos, it’s on her cheek, it’s on the back of her neck, and it appears in some folks, not all, during anorexia nervosa. It does happen; it happens a lot fortunately. Everything’s parallel, they don’t make much testosterone like the girls don’t make much estrogen, but they get the real live illness. Still does tend to come from the middle-upper classes, though not exclusively. Typically, there are exceptions, but these are typically not kids who stand out as being troubled kids prior to this illness. It remains a relatively uncommon illness, fortunately. As I said, what happens to folks who develop this? That doesn’t-it’s very hard, there are all kinds of differences between these studies. The physical abnormalities I won’t detail but they’re the kind of — they result from the purging behavior. This illustrates just how prominent these behaviors can become. Now, it’s not that we don’t know something, and I’ll give you some illustrations of the things we know, but it’s far from rigorously predictive, so we go to a sixth grade class and talk to, get blood samples from all the girls and we know okay well these three girls are going to get anorexia nervosa. Whatever you may or may not think of  and the swimsuit issue, here’s the 1965 cover and the 1999 cover, and again telling you more then I probably should, this is when I was in your seat. I honestly don’t think so, I think there are a bunch of reasons — a whole bunch of — Kelly and I could perhaps discuss — I think it’s a bad idea on multiple levels, but it’s gotten to this point that people are starting to think what are the connections, and that’s a very interesting question, is what are the links between obesity and eating disorders? These are treatments proposed for anorexia nervosa. If you want to lose a pound you’ve got to create a caloric deficit of about 4,000 kilocalories. We need more data but the early returns are very encouraging. For example, this is a study that we did in our unit, people who are hospitalized with anorexia nervosa, seven weeks — this is the weight just in pounds, gaining weight we can help people gain weight on Prozac and placebo, didn’t help didn’t hurt, made no difference. One of the reasons to show this to you is you can get data to evaluate utility of interventions and you need data, otherwise you’re just making stuff up. One of the remarkable things is that for bulimia the data are different."
898,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-14,"Guest Lecturer Dr. Derek Yach, leader in global public health and current Director of Global Health Policy at PepsiCo, offers an inside look into how a member of the food industry balances the needs of the company, consumer, and public health. Dr. Yach offers insight into how PepsiCo is thinking about research and development as a key to transforming the company. In addition, he reviews emerging research and policy trends within the company, highlighting PepsiCo’s long-term research goal of delivering science-based health and wellness solutions that satisfy the minds and bodies of consumers. ","It’s my pleasure today to introduce our guest speak Dr. Derek Yach. Just to say that — you saw some of the OpEds. A second one is the challenge of hard times. The second is, in many countries, we face direct challenges. In discussion, we can talk about how we respond to some of these. I think one of the most important sets of notes recently from Margaret Chan, the head of WHO, was reminding us that few choices are highly sensitive to price. Instead, we need to think about a model that works better for the food industry where research yields results quicker than the cycle of pharmaceutical companies, but also starts building the case for some of the long term work. Well let’s look at some other industries. In terms of the nutrition challenge, I think we try and see this in very simple terms. For each of these, we will have quantitative estimates of where exactly do we want to go. The problem, as I said, is the food companies, that it’s very difficult to actually motivate your own board to put money into long term bets. Well, how do you actually move from that to being authentic and totally green? In terms of our beverages, all the stuff basically comes in lines that can only deliver what is called cold full or hot full. How do we even think about the fact that so many of our bottles are generic and there’s a large amount of material both in the plastic — so we have teams saying, well how do you actually dramatically reduce the plastic?We’ve even been to the motor vehicle manufacturers, to find out what is happening on the cutting edge of material science that’ll allow us to dramatically take some of the metal products out of our packaging. The more we change those, the more we find we become more attractive as a company. That’s the reason why I suspect many of my colleagues have been fearful about engaging either with academics or with NGOs in some of these debates. In terms of schools, probably the best example we have is the Alliance for Healthier Generation, where in the U.S. setting over the last two years 60% less calories have been shipped into the school system of 135,000 schools, and in agreement with The Clinton Foundation, The American Heart Association, and a range of others. They’ve been forced to the table to do it generally. Our work on undernutrition is gaining strength and one of the major groups we work with is The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition which is a Gates and Norwegian Government supported group who focus on micronutrient deficiency. How do you make those trade offs so that the public health benefit actually comes to the fore?Generally, I can’t say that in our company we actually have any level of hostility. It’s now up to us inside the company to make it happen. Have there been any trends?This is just a snapshot of the data for the last two years. We have plenty of time for questions now and I welcome you to ask him any questions you’d like and as you can see from his comments he’s ready for it all. First, I mean during the process it was not something I sought or even thought about. We know from work from Barbara Rolls and many others that they actually operate independently. First of all, I think that what portion size does — what nutrient profiling generally does is it actually doesn’t have — when you have labels on packs, my own view which is a personal and not a corporate view, is that the best benefit of having calorie labeling on every single pack — which is the route we’re heading towards — isn’t that it’s going to make a big difference on consumer behavior as much as on corporate behavior. We have raised the question about why can’t we jack up our R&D to make sure that in any multi-serve pack there are actual divisions in the pack that change the default option, that you’ve got to actively make a decision to go on to portion two or serving two, rather than simply have the ability to pour and eat, and eat, and eat, and eat?That discussion has started, and as I said, I’m quite impressed if you go to the shelves, to see how the 100-calorie notion seems to have taken off. That’s going to be a debate that we also need to address. And second of all how do you combine the tomatoes and olive oil in products?Well I think on the first, we’ve got to be honest about what we are and what we are not. It’s in pilot tasting in India and other parts of the developing world."
899,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-15,"Professor Brownell discusses how economic factors are a profound driver of food choices in both the U.S. and internationally. He reviews the history of food subsidies and how they have made the U.S. an agricultural force but simultaneously changed the current food environment and diet. Furthermore, Professor Brownell explores how economic incentives to purchase highly processed packaged, calorie dense, nutrient poor foods are increasing while incentives to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables are decreasing; and how this imbalance drives overconsumption globally. Professor Brownell also reviews how neighborhood factors and poverty affect access to foods and diet, the global food crisis, and discusses potential interventions to address how economics influence poor diet today.","Okay, I’d like to start off by getting a show of hands on something. Food prices around the world have increased dramatically, and one could speculate about what impact this would have on health and nutrition around the world. Let’s talk about income and what it means in terms of health and then we’ll talk about diet nutrition specifically. It’s not one or one, or two, or three or ten percentage points’ difference. The healthcare you have access too may not be as good. If we look at rates of hypertension by income, we find pretty much the same association. So that suggests that same relationship that I said before. As you go up the levels of deprivation from level one to level four, the likelihood of obesity goes up, in this very stepwise function. You don’t often see something like this in science, but these are just perfectly straight lines, if you will, and that tells us something about the power of the variable to affect what people are experiencing in their lives. If we block out certain parts of this we get the whole picture. They have the most calories per unit weight. The relative changes in costs are interesting. Sugars and sweets rose by this much where fruits and vegetables went up like this. What they did was they created a shopping basket of sample foods that a family might buy in a supermarket or a market, and they created a shopping cart of healthy food and a shopping cart of unhealthy food and they wanted to see how the two would compare in price. So similar to the numbers that I showed on that previous graph, it looks like something is happening out there in the world that’s making unhealthy food more appealing to people, more a part of their diet, than unhealthy foods. All kinds of speculation about this — marketing, the processing of more foods, heavy promotion of these foods to children, there are a lot of things going on, but economics are a player too and that’s what we’re talking about today. The local markets tend to carry foods that are processed. We found pretty much the case that is mentioned here, that in New Haven today — and this has been true over the years — access to healthy food is harder if you’re in a poor neighborhood. Here’s some data from England that’s just the same thing. First, small stores can’t buy in bulk, so they don’t really have much buying power that a major chain would. These people in the white neighborhoods, they’re more likely to have access to these kind of foods anyway; but when a supermarket goes into a black neighborhood, the number of people who start limiting the fat in the diet goes up. This would suggest that there is some public policy things that could be readily done to try to encourage full service supermarkets to open in inner cities in the United States. One is the prices go down because the large supermarkets can buy in bulk and they have all the equipment. If you look at the food guide pyramid that existed before the present one, there was a slice of the pyramid that was meat, poultry, fish and eggs. One can see where these two interests compete with one another. Nixon was President in 1973, so he’s one, and the other person isn’t somebody I would expect you to hear of, but if you’re my generation you would have heard of him, and his name is Earl Butz. This was a well meaning thing based on the real need. Then out here we have a much higher number, and it was during this time that the subsidies went into effect. Now Michael Pollan wrote about this in an article in in 2003. There are incentives across all parts of the food supply. Other things went up a little bit but those went up especially high. What I’m going to do is just play several of these, but there are more and I’ve provided the website if you’d like to go and hear other ones .That’s a remarkable statement: by 2017 the U.S. which is providing half of the world’s corn, could have to become an importer because so much of it is being funneled off for the biofuels. So economics are a pretty important player here and something really needs to be done in order to change economic policy and we’ve talked about some of the things."
900,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-16,"Professor Brownell offers an overview of the food marketing landscape. He asks how much of food marketing is there, what impact it is having, who it’s impacting, and what can be done about it, in cases of negative impact. He suggests that food marketing is happening in very large amounts in ways that parents do not have knowledge or control over, and that it is having a highly negative impact on kids. Professor Brownell then describes the many forms of advertising, reviewing the history of character licensing and product placements. He also explores how food marketing is occurring within schools to affect children’s diet, and what can or should be done about it.","Well, you might ask why I’m not excited about every lecture, but I am. I use this as an example of the perceptions that created by marketing and the reality of the nutrition. What you can’t see because it’s too small, is something called the goodness corner that General Mills uses. There’re interesting questions, and we deal with the issues of food marketing, but more or less, it comes down to what — how much of it is there, what impact is it having, who’s it having an impact on, and if the impact is bad, what can be done about it?We’re going to play a little game to see how much you guys know about food marketing. Okay come on up, okay come on up, you too, how about a third from over here? Okay, come on yes and you, and one more, okay come on up. Like if I showed you the Marlboro Man then you would say Marlboro Cigarettes, something like that, okay that’s it. Fruity Pebbles or Coco Pebbles are those things, okay. Now pay attention, if you will to how quickly they’re getting these things. Notice how fast people are getting the food related images compared to these things. Just remember this when its time to have your degree handed to you by President Levin. Because if people have that attribution that I’m strong, I can resist it but everybody else can’t, then you can make the claim that well, everybody else should be strong like me and it’s their fault if they’re falling victim to advertising; so why should I do anything about it?If you could calculate the number of people in the population that are affected by advertising, and then look from that to figure out how many people believe they’re affected by advertising, you’d get this sort of disjunction in all likelihood. You’ve probably heard some of these terms. Do you want your children to be exposed to marketing techniques that the industry itself calls these things? You know Tony the Tiger doesn’t have any life outside of its association with that kind of a cereal, and Ronald McDonald, as you’ll see, is one of the widely recognized icons in the world, so these are very powerful. So there are a lot of character licensing. People will come down in all places here. There are a lot of opinions on this, but this is the landscape. But you see lots of examples of this thing. There were tobacco ones that occurred, in fact still do occur in movies where characters are paid or the producers are paid to depict people smoking in movies. Reese’s Pieces, that’s exactly right, so that’s a blurry picture there but it shows the ET character with the Reese’s Pieces. Now this is an example of stealth marketing. It would be interesting to find that out. Yes it’s true that school systems are beginning to cut back on this. Do you believe that that is inherently bad to be exploiting kids by doing this sort of thing? Now, the school landscape has changed entirely. Now when I was a kid this is what the school landscape looked like if there was anything like this in the schools at all. Well the defense against this is that schools make money and that these kids can walk right by those machines, there’s nothing making them put money in the machines and buy it, but the companies say, if you really talk to them, that they don’t make an awful lot of money from the sales of the things in the schools because they have to split the income with the school. It’s brightly colored, it’s right there in their faces, and so you can’t deny probably that it has impact, or again, why would the industry do it?Now the industry for many years, the soft drink industry, and their trade association that represents them has said, we’re doing the schools good, schools are profiting from this because it pays for the soccer uniforms, it pays for the band trip, it pays for the debate team and things like that and to some extent that’s true. Again, I don’t know if this is current, but there was a time where kids would earn points by doing well with the games, and then they’d hit a certain barrier, and they would be told that you can get to the next barrier if you give us the email address of a friend. Here’s Ronald Reagan before he became President doing cigarettes. Now, the sports sponsorships are very interesting as well. Well we don’t know, but the obvious intent here is to make something like Cookie Crisp cereal seem like a good thing. What does that mean?Well okay, twelve vitamins and minerals, we’ll start with that. If I can reverse here, this Hungry Man breakfast here that I’ll talk about in a later class is an example of that, and then there is this Taco Bell one that I think is pretty recent that is the Big Bell Box, and if you look up on the left hand corner, packed with all your favorites, it’s the meal that’s made for men. The recommended total for the day is 2,000. It might have been in the news accounts, but I just don’t remember. What the plan is is to start beaming people advertisements specific to their location. The newest frontier of all is neuro-arketing: people doing research using brain imaging and other biological techniques to find out ways to more effectively market products. Well common sense says, yes it works, otherwise why would the industry spend money?"
901,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-17,"Guest lecturer Professor Rogan Kersh describes the politics of food and nutrition as they relate to obesity. He describes how the U.S. Government has regulated individual behavior in the past, specifically with alcohol, drugs, sex, tobacco, and charts the associated triggers that move these spheres from being purely private to subjects of public regulation. Professor Kersh then connects these public policy movements and compares the triggers to the area of food and obesity. He concludes by suggesting lessons from previous policy areas that can be applied to political action with obesity and food.","Welcome everybody; hope you all had a nice weekend. Rogan, as I said, has a view of this that nobody else has, and is an incredibly insightful scholar on this topic. Now I taught here, as Kelly said, for a bunch of years and I’ve continued on and off to teach. Let me start with four dramatic examples and then connect this to food and obesity. Well into the nineteenth century, rum was considered healthier, gave you that sort of medicinal kick going down. Well, consider that most personal of activities, sex. Then finally in the last generation, in your own lifetimes: a coalition of national and state political actors have mounted a serious and sustained challenge to the tobacco industry, resulting in dramatic restraints on what maybe some of you smokers here consider your personal choice. Today, you know this: America’s landscape is dotted with associations dedicated to all manner of social behaviors. Alcoholics Anonymous, Smoker’s Anonymous and so on. Washington Temperance Societies to help one another swear off liquor. This is a dark side of American public life. What matters in American political life, is that they pack real political power and so you see us starting to move again in all these examples towards a very different kind of realm. When the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, the WCTU, got 200,000 to 300,000 women involved in fighting liquor consumption — one of the first major mass movements in the United States, or indeed, any country’s history. Think Million Man March in our modern times. Instead of demonstrations, it sponsored legislation. That was an official medical term from a  into the 1920s. On demonization, both of industry and users, hard to say — hard to fix this exactly. I actually have a couple of research assistants at NYU who are going back systematically since 2001, and looking through popular culture references to find the turn from McDonald’s being this friendly happy clown, to something much more ominous and dangerous. There’s some real concerns that things that happen in courts, policies that actually take place in court, aren’t that — don’t last that long, they don’t endure as powerfully as a law that is made by the representatives of the we the people; but nonetheless, it is an interesting possible shift and may herald the kind of change in obesity politics as well. I find that an encouraging aspect or piece, but at the same time, you don’t see the kind of big interest group push that has — the past is only a guide, it’s not a blueprint to the future — but that has always been the hallmark of major change in American life around public health. Interesting question if you couldn’t hear it’s no mass movements, no people in the street, what about — I’m taking as implicit your skepticism — about what about us, we the people today, who exist mostly online, what about online movements and those kinds of changes? I mean, most of what we do on our computers is still very private behavior. The one example I can think of that actually — as I’m saying this and thinking aloud and perhaps dating myself — meaning in age not in some weird fetishistic way; self abuse can kill you I learned that from this study — the one example that may be contrary to that, is movements for internet privacy, ironically. But I can’t think of sustained political movement in this realm that takes place online. I’ll ask the question again if you couldn’t hear it. In fact, the reason we go through these kinds of stages in such enduring physean, i.e., push the rock up the hill only to have it roll down again, is because it’s so hard to bring about significant policy change in American life. It’s so difficult in fact, that for the last fifteen to twenty years, in the realm I know best public health, more and more advocates have turned away from the usual policy channels, elective branches, write your member of Congress, here’s a great idea for something I think is bad, make it happen. American politics and policy making is like a battleship around obesity and many other issues in public health. We are a people when we make policy and we do it more slowly because there’s so much interest group activity now. Ban Trans fats, well let’s at least give that a try, so lots of policy options and possibilities, absolutely, it’s an incredibly complex and dynamic and confusing subject, but if we don’t do anything obesity rates, we know this from all — every projection we have, we’re going to keep going up, and up, and up. Most European countries, particularly those in Northern Europe, Scandinavia are far ahead of us. If you haven’t heard this yet in here, I suspect you’ll hear chapter and verse. Japan, to give you one example you may have heard of, has required I think they’re still doing this, every single person in the country have something equivalent to their BMI measured and recorded. That’s a kind of solution that wouldn’t go — you couldn’t do it in this class, much less the whole country in our individualistic U.S.I’ll say for the last time, we are an individualistic country."
902,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-18,"Professor Brownell discusses the specifics of government and its role in people’s food choices. He explores whether and how government should play a role in people’s food choices. Professor Brownell highlights the American mindset which couples freedom with issues of personal responsibilities, explores how the framing of the issue influences policy, and proposes a more nuanced view. He then reviews what the current government does on the nutrition program front. He then reviews the three conditions under which business self-regulates, and suggests taxation as a potential government intervention, and a tobacco tax precedent.","Well, however you feel about the outcome, you certainly have to admit there was a lot of drama and so much lead in. Well, part of it is because of the topic, the politics of food, just like the politics of anything happens quickly, can change on a dime, and all these breaking developments happen that are really very interesting. One thing I wanted to mention is, you’ve heard a lot about the work going on at The Rudd Center throughout the course of the semester. Then we have to ask these other kinds of questions when we decide whether government should be involved. There are a variety of dimensions on which this battle occurs. See if you can tell us which quote goes with which person. You might think, at first glance, that the Surgeon General and the top health officer in the United States would have a different view of the issue than would the present — the person who represents the restaurant industry, which has been accused by a lot of people of contributing to the obesity problems for various reasons. Then there’s sort of the pragmatic view of this, is okay if you believe in the personal responsibility ability approach, what roads does it lead down in terms of public policy and are those productive paths? The people who have written about this have basically talked about these as its main components. If one were to do a systematic analysis of opinion pieces written by people who embrace different frames, you would see these themes come up time and time again. Number one here is very important, that freedom gets coupled with issues of personal responsibilities. In the class we’ve gone through all these sorts of things. To ascribe it totally to personal responsibility would be pretty hard to defend if you look at the science. That has led down a role where government has been fairly inactive, has had weak programs, and hasn’t really taken this on as some people think they should. Does it have to be dichotomized in such a clear way that you see happening in the press a lot?Well, here’s how we come down on it, and this doesn’t necessarily mean this is the way you should, but it’s just the way we have chosen to reconcile these competing frames. It’s a personal problem to be sure, poor diet leads to personal problems, leads to medical problems, but it’s an issue. Freedom is also enhanced if you’re healthy. Let me explain a little bit more of the history of that then was in the OpEd piece that we wrote because it’s very, very interesting. They talked about this expert panel, which was a great panel of esteemed scientists from all around the world. So here two elected officials putting pressure on appointed officials, the heads of these powerful government agencies to pressure the WHO to change its recommendations, and then you can see what else was listed in this letter. Several things occurred then to expose this. I’m going to play you an interview that was aired on an ABC Special where the former news correspondent, Peter Jennings, interviewed Tommy Thompson and basically is asking Thompson, do the subsidies really affect health and what should be done about it? Back when we talked about the food guide pyramid, I probably made the case — although I can’t remember if I did or not — but I probably made the statement that it almost doesn’t matter what the food guide pyramid is, because you could take it and then create the exact opposite of what the standards are now, and would it matter? Well no, it probably wouldn’t matter at all. So little changes in your day to day life are going to help you deal with the obesity problem, and that will help America address the obesity problem for the population in general. You have to wonder about the small steps program. It would be pretty hard to argue now, I believe, that government is playing a very active and constructive role in this problem. This is happening in spades in the whole food arena. Well, these are the three primary ones, at least that I see. This was initiated at a 2006 meeting in Oslo, Norway that I attended. Now we did a quick pass through this over at The Rudd Center the other day, and what we did was we looked at the criteria that the Smart Choice Program, the industry generated program, had used to define nutrition in cereals. There is a precedent in the tobacco arena. That came from changing the law and putting in a tax. If a tax is done in this kind of way, potentially it would have beneficial effects. The OpEd that was in your reading that I wrote first on this was in 1994 in I didn’t choose that title because I don’t think it’s very appropriate for what I said, but the basic idea was that raise taxes, generate money, earmark the revenue for anti — for healthy nutrition programs, and then you might get somewhere in public health. If you look at that and blow it up it’s interesting."
903,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-19,"Professor Stephen Teret discusses how public health strategies and policies can address obesity-related issues. Specifically, he explains how gun violence prevention and motor vehicle related injury prevention can inform multi-level interventions for childhood obesity. In addition, Professor Teret also draws from his own experiences in public health and litigation, and offers advice on what to consider when selecting policies to protect the well-being of populations.","Good morning everybody, hope you all had a wonderful weekend. I first got to know Stephen at a meeting with The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation put together on issues of diet, nutrition, and obesity. I think that I’ll probably focus more on trying to address childhood obesity than obesity in general today. Stephen pushes a button on the side of the Beretta, and that button discharges the magazine — remember that the magazine is what contains the bullet — and Stephen puts the magazine, the bullets back up so he now has the handgun, the pistol without the magazine in it, and he says to Ross, let’s go out and play. The pattern in public health is called the epidemiology of these events. What we as public health people try to do then is to come up with ideas about how would you prevent something like this from happening? But not all suggestions are going to have equal effectiveness. The person is already carrying the gun or possessing the gun. You can walk into the supermarket, you can walk into the convenience store, you can buy whatever garbage you want no matter how obesigenic the food is, but we’re saying to the people once they’ve done that, but please be careful about eating the food, that just doesn’t make sense to me. Marketing may buy you some more, we market food to kids — I don’t know if you’ve already have lectures on marketing of food to kids, but that seems like something that’s imminently well regulated or could be — isn’t well regulated now, but could be well regulated. This math teacher taught us about — he said think of the Triborough Bridge. Think of the beginning of a venn diagram as being the universe of people. Kelly said I used to be a lawyer, I was a plaintiff’s trial lawyer in New York State and I decided that I wanted to go to public health school and work in the field of injury prevention. I don’t know if people know what Legos are anymore — you know what Legos are — so we’re playing with Legos, these little building blocks that you put together, and I go, Michael do you smell something burning? You could have these magazine disconnect devices that I mentioned to you so the trigger is pulled, the event occurs, but a bullet doesn’t come out of the gun; I’m not going to go over all these things. The purpose of The Haddon Matrix is to allow you to think through all kinds of interventions, and it doesn’t really matter if Kelly says it goes in one cell, I say it goes in another cell, what matters is that we thought of the intervention. There were rulers of countries outside of the United States who would invest in the United States railroad industry, but the railroad industry has not done well, as is the case with many other industries, and Levitt’s argument was because the railroad industry was myopic. If it realized that it was in the business of transportation, the railroad industry could have become also the automotive industry, the airline industry — parenthetically neither one of those are doing too well right now — but they were when Levitt wrote this article. When we come up with public health interventions, policy interventions, they may be interventions that other people don’t like. So you could have as your policy objective educating the person who feeds the child if you want to, as your public health goal. We tried to get airbags in cars by having Congress mandate it. Politically that was very difficult to do. I told you before that lawyers are good at dividing by three; $1.8 million divided by three is some large number — told you that I’m not good at math — so lawyers know that’s a hefty fee, so as a result of that and the publicity, there was publicity among lawyers, there was publicity among the public, I got to go on The Today Show because I was the person who wrote the article in , and talk about this kind of thing. You will be relying upon the police powers of the states. You should plan on that from the beginning. We need to think about these things because we have so many problems. It takes long time to solve these problems, but they’re not going to be solved without these kinds of public health heroes and those public health heroes I hope, will be you."
904,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-1,"Professor Brownell gives an overview of the course agenda. The psychological issues of food are introduced, such as who defines food, what promotes health, and how the food industry contributes to both debates. The biological issues that will be discussed include how people’s hard-wired preferences interact with a modern food environment. The political issues of the class will integrate food production, consumption, marketing, and world politics, with discussion of potential interventions for changing food preferences and food intake patterns in society.","It’s really nice to see you all and I appreciate you getting up so early in the morning. One even might go so far as to say that it could be a controlled substance. Who has taught you and other people in our culture what food is all about? Well these are very interesting questions. Well maybe three-quarters of you, a lot, that’s a lot. Somebody else had their hand up?A lot of interesting reasons, we’ve all heard the topic — the word chocoholic, sugar addict, we hear the words withdrawal and things and that becomes an interesting part of the biology of food. How much is psychology, how much is biology, how much of it is world politics? We’ll talk about whether food can be addictive, as I mentioned just a moment ago. And there are three properties of this diet that help promote overeating and obesity in laboratory animals. Okay, fat is number two, so you guys are good so far. So the fact is those lab animals have a hard-wired preference for foods that are high in fat and high in sugar, primarily because of the energy density that those foods bring to one, and then the variety is important because you get a mix of nutrients. There’s a very interesting political history to that. So if we asked you which of these two things is food, I can imagine what you’d say. You’ve been totally trained by your culture. Okay if it’s ‘something you can eat,’ okay well that makes a cockroach food. Well the cockroach is pretty much its natural state and you have all the ingredients in the other food. Well then we get a check for the Cheetos, does it taste good? So you see how these different properties of food affect whether we would even consider it a food. The distance to food has changed a lot because food has to come in from far greater distances than used to be the case, and that’s changed our relationship with food a lot, into a distant rather than a close relationship. Yes, and somebody else had their hand up. Less cleaning, to take care of the dishes and you can just throw it away. Now what you might do about this, let’s say that we — that you’re the Surgeon General or you’re the top health official in some country and you agree with this poll, that people are eating too much junk food. But if this is the reason, it’s what people like to eat, what would you do about that? Well, we’ll sort through all these and discuss what a society might do to help change food preferences and food intake patterns in the society. We have to ask ourselves which of these is true. And in here, there’s a very male-dominated theme that you’ll see pretty quickly, and what you’ll see in this is that this man is being told, and men who watch it, obviously a male-oriented sort of thing that I’ve seen watching sporting events and the like. The man is in charge of his dietary destiny. He’s making his own decision as you said and no woman is going to tell him to eat quiche or tofu and that — you may have missed it but in the song there — we’ll show this later in class again — but in the song they say that ‘I won’t eat quiche anymore’ and ‘goodbye to tofu’ and things like that. Talks about that food is more important then family. What about how fast the sort of lack of control and now I can kind of binge on it or eat it, I don’t even have to wait until the family sits down to eat. So to imply that now you can eat all you want, you have an issue to free ticket if you will, some people might consider not the right message. This is more alarming then you could ever imagine."
905,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-20,"Dr. Marlene Schwartz discusses the topic of food policy in schools. She presents the history of federal regulation of the National School Lunch Program, the debate about competitive foods in schools, and describes research on influence of school food on student nutrition. She describes Rudd Center research conducted in collaboration with the Connecticut State Department of Education on the effectiveness of policy changes at the district and state level. She also shares lessons from her personal experiences as a parent advocate in her own school district and describes how her volunteer work in the community informs her academic research.","I was just curious, how many of you guys would be up at this hour anyway if it weren’t for this class? Factors like the size of the portions, how much is in a container, the shape of glasses and things like this that end up in the press a good bit, so you probably about his work already. Marlene is the Deputy Director of The Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, and in that position has a key role in establishing the direction of The Rudd Center and coordinates essentially all the activities of The Rudd Center. What I’ll be talking about today is a little of history about regulating school food. Those are all competitive foods because they compete with the full school lunch. They proposed that any food offered at school, during lunch, could only be sold by the program. They introduced this concept of foods of minimal nutritional value, which is a term that you hear a lot when you start really getting into the trenches with the school lunch. They fall into candy, soda/water, frozen desserts, and chewing gum. In 1980, the USDA decided that these foods of minimal nutritional value, which include soft drinks and candy, were prohibited anywhere in the school until after the last lunch. In 1984, they finally said that those foods of minimal nutritional value couldn’t be sold during the meals, but they could be sold before and after the lunch period. What do you think is a food of minimal nutritional value? Now I’m going to give you a sneak preview of your speaker on Monday, Brian Wansink, because he did a study which has actually been very influential in my own thinking of how to change the school environment. Again, this was just another way of documenting how the environment can really significantly change the way kids are eating. He was also, and this is really important, able to show that he could reduce the number of students who developed Type II Diabetes. She’s another just really charismatic, high energy person who has taken this on and done what many thought was really impossible, which was to change the sourcing of where the food is coming from in school lunches, making it as healthy as possible, and showing that children will in fact eat that food if it’s served to them. This actually included a lot of things in terms of changing the food they had; they’re changing the contracts with vending machines, but the part that got the most press was this controversial BMI report card, which is they had each child get weighed and measured at school, they calculated their BMI. These are my three kids Anna, Molly, and Charlotte. When I heard that, I was like oh no, I’m sure you should not be afraid of the parents, because I’m sure that most parents feel just the way I do. Then I got the ‘Come on birthdays are only once a year. Then came the really hard part, which was having to walk the walk. Of course my daughter wants to bring in cupcakes. We did do some research, both with the Connecticut data and a colleague of mine, Chris Wharton, reviewed the literature from other places that had tried out these programs and found that schools that make changes like this on average do not lose money and this is a really, really important thing to be able to document. What happens is most times, it’s as though the kids say of fine I’ll just buy the school lunch since there’s nothing good over here with these snacks, and so your lunch sales go up. This is really a win, win because the nutrition is going to improve, the amount of federal reimbursement the school’s going to get from their higher level participation in the school lunch program is going to improve, and I think it’s definitely a beneficial thing, but it was a leap of faith for these early food service directors to try it and find out that indeed that’s what happened. Every district in the country, and so obviously every district in our state, was required to write a School Wellness Policy which had to include certain components. First of all it had to be created by a committee. I was sort imagining here in Connecticut, we have parts of the states that are very — parts of our state that are very wealthy and I thought of them having these really great policies and then other cities in our state that are really low economic areas where I was worried that they just wouldn’t have the ability to focus on this as an issue and they would end up with worse policies. So it was a pretty nice sort of incentive for them. As a state, this kind of gives you an overview — on average as a state the state didn’t do particularly well. I have not heard of universities looking at this from specifically a nutrition perspective."
906,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-21,"Dr. Brian Wansink explores the topic of how people can move from mindless eating to healthier eating. He identifies five myths that contribute to overeating, and suggests how his research on eating cues provides potential ways to intervene against people’s mindless eating patterns. He then describes the future direction of his research.","Delighted you guys all found your way around to the new entrance for today which was not easy, given that it’s hard to find your way into this building anyway. Well you see this how as time is going on. This is what I think we might see in the 2025 if projections continue. If there was miraculously somebody who did know about it, it certainly didn’t get them to make the decision to change the way they eat, or how much they eat, and if even they made the decision at Time T, at Time T + 1, it didn’t really have any impact on action. The reason I talk about this is because at the end of the talk we’ll come back around to something that we’re working on, something we call the small plate movement, which is an example of one of the things we’re trying to move out there to make — put some points on the board with respect to this research. I’ll show five myths that pretty much mess up a way a lot of us eat. We’ll go in there and we’ll alter the music, or we’ll alter the TV show that they’re watching, see how that might mess up what happens. You can just imagine how happy people were to hear about this for ninety minutes. When they got to the end of the counter — to the end of the table, somebody gave them a questionnaire — that is a meaningless questionnaire — that had them write down who do you think is going to win the game or some — we didn’t even really care. I’m way too smart to be fooled by a bowl. This is Mount Prospect, a western suburb. One of the things we did though is they were — people were given — half the people were given good popcorn but the other half of the people were given terrible five day old popcorn. Poor Yoric, I knew him well!Then she says the government needs to do something. Break it into two smaller size bowls and put those in your party. The number one answer was, ‘I know I am through eating dinner when I’m no longer hungry.’ One of the things we did was we simply over the course of six weeks we took a bunch of recipes and we gave them descriptive names, descriptive labels, or we just called them their normal name. What we did is we decided to do the same thing with wine, because we noticed in another study that if you put a really fancy label on a bottle of really terrible two dollar wine, people think it’s a lot better than it is, but we wanted to see if it had a referred impact on the rest of the meal a person eats. It’s just kind of interesting is — when I was doing this, one of the researchers in my lab kept walking and saying, and he said this like fifteen times, any time we’d say it, he’d laugh and go, hey some wise guy put a cork in my wine bottle! Anybody know where that comes from, the famous person who said that? According to this it probably works okay. What we did was we intercepted a bunch of people, and there’s like six studies in here but this is just the coolest one — is the first one and we ended up intercepting a bunch of people when they left McDonald’s and Subway, and we asked them how many calories do you think you ate?Now the typical person in this sample eating at McDonald’s ate about 700. Big bowls, if that’s a problem use smaller bowls. What we did is we randomly assigned them to one of twenty changes, one of twenty tricks that we or others had found worked in the lab. If they did it on Tuesday they could put a check for Tuesday. Kind of what was happening here was a very commonly recommended thing is to eat a hot meal, like eat oatmeal as a hot breakfast alternative. I was saying to myself, oh Lord let it be a gun! Now we could say, what would be the next steps? Then there are two other big things we’ve got to look at also and one ended up being restaurants. We’ve done a study that shows that if you take an all you can eat restaurant, we did this really cool study about Chinese buffets that just came out, but we — in another study we show that if you look at restaurants, the all-you-can restaurants, the typical person will over serve themselves on a large plate, but they’ll also end up throwing a lot — they’ll throw a reasonably high percentage of the food away."
907,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-22,"Two guest speakers share their experiences in changing the food environment in their local communities. Melina Shannon-DiPietro describes how the Yale Sustainable Food Project changes people’s connection with food at Yale and reflects a growing national and academic trend. Jennifer McTiernan describes the development and goals of CitySeed, highlighting the power of individuals and communities to make change.","I can imagine you’re all bleary-eyed and exhausted from staying up late to work on your projects. It turns out that this is one of the nicest days of the whole class for us, because we get to see the product of all your creativity, and just judging what I’ve seen so far, and what I’m sure we’ll see when people turn in things after the class, it’ll be an amazing array of projects on a variety of things. What are people doing in their local communities to really make a difference?It so happens, New Haven is a place where a lot is going on, and some of the most creative programs anywhere in the country are happening here. Two of the people who run such programs are going to be joining us today. She spent some time farming in Sicily and in Maine, taught history in the Maine Coast semester and did a variety of other teaching and academic enterprises connected to agriculture and farming before coming to Yale. I’m going to talk a little bit about the Sustainable Food Project and what we do on Yale’s campus and beyond. The way I think about doing that is that we are creating a generation of leaders here at Yale, and we want sustainability to be part of their everyday practice. Institutions purchase a lot of food every single year. Yale’s grocery bill is about $8 million dollars. We’ve gotten lots of input from staff and students since we’ve been doing it and we started really small. In 2002 it was — there was no sustainable food in the dining halls. In 2004 it was 10% and 2005 it moved up to 20%. In terms of impact on students, this principle of making sure it tastes good, was one thing that drove us and we were successful with. There’s nothing like working with fresh raw ingredients to really make a cook happy. Some of them are saying, I’m going to go work for the best chef in New York; others are saying I want to study regional cheese production in Southern Spain; still others are going to Kenya to think about food systems there; or to Rwanda to build gardens for patients with Aids who are nutritionally deprived; so there’s a whole variety of ways that people are dedicating their lives to this work. The other thing that I think is exciting here is that courses related to food and agriculture are really growing. You can check out the website if you Google eat-in, check it out online, there’s a national movement of eat-ins starting. One is you can sell fancy pants sort of anything; our seasonal goat cheeses, heritage breeds, and you sell them to a niche market. Right from the start, the community really embraced this idea, this idea they could connect directly to a farm; that the line from field to plate would be straight and short. You could in fact bring them to a Farmer’s Market, hand them to a farmer, and walk away with your bag of fresh produce, but once they went onto a credit card, this EBT card, farmers couldn’t do anything about it — until about 2005.We have this hand held terminal that we use at the market, it’s a credit card machine, and folks can come and use food stamps, and it’s worked out really well. I’ve been using that term; let me give you a definition. It is the combination of industries that bring food products from farms to your table. That includes the production processing, distribution, sales, purchasing, and consumption of food products. When you’re talking about a community food system and you’re talking about building an equitable local food system, which is part of our mission statement, you’re looking at all of the aspects of this food system and trying to translate them into what they mean for the community members. I’ll tell you actually that The Rudd Center is one of our workplace sites, and so since 2006 we have been supporting the viability of a market in a low income neighborhood by selling full price shares and delivering them to workplaces in New Haven. Building that infrastructure I would argue, is the next big challenge for the local food movement. We’ve also worked state — on issues at the state level, two of them in particular. There are programs through which one could obtain a paid summer fellowship or internship, and we are always excited to have students interested in these issues, engaged in our work. I remember somebody saying that there was a child who had never really used a fork and things like that. I think this is — some things are culturally, we have to contend with is where our priorities are. One, which we haven’t talked about but we both brought this point up before which is that — I’m not sure it’s the case with the fair trade bananas — but with lots of things, local foods simply taste better, and that’s part of the story. I just want to give one example, there’s a new head of the school food program in Baltimore and — Tony Geraci and he has made the argument he’s actually preparing a bid to source all of the food for the Baltimore school system from local farms, and he is making the argument that it will cost him less. Part of the issue here is how much do people care about these sorts of issues and do they care enough to pay more? Some people will care a lot about these issues, some people will care a lot less."
908,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-23,"Professor Brownell concludes the course by exploring the question of how to change the food environment. He identifies health, environment and social justice as three broad reasons for changing the food environment and highlights the need to unite these initiatives. To address the questions of who creates change and how it happens, Professor Brownell explores top-down change and bottom-up change. As exemplars of both types, he reviews the issue of menu-labeling laws and identifies people who have inspired big change through local action. He then ends by summarizing what his goals have been for the course throughout the semester and highlights the need for innovative change on a variety of levels.","As you guys know, this is the last lecture. We’re going to finish up today by talking about success stories. We’ll talk about how a lot of the principles that we talked about in the class have been put into action in real world settings by some very inspired people, and they’re quite interesting stories. They basically fall into three categories. This is the ability of an individual or an institution to get people who ordinarily wouldn’t be interested in the topic interested in the topic, and then bring in their professional expertise or their personal passion to the issue, and that makes a lot of difference. Well, the fact that they got deputized into the cause, the fact that these were all people who used to pay attention to other issues but now are paying attention to food issues can really help a lot because they have new perspectives, new ideas, victories they’ve won in other arenas that can now be applied here. Then finally, organization and science can be part of it. If you’re organized you can — or you have people work with you who are organized, you can really pull off a lot, and that just means you’re more effective. The question is, who creates change and how does it happen? In the state of Michigan there was the Adventist Church — was established in 1854, shortly after that it changed names to The Seventh Day Adventist Church. It grew in size from that little place to a much bigger place, and then a much bigger place after that, and became a very prominent institution in the United States. The Post and the Kellogg companies are quick to boast about the history and about the prominence of these people, and how they got started with cereals and healthy foods and things like that, not sort of realizing the irony that these two people would probably be appalled if they saw what was being sold today under their names. I know it has to do with this: the food environment has changed a lot from the early days. One way would be to work down here and that’s to find the things that are having a negative impact and try to change the situation by moving the dots over here. The other way to do it, would be to focus up here in this quadrant. Of course sometimes global action might create this sort of a thing. The perfect example of the American arrogance has to do with the environment, America not signing the Kyoto Treaty, and things that a lot of you guys know about. There are some people that have made this possible. You may see, if you go into a McDonald’s outside of New York where the restaurant — where the menu labeling isn’t required little pamphlets sitting somewhere, maybe a poster on the wall, and so they — or it’s on a website, so they say we don’t need to put it on the menu, people can get it anyway, and we make it available. So parents who band together to try to get better foods in schools would be an example of this. Also, of course, if people are doing these things in their own communities they own change. Now you can’t really see so much from this, but you’ll see from some other pictures that this Martin Luther King Middle School is a mixed race, mixed social class middle school in Berkeley, so it’s not sort of upper crust Berkeley by any means. I’ve never seen kids so well behaved, so engaged with what they were doing — it was really quite amazing. So this inspirational person Alice, really helped turn the environment of this school around. The concept here, and here’s a quote from Alice, it’s a little hard to read in the back it says,“Right there in the middle of every school day, lie time and energy already devoted to the feeding of children. She has the power, the passion, and the ideas, but she’s had persistence as well. Then what she did was she had this garden, had a tent, and had a table there. I had my camera with me, I took a few pictures of sort of things like this, and you just got this sense from being there that there is this beauty, majesty, joy of food that Alice talked about in that quote, that should be shared with our children. Back to the Edible Schoolyard, this is the building that they built off the schoolyard where the kids take part. and so these sort of pictures are kind of the stereotype of what people thought the south Bronx should be. So another example of somebody making a real difference; again, made possible by the inspiration of one person. All examples of projects that have become nationally famous, internationally known, have become examples for other people making change — all made possible by one person. Both are important, both can be effective, both have to come together to do this. Let’s go back to our original slide and look at what has to be done. I hope you also have some appreciation for food victories and food failures. You guys are going to be in a position to change it; every one of you will be able to change it one way or another, if you choose to do it."
909,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-2,"This lecture explores how the mismatch between evolution and the current food environment has changed people’s relationship to food. Ancient societies had a vastly different food environment compared to modern day societies, which was characterized by unpredictable food supply, the threat of starvation, and a high priority to bank energy. The human brain evolved for this ancient food environment, which creates challenges in the modern food environment where people have unfettered access to the high sugar, high fat, high variety foods that they are programmed to find appealing.","Is this tolerable for you guys, bright and early in the morning like this? I’m going to talk about some class logistics and I’ll talk about the course website which you’re welcome to visit. Everything should be pretty self-explanatory and if you have any questions you can just contact me or ask me questions after class. First of all, there are two ways to get to the course website. Second, well we’re not getting to the second one; let’s see what — okay as I mentioned the lecture slides will be posted almost always the same day after the class. I mean I’m not going to try to trick you or throw in things just to make sure you come to class, but it’s usually a pretty good policy. What I’d rather have is your interpretation of things like I thought this thing was really interesting and here’s why, or I remember back in week two of the class we talked about this issue and it links up with what we’re now talking about in week eight, or I just saw something on the news and here’s how it relates, and all those sort of things are the way the concept sheets go. That will give you insight into how these studies are done on diet and health. If you guys want a seat there are plenty of seats over here scattered about. They’re not due — the first one’s not due until next Monday or Wednesday, so you can pick any three days to do it during that period of time. What made things go so awry that people and food used to be more in sync in terms of health and well-being, although there were problems in some ways. In different parts of the world you would see this sort of activity for finding food. There’s never any question at all about whether one can eat. You have somebody like this who would be frightened to death about getting the food; and you have somebody over here who has a completely different relationship with it. I’m not sure if the Yale Library has this or not, but if they don’t you could ask the librarian to get it. Iif you go back to this particular graphic, the interesting thing is how have humans changed and what are they like now. So a completely different way humans are interacting with food. Now these parts of the world are shrinking in the number; but let’s say you lived in Ethiopia or Somalia, or places where food really is scarce way too much of the time, then having this particular biological drive, having a brain that wants you to seek out these foods would be highly adaptive. Now if you think around to the people you know, you probably are aware that there are pretty important differences between people and how much they eat, and then how well those calories get banked. People do that with differing levels of efficiency. Satiety, or the feeling full, having enough, being sated gets trumped by the presence of food. So it makes sense from an evolutionary point of view. Fat has twice the calories per unit weight that protein or carbohydrate sugar has, as a consequence, has the greatest survival value. Now we’ll talk in a subsequent class about what the ideal diet is. Honey was the one place where it may have come from, but of course, now there are lots of ways to add sugar to things, and sugar is everywhere and added to foods you wouldn’t expect. Our hypothesis is that in the United States it’s less expensive to sweeten things then it is elsewhere in the world, and part of that is because of high fructose corn syrup that we’ll talk about later in the class. This is one of the most striking findings. The question is: why do people eat so much? If you change the animal’s environment and you give it access to these sort of foods, and these are the pictures that I showed in the first class, and you remember I asked you what constituents of this diet promoted obesity and you said it was fat, sugar, and variety that was correct. Or are you going to say that that will only take us so far, and it’s the conditions that are messed up, and we have to do something about the conditions to make it easier for people to make healthier choices? Now one could say that there’s something peculiar about the — biologically about the Pimas who live in Arizona, who put that — makes them so much at risk for diseases like Diabetes. Think about how grossly things have changed starting in those earlier times. These are very profound changes, and it has led to the humans that we are today."
910,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-3,"This lecture focuses on how people measure nutrition and what it means for health. Professor Brownell reviews methods to track food intake, from a population level to an individual level, emphasizing methods and measurement error as well as portion underestimation. The definition of a calorie and how it is measured are also discussed, as well as people’s changing relationships with macronutrients and micronutrients in food and with water.","How many of you have started off the dietary assessment and tried that out? So for example, the Jenkins article that I have listed up there was one of the readings for today, and they talked about what food does metabolically and they talked about studies that would show, for example, that some foods have a different glycemic index then other foods and they would affect metabolic outcomes like Hemoglobin A1C. I don’t expect you to learn that, or even retain it unless I explain the concepts in class, or unless they’re explained quite well in the paper itself. I’m going to do a few little quizzes today where we’re just going to do a show of hands, but beyond that, the clicker will be helpful. We’ll talk about difficulty people have in understanding what a portion is. So either you guys were listening or you know a lot. Alright, how many of you would say a low fat diet is best? If we defined food differently: that it’s something that nurtures the body, something found in nature, something that doesn’t harm the environment — there are a number of criteria one can apply to define a food — then we might come up with a different definition than this, but this is the way the nutrition field generally looks at it. So nutrition is really what people are eating; and that overlaps with the concept of diet, which is when people are making specific choices about what to eat, how do they partition their nutrients. Do they eat a lot of carbs, a lot of fat, whatever they happen to eat. One is to look at how much of these foods are produced. And so then you have to recollect everything you ate in the last twenty-four hours. How often do you have this kind of fruit or vegetable? You’re essentially doing a diary; you’re keeping track of what you’re eating. Now my guess is that only a fraction of you are really doing that. Now we have very good biological measures of some things. Now Susan Mayne, who is a Professor here in the School of Public Health, has done some very interesting work with an electronic device that can be passed over the palm of your hand and measures pigmentation in the hand as a way to assess vegetable intake in people. And so that not remembering becomes a problem. Then a variant, by the way, of number one the falsifying things, is whether the record-keeping itself is reactive. Now when I asked you to start keeping the dietary records, I asked you not necessarily to change your food intake because we wanted you to have an accurate record of what you typically ate. Now this is a little counterintuitive, because very often people underestimate the amount of calories in things, but what’s important here is the — the error, the size of the error. I mean they were underestimating the amount they were eating so it was — it worked in — it made them look better then they were actually doing. In one case, overestimates and in the other case, underestimates. Now, you know, take your hands and kind of do that and you can get a sense of how small that really might be. Both have nutrients, both have things your body can make use of. So how many calories, and how much fat, how many grams of fat would you say are in the following foods? On The Border is like a Mexican chain restaurant. Okay, I hope you don’t rush out of here and go for the paradise pie. If we look at our different foods and we look at the calories and the fat and how it all stacks up, here’s what you get. So it’s very easy for people to exceed dietary recommendations given what the modern food supply is. Those video clips I showed in the last class were evidence of that where they talked about the sensual properties of fat. As a consequence, the body can draw on these stores. And so there are good things you can do with nutrients by fortifying foods with them. But of course, there can be abuse of these when the food industry puts stuff in foods it doesn’t really need to be there, and then they overstate the value of them and we’ll talk about that, what’s reasonable and what’s not as we go through the class. But people think they need to have water with them all the time. So that’s how you get a sense of these numbers. Something terrible has happened with the American diet and it’s not just happened in America, but country after country, after country is changing to follow America’s example. Focusing on one nutrient is a losing proposition, according to some people, but there are others who say that, nope some nutrients prevail over others and are highly important compared to other things that you might be concerned with. A lot of you were forming ideas about food and nutrition during the Atkins craze, and my guess is a lot of you care a lot of carbs in the diet: pay attention to them, look at labels about carbs and things like that, and if you bought into the Atkins philosophy, it means that you’re less concerned about fat then you are about carbs, and in fact it’s okay to eat a lot of fat as long as the carb intake is reasonable."
911,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-4,"Professor Brownell reviews the challenges inherent in research assessing the link between diet and health, and the challenges of basing a diet upon different dietary recommendations. Fundamental information on nutrition is presented, as well as how our current diet suggests we are eating too much or too little of different classes of sugars and fats.","All right guys, welcome back after the weekend, I hope you all had a lovely weekend and a nice time. Somebody told me, by the way, that the sample concept sheet that we have listed on the website couldn’t be downloaded, so we’ll fix that, but we’ll also send you out by email a sample concept sheet, along with guidelines for how to prepare them. And three will mean you did a really good job that will be top grade. Okay, well maybe a dozen people at the most. One is that 2 000 calories is the average for the typical person, but of course, people have greatly differing calorie needs. Men will need more calories than women, people who are very active will need more then people who are less active, etc. Other things that you think might make it difficult to be accurate with those? Okay, so 2500 calories one day; 1400 another. There are three classes of sugar: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. The glycemic affect is the extent to which this blood sugar effect occurs when people consume certain foods and then the glycemic index is just a number that gets attached to that. Let’s show you graphically how this might play out. Now when you want to maintain good health, high peaks, high spikes in blood glucose and the insulin response that provokes is not a very good thing, and so the red line is a far healthier way to be than the yellow line is. So, as I said, there are many graphs around many charts of the high and low glycemic index foods and some things would surprise you. In this process, the margarine becomes less healthy. Again, when you see that partially hydrogenated oils on an ingredient list, that means there’s Trans fat. Well, it changes the food in ways that are commercially appealing for the industry. So factors such as exercise, or smoking, or other things like this that are relevant will be measured and then the scientists will look at the impact of something like diet on health while controlling for the other factors, controlling for the impact of the other factors, so you can try to isolate the impact of the thing you’re interested in, in this case diet with — on the outcome of interest, let’s say heart disease or cancer. The epidemiology studies are what a lot of our information comes from. I’d like to give you examples of three of very famous epistudies on diet and health: The Framingham Heart Study, The Seven Country Study, and The Nurses’ Health Study, and then we’ll talk about some of the overall results from these sort of things. But Framingham is famous for this heart disease study. Another famous study was called The Seven Country Study done by a researcher at The University of Minnesota named Ancel Keys. This is done by researchers at The Harvard School of Public Health. From all this we can conclude several things. There’s one particular issue with overnutrition called the metabolic syndrome that I’d like to talk about and show you a little data on. For women, the good news is that that fat below the waist tends to do less physical damage than the fact above the waist that men more often have. Again, I’m not expecting you to remember all the details of this but I’m going to show you this — when you put all these things together, it’s called the metabolic syndrome, and I’ll show you some data on its impact on health. I circled this P [ .001 over here that’s a — if any of you have taken statistics will know what that means, but it’s the statistical term that tells you how significant these findings are. Women became very upset about this and advocacy groups like the breast cancer advocacy groups got involved and really pressured the government to do more studies on women. It tends to be a better predictor of how much body fat a person has then just using their weight and I’ll talk more about body mass index in a subsequent class, but it’s basically weight over height squared in metric units, so it’s weight in kilograms over height in meters squared, and you come away with numbers in the teens, the twenties, and the thirties, and then if people are very heavy they can have higher body mass index then that. Like somebody, for example, who has got extremely low weight might be that, and that explains part of it. Then you can look at the number of calories per — from fat that’s offered in the food,Now, daily values are established by the government, how much nutrients the typical person needs and then how much — what percentage of that a food provides. The mere fact of labeling Trans fat had a big impact on the food industry wanting to take it out. You’ve got things like grains and fruits that we know people should be eating. Then the things on the right are pretty self-explanatory. Well, there’s kind of general advice on this that’s born partly on science but partly on philosophy of eating and foods and things like that. If there’s — if you wanted a guide on how to eat healthy, this would be my favorite choice, would be the book Willett,  but there are others that are good as well. Lots of agonizing went into what sort of a graphic to create to do this. If you want to draw upon a higher power you’ve got lots of choices there too. There’s the Butterfly Diet, the Astro Diet, the Go if you’re like this you can do well with that."
912,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-5,"This lecture addresses the complicated relationship between biology and eating. Professor Brownell explores the physiology of taste and eating. Many parts of the body are affected when people eat food, and many biological factors affect what people choose to eat, how much they eat, and the way they regulate their body weight. The experimental methods used to assess how body weight is affected by genes are also reviewed.","Let’s talk about biology and eating, an incredibly interesting yet complicated topic. We’ll talk about more of the biology today. Some years ago I was talking to a person who worked for M&M Mars, a big candy company of course, and two of their biggest selling products are Three Musketeers and Snickers candy bars. See I was so worried that we had so much to do today that I forgot to boot this up. All right, so let’s see if the technology is correct. Then of course, these other things are very important as well. Hunger is pretty obvious, satiety refers to how full a person feels and when eating shuts off once it starts. We’ll talk about energy balance in the body and how body weight gets affected, the genetics of these things, and then we’ll end with this discussion of something interesting called taste aversions. That got picked up by scientists, including Bartoshuk, who started looking at this and have this used this compound, the PROP, in many, many interesting studies. You get this interesting sense between 25% of the population looks like that, 25% looks like the top slide and you could see how people — to the extent this is related to food preferences — how the tongue people are born with, and there’s probably related physiology elsewhere in the body to that, how that’s going to affect what people eat. Bitter vegetables, like broccoli and cauliflower for example, are experienced as very bitter by that 25% of the population, the supertasters. There are signals — or I haven’t had enough and I need to eat more and these central signals that stimulate or inhibit eating are — fall into that category. You can see how these things are affecting food intake in feedback loops to the brain. We talked about blood glucose last week when we — or on Monday when we talked about the glycemic index. I’ll talk to you a little bit about how the Munchies is being marketed, and Frito-Lay has several different messages on the bag that make it look like its going to be a healthier product for kids, and that there’s something, somehow good about this compared to the normal things. If you eat the same thing over and over again, even though you might really like it, you’re only getting certain nutrients, you’re being deprived of others, and hence, the body sends out this signal that hey I’ve had enough of that stuff it’s time to move onto something else. That’s the sensory specific satiety concept and it’s been studied a lot over the years. There’s a researcher at Penn State named Barbara Rolls and I’ll discuss some of her work later on in a different context, but she has done some terrific studies on sensory specific satiety. In fact, one thing that people notice when they come from poor countries to the U.S. of how many choices we have of a given food. Is this a reasonable thing for a company to do? Weight is driven, as you know, by energy balance. If you ran a marathon how many would you burn? Overall, the amount of physical activity people get as a function of overall energy expenditure is not as much as you might think, but important, very important, I don’t want to underplay that, but these other factors are very important as well in determining what people weigh. Now you guys have probably heard of this concept, you’ve seen charts with it, you may have calculated your own body mass index or — plenty of places you can do that on the web — and you can get a sense therefore about what this means. So these lines are almost straight but there is some curve in them. Let’s just take a couple of data points as an example. It’s good for lots of different reasons but that would be one of them. Well it’s affected a lot by behavior of course-how much one eats. There are different methods for studying the genetic contribution to anything. First, you can do animal studies where you can actually go in and measure genes, you can do that in humans of course too. Or you can manipulate genes by breeding animals to be a certain way. First, there are ways you can breed obesity and in this case there is a laboratory strain of mice called the OB/OB mouse that’s bred to be obese, so you can look at the genes that are doing this. Here are more examples of that kind of thing. These have been used for years in laboratory studies. So this would suggest that there’s not a very strong relationship between the parents who raised the children and the weights of the adoptees; whereas you get a different picture for the biological parents. Now my guess is that if we had you write down what those foods are it would highly different from one another because these things tend to get conditioned in by happenstance."
913,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-6,"Ashley Gearhardt gives a guest presentation about the relationship between food and addiction, and how emerging clinical research suggests that eating maps onto a model of addiction. Professor Kelly Brownell reviews how culture affects eating, from what’s acceptable to eat to how to eat it. He reviews cultural differences between the American and French food cultures. He then suggests how American values are changing through recent movements which are concerned with the story of food and the features of food before it is consumed.","Today we’re going to talk about culture and how remarkable eating — how remarkably eating is affected by culture. I’m going to be speaking with you today a little bit about food and addiction, and I’m going to give you an idea of what we’re going to be covering in today’s lecture. What would it mean to be addicted to a substance? If you think about this a little bit, the consumption of substances is actually quite widespread. But it continues to grow, and grow, and grow. When you’re looking at the brain of someone consuming a drug of abuse like cocaine or see it consuming something like a milkshake, you’ll see that this area of the brain lights up in response to this very rewarding and pleasurable activity. Well, this is where the research is really becoming new. In looking at this, to translate this into excess food consumption and obesity. We see something similar with sugar, that when you’re around queues that are associated with you consuming calorie dense foods that the body starts to prepare by insulin release, to reduce the glucose in the blood. This is a little bit to do with what I talked about earlier with the body preparing for glucose. There will be physiological changes and they’ll begin to crave the alcohol because the body will want it to normalize the changes that it just undertook. It could be sugar, it could be fat, it could be the combination of those. First, it talks about a little bit about our difficulty in changing the obesity epidemic. You received an email that mentioned a little bit more about the concept sheets. Okay, so let’s do this one first .Okay, that’s one very common experience, when people come to the U.S. from other countries they notice a number of things about the American food supply and several of them are — were captured here, but the more prominent one was the portion sizes. The other thing that people are amazed by in the U.S. are choices, as I mentioned before, how many versions we have of different foods in a supermarket. This is one experience from a person who came to the U.S. Let’s look at a second one here .Here’s another example of how — what people will eat within a culture is determined in part by what they have access too and the relative cost. The fact that food gets viewed as a commodity, as something that people just have to have access to rather then something that’s necessary for life, can be enjoyed, can be part of the family fabric and things like that, gets lost in this commoditization of food that really has happened in our culture and she captures it in that quote, so she’s a very interesting thinker on this particular topic. One interesting figure in here is a psychologist at The University of Pennsylvania named Paul Rozin, and of course one of the papers that were assigned this week was by Rozin. I just bought them this morning on my way to work. Now Rozin, Rozin has done studies and I’ll show you several examples. Of course you know what was on the plate. As I think I mentioned before, the doggy bag is a peculiarly American concept, and if you go to most other countries not only will they — the term doggy bag not translate but the concept doesn’t translate, because they’re used to serving you the amount that you need at that meal, and you’re not going to take any home. How then food can become an enemy rather then a friend. Some people believe that in the United States we have a perverse relationship with food, and that’s not true around the world. Things like war and people becoming refugees, changes the food patterns in very large numbers of people. There’re two separate but connected movements that I’d like to talk about. Other people have picked up that banner and carried it high and have done it in a very effective way. How much vitamin, whatever, does this food have? That’s all part of our culture and he’s arguing for changing that. Okay a fair number, how many of you have seen Supersize Me? It was kind of scary picture and people would look at that, read that book and say, I’m never going to eat fast food again because it’s unfair to the workers, the animals are being raised in terrible conditions, it’s not nice to them and this sort of feeling of disgust arose in a lot of people as a consequence of reading that book, and changed the way some people felt about fast food. So these are alarm oriented, concern oriented things that are coming out, coupled with this movement toward a more positive view of things that represented by Pollan and Alice Waters."
914,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-7,"Professor Brownell talks about the situation with world hunger and how it is measured. He reviews the world distribution of hunger, from how many people are affected, to the physiological, psychological, and behavioral consequences of starvation. He reviews how geopolitical issues affect the world food systems in different parts of the world, including climate, war, disease, and refugees.","As you know, I’ve shown in most classes some comedy clip, something amusing toward the end of the class or at the end of the class. Now not too many of these showed up on objective tests. Now when people go on diets the body doesn’t recognize that, well okay I’m trying Atkins because I want to lose five pounds, all it knows is that your body is not getting its usual number of calories, and that signals a protective defense and that’s what this is really all about. The people collectively remembered that some wallpaper paste was made from potatoes. Here are examples of those to give you a sense of how the concept of food insecurity is defined. Now we’ll come back to this later in the class when we talk about economics and how the cost of food and the relative cost in our culture of healthier and unhealthier options drive people towards certain parts of the food supply, and what that means for diets of the poor. Okay, trade policies from the wealthier countries adversely affecting the poor countries, could be a real player. Then these particular nutrients carry with them a series of particular biological problems when people suffer from deficiencies. There are several visible manifestations of hunger, not only wasting away and having people who are extraordinarily thin and malnourished, but there are several things that you tend to see a lot in pictures and so I’d like to describe what these two conditions are. The slide gives you several examples of this. Poverty, of course, is an obvious driver and I’ll show a slide in a moment that shows the world distribution of poverty. What’s going on in this part of the world? Some people have speculated about this and part of it has to do with climate zones in certain parts of the world, and the relative wealth that varies across the world. You take areas like the highland and the desert parts of the world, you have much less of the land area for the highland groups, so that’s only 7% of the world’s population so we won’t factor that in so much. I mean, when I was a child we were told to clean our plate because there were starving children in China is what they said at the moment, and so even as far back as my boyhood, there was public concern about hunger. Well let’s talk about what it is and then what it has accomplished. Maybe we are, it really depends on your perspective. And in this case Malaria which was a terrible killer there is down a great deal in prevalence. And then in case you — of course you get your share of celebrities who are involved in this particular as well. Some give money and their time and visibility to it. Well, first attacking poverty has to become the cornerstone of this remediation process. The diseases that you see here are communicable diseases, infectious diseases, and those things can be remediated if there’s the will to do it. Of course the most important thing of all is getting the world to care. Families often endure this hungry period on single meal a day, sometimes nothing more then a forged handful of grains. Here’s one — let’s get going here, sorry I’m not sure why this one’s not loading so well. Well this is turning out to be an unsatisfying experience, isn’t it?"
915,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-8,"Professor Brownell talks about the situation with world hunger and how it is measured. He reviews the world distribution of hunger, from how many people are affected, to the physiological, psychological, and behavioral consequences of starvation. He reviews how geopolitical issues affect the world food systems in different parts of the world, including climate, war, disease, and refugees.","The topic today is the nutrition transition and global food issues. This in turn affects diet, it certainly affects body weight. The global picture is changing to be sure. We’ll give you some examples of that today. As I mentioned before in class, very often when people come to the United States — in fact one of our students in the videotape mentioned this before — they’re amazed by the number of choices and by the size of things that they were exposed too, but people come to the U.S. and they see a hundred different salad dressings in a supermarket, 50 different yogurts, cereals that would fill up a whole aisle with dozens and dozens of choices. There’s some research done in China showing that when families secure a motor scooter — which is more and more possible because of the increasing wealth in the country — the likelihood of people being overweight in the family goes up. Now people pay to exercise in several ways. This is a chart that shows the leading causes of death in rural China. There will be some sense of that in an audio clip I’ll show you. You’ve got some very large differences, but pretty high numbers overall. If we take obesity as one of the diet related diseases and ask where it’s increasing the most, you get a chart that looks like this. So there are places in the world that face significant issues with this. The health authorities are concerned about this greatly. That statistic that you see in the bottom bullet point, that the mean age of strokes and heart attacks were ten years younger in China than Australia gives some sense of that particular biological vulnerability. First it shows some of the human beings who are affected by this; it talks about the potential healthcare costs of this in a country like India. But it covers certain things and other things it doesn’t, and they’re — embedded in this conversation that we have, is a trap that America fell into, and it’s possible that a country like India will as well and it’s the idea that you can treat these problems away. Now in the United States, the traditional approach — and we’ll cover this when I come back and do a lecture for you guys on the issue of public health and public health models — the traditional approach in the United States, when there is some kind of a disease that affects health is you treat it and the typical model that we hope works for many diseases would be like an ear infection in a child. Not necessarily through medical care but through public policy that can have a beneficial impact. It used to be the case that poverty drove people towards certain local food selections, which were fine for the most part. You get a very clear picture in this scene about how dire the problem is of obesity and poor diet. After he did this, he spent time in Geneva at the World Health Organization and then more recently has returned to Finland and he is Minister of Health for the country, but a very interesting player in this whole picture and he has helped change to some extent the way the world looks at intervening with these problems .That’s one key about this project in North Karelia that Puska ran: that not only are they focusing on the individual and education, and the sort of typical change people would think about; but he’s talking about intervening in the environment and making changes. The sodium intake has gone way the heck up."
916,psychology,psyc-123,lecture-9,"Professor Brownell discusses what the green revolution is and how it has impacted the world scene in both positive and negative ways. On one hand, the green revolution has increased world food productivity and decreased world hunger; on the other hand, it has produced negative environmental effects and failed to benefit all countries involved. Professor Brownell also reviews the green revolution’s technology advances including different kinds of irrigation systems, fertilizers, pesticides, and biotechnology, and describes the future of the green revolution in Africa.","Okay, let’s talk about the green revolution. He was correct in noting that hunger was going to be a problem, but not for the reasons he thought. So this is quite different then what Malthus projected and the question is why. It so happens, as I’ll talk about later, that Africa is the part of the world least touched by the green revolution, so some problems definitely need to be solved. Today we’re going to talk about the definition history, what the green revolution is, and then its impact. We’ll talk about both sides of this issue. These are the ways, the primary ways that the green revolution has sought to do that. Irrigation becomes a very important issue when you can greatly increase in certain parts of the world the amount of crops you can grow by irrigation. Here is a picture of him later in his life. Increase the use of fertilizers, for obvious reasons that has the same set of concerns that it generates, but the same set of opportunities. The goal is to do these things and here is where the word yield comes in, but the world yield has a number of different components. Here, an example of tube wells on Pakistan on the left and Bangladesh on the right. There are a lot of places where the water just evaporates into the air. Now, lettuce in Arizona is not as important to the health of the country as growing some sort of a vegetable in a poor country would be, where they absolutely need the agriculture and the irrigation to survive. And so the irrigation becomes more important to some areas then another. Large use of its water for irrigation takes place. Then people can come to their own conclusions about whether it’s worth it or not. These kind of calculations have been long part of the farming system; people understand what they are and try to do the best to yield cost-benefit. I know at least a couple of you have told me that you grew up on farms, and it’s very interesting to learn about that kind of thing and how scientific it really has become. There is some hope that you could genetically modify crops to increase the nutrient yield from them. Here would be an example in China where there are treatment or genetically modified versions of the rice next to control versions, so the non-genetically modified rice, so that would be the T and the C. You see here, and in a very nicely done experiment, where you have one set of crops grown right next to the other — it’s a controlled experiment — you see the higher level of green and therefore yield and productivity in the ones that are genetically modified. The overall impact of genetic modification of rice has been 28% higher yield, just from this one particular genetic modification of the BT gene. The golden rice, in particular, is important for these reasons. Here are a few other examples with other crops on how productivity has increased. The yield has gone up, and up, and up and that’s a pretty impressive increase, and this is in the developing countries where you’d most need to see this kind of thing. Large increases in the world food production. There is talk about the fact that the world has limited land that could be used to raise crops and we might be approaching the maximum use of that. Let’s just say corn goes into feeding the cow, or other grains too, but let’s just take the corn as an example."
917,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-10,"This lecture introduces biblical law in a comparative approach that identifies similarities and differences between Israelite law and other Ancient Near Eastern legal traditions, such as the Code of Hammurabi. Distinctive features of Israelite law are explained as flowing from the claim of divine authorship.","So as we saw last week, before we stopped to talk about the priestly materials and the Holiness Code — as we saw last week, the covenant ceremony at Sinai included God’s announcement of and Israel’s agreement to certain covenantal stipulations. And so they tend to be dated tenth-ninth century in their written form. But these sources themselves are clearly drawing upon much older traditions. They have a great deal in common with Ancient Near Eastern legal traditions, generally of the second millennium. So given at Sinai, now this is on your sheet, you have the Decalogue — not very well translated as the Ten Commandments — we’ll come back to that. It tends to be general and somewhat undifferentiated. So it seems to be addressing Israelite males as the legal subjects in the community. It probably should be seen as an ideal number, an effort to find ten statements in there. And we see the fact that ten doesn’t work very well in a very interesting phenomenon, which is that the so-called commandments are actually numbered differently by Jews and by Christians and then even within the Christian community, different Christian denominations number the commandments one through ten quite differently from one another. They disagree about what is number one and what is number two and so on. The first statements, either one through four or one through five depending on your counting, but the first group of statements concern Israel’s relationship with her suzerain, with God. So evidently, there were different traditions regarding the contents of the Decalogue. I should also say that we would do better to understand these materials as legal collections and not codes. So you’d be very hard pressed in the extra-biblical collections to find a law like Exodus 23:4 and 5:When you encounter your enemy’s ox or ass wandering, you must take it back to him. When you see the ass of your enemy lying under its burden, and you would refrain from raising it, you must, nevertheless, raise it with him. It is the will of God, and God has something to say about all areas of life. Again, that refrain always has to come with this kind of a statement. And you compare that with the extra-biblical collections and you see quite a difference. In the Hittite laws as well, Tablet 2, 197-198, the husband can decide to spare his wife,If he brings them to the gate of the palace and declares: “My wife shall not be killed’ and thereby spares his wife’s life, he shall also spare the life of the adulterer and shall mark his head. The Laws of Lipit-Ishtar in the prologue: “establish justice… banish complaints,” I like that one, “bring wellbeing” — promote the common weal and welfare. So the laws that are presented in the Holiness Code are introduced with this exhortation, which you don’t find in other places. But I’ve listed them there under “features. It should be the impetus for moral action. If anyone maims his fellow, as he has done so shall it be done to him: fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. They’re neither let off lightly nor punished excessively. Even so, and this is not to apologize for it, there is a tendency toward humanitarianism in the laws concerning slavery. The Bible, again, equivocates on this question. No Israelite can be enslaved to another Israelite. So it’s actually done away with as an institution altogether. Other evidence of the trend towards humanitarianism is the lack of legalized violence in the Bible. The citizen may do what he wishes as he feels the distrainee deserves. So I’ve put this very handy little chart on the board for you listing codes on one side. Remember if it’s an accidental homicide, there is a leniency in the law that that person can run to a city of refuge and remain there until the death of the high priest. So I have to suffer the literal punishment, as a father, I have to lose my child. In the Bible, the extension of  to all free persons, regardless of class, expresses the notion that all persons are of equal value."
918,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-11,"This lecture, focusing on Moses’s final address to the Israelites and transfer of authority to Joshua, describes Moses as the paradigmatic leader of biblical tradition. The structure of Deuteronomy is then outlined.   Attention is given to updated and revised laws within Deuteronomy which exemplify the activity of adaptive interpretation of earlier tradition. The main themes of Deuteronomy are presented and include the notion of God’s chosen people and chosen city, social justice, covenantal love and the centralization of cultic worship.","You may have heard that post-biblical tradition hails Moses as ancient Israel’s first and greatest law giver; and certainly the Bible depicts Moses as receiving law from God and conveying it to the Israelites. The collections as a whole clearly date to a much later period of time — and we’re going to see that clearly when we talk about Deuteronomy today — and they have been retrojected back to the time of Moses. But nevertheless, Moses is the central figure in the biblical narrative, from Exodus all the way through Numbers and into Deuteronomy. Perhaps it’s Moses’ failure to follow God’s instructions to the letter when he is producing water for the Israelites or demanding water: perhaps that’s what angers God. After a very poignant scene in which God shows Moses the Promised Land, from a lookout point on the east side of the Jordan River, we then read about the death of Moses in Deuteronomy 34:God spoke to Moses on that same day. “ Moses crosses the Reed Sea, the waters stand in a heap, and the children of Israel cross over on dry land. Moses had a vision of God at the burning bush. He was told to remove his shoes, his sandals, because he was on holy ground. So no greater praise can be given to an Israelite leader than to be compared to Moses. Moses in this sermon is giving a historical review, and the purpose of this historical review is didactic; he wants the Israelites to learn something, to infer something from this review of their history from Sinai to the present day. In Chapter 27 we have a covenant renewal ceremony. And this is all set out in a speech in Chapter 30. Deuteronomy refers to itself that way in Deuteronomy 17:19-20. Now there’s a lot of debate over the precise timing of these events and this process by which this material grew and was expanded, but in the post-exilic period, at some point, the entire unit, the Genesis through Numbers material, Deuteronomy, and then the lengthy historical narrative, all the way through 2 Kings, was solidified. The complex process by which Deuteronomy was formed underscores the fact that modern notions of authorship cannot be applied to biblical texts. And so we refer to those who transmit and develop a text in this way as a school; but you need to understand that we are using that in a relatively informal way. They have different concerns and different foci in their presentation of that material. Now this term, the scroll of the Torah, as I said, does not occur in Genesis through Numbers; it is a phrase that occurs in Deuteronomy, in Deuteronomy 17. So this is evidence again that what Josiah found to base his reforms on was something like the Book of Deuteronomy: it’s Deuteronomy that contains the prohibitions of high places and so on. Possibly this material was then worked into a larger scroll, given its Mosaic introductions and so on, and that all contributed to Josiah’s reform. The best exemplars of these treaties are the treaties of the Assyrian emperor Esarhaddon. The temple is always the dwelling of his name. And that’s very different from earlier texts where we’re seeing a sort of a cloud encased fire and so on. It’s to be proclaimed and read aloud to the people, on a regular basis, every seven years. Another key idea that occurs in Deuteronomy is the idea of Israel as the chosen people."
919,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-12,"This lecture concludes the study of Deuteronomy and traces the contribution of the Deuteronomistic School: a historiosophy according to which Israel’s fortunes are dependent upon and an indicator of her fidelity to the covenant. The books of the Former Prophets are introduced with attention to their historical and geographical context. The book of Joshua’s account of Israel’s conquest of Canaan is contrasted with scholarly accounts of Israel’s emergence in Canaan and formation as a nation state.“Palestine in the Time of Saul.” Atlas of the Historical Geography of the Holy Land. Smith, George Adam. London, 1915.Courtesy of the University of Texas Libraries, The University of Texas at Austin ","I was talking last time about the concept of election or choice, God’s choice of Israel, Israel as the chosen one, which occurs for the first time in the Book of Deuteronomy. And I was talking about the fact that for Deuteronomy the election of Israel, God’s election of Israel means or entails the idea that Israel is a holy people, holy in the sense of separated to God — that root meaning of holiness which means to be separated from the common or the ordinary. On the contrary, he emphasizes, it is only because the wickedness of the Canaanites is so great that the Lord has to drive them from his land, and now he is giving you a chance. Some have suggested that this is quite purposeful. It also is driven very much by a secessionist account of Judaism as being something that was moribund at the time of Jesus. So it certainly reached its final form in that period , as did Deuteronomy, and the Pentateuch probably generally. Many sections of P do not seem to assume a central sanctuary. We are going to see that when we get there. Sometimes they challenge and contradict one another, but they are not best seen as linear, as telling a neat, linear story about Israelite religion flowering and fading. And those features and assumptions have a lot in common with the book of Deuteronomy, a lot in common with the book of Deuteronomy; and that is what led the German scholar, Martin Noth, to surmise that Deuteronomy and these historical books really form a unit, so that Deuteronomy not only looks back and finishes off the Pentateuchal narrative, it looks forward as the beginning of really the historical account that is to follow. J, E and P really seem to come to an end here; there is some debate about this, but because the interpretive history that runs from Joshua to 2 Kings is based on ideals that are set out in the book of Deuteronomy, we refer to the person or the persons who redacted this whole unit as the Deuteronomistic historian, or the Deuteronomistic School. It assumes and insists upon the centralization of the cult. That was when King Jehoiachin was released from prison in Babylon, in 562. It is making an argument and it’s attempting to communicate the meaning and the significance of the events of that time, and it does so through a pattern, a literary pattern we will see, of reward and punishment. The other thing we see in the Deuteronomistic material is a preference for Judah, the Southern Kingdom, as compared with a very negative presentation of the Northern Kingdom, Israel. So the northern kings are going to be uniformly denigrated. And in the ancient world, the reason for this was that this very small rectangle — ;it’s about 150 miles long and 70 miles wide, about the size of Rhode Island — this very small rectangle lies on the way to anywhere worth going in the Ancient Near East. The central mountain area, those are between 4000 and 10,000 feet above sea level. The area around the Sea is basically semi-desert. We can really divide it into two major parts. And it is not until King David, 200 years later that, in fact, we will read about the capture of Jerusalem. These are mounds which represent the successive layers of destroyed and rebuilt cities. And archaeologists for a long time were convinced that they would find these destruction layers. And these people are spoken about in a lot of our ancient sources. The word “Palestine” comes from this, Peresta, Palesta or Philistines. And these are thought to be Israelite, especially because they appear in places that the Bible identifies as strongholds of Israel. This practice, which I mentioned before and is known as  or the ban, is not unique to Israel. They are attempts to explain the fact that there are lots of Canaanite groups included in Israel; and we need to understand and explain that reality as much as we are conveying an ideological account in which all Canaanites are obliterated or destroyed. In 24, the Israelites are assembled at Shechem to renew the covenant, and Joshua recounts God’s mighty deeds on behalf of Israel and exhorts them to choose whom they will serve: Yahweh, who has done all of this for them so undeservedly, or the gods of those whose lands they are settling in. The ban on intermarriage here is quite specific."
920,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-13,The transition from a tribal society under the leadership of elders and eventually charismatic “judges” to a nation under a monarch is traced through the books of Judges and 1 and 2 Samuel. Early stories of local heroes are woven together into a larger history that conforms to the exilic perspectives of the Deuteronomistic School. An extended look at representations of Saul and David (including God’s covenant with David) reveal historical shifts and some ambivalence about monarchy and the ideal form of leadership.,"One thing that kept cropping up , and it is something that crops up every time I teach this course, and I should always say something about it preemptively, is just a terminological issue. So the second half of the Book of Joshua — so the first half recounts the conquest, and then the second half recounts the division of the land among the 12 tribes, who, it is claimed, were descended from the 12 sons of Jacob. It is pretty much the same list that is in Genesis 49. And so instead of the Levites, we find that there are tribes named for the two sons of Joseph. And it seems that only in extraordinary cases would you have the tribes acting together, perhaps by decision of the tribal elders. But superimposed upon the authority of the elders is the authority of certain inspired individuals. And we will turn to the Book of Judges now. And chapter 1 gives a detailed summary of the situation at the end of Joshua’s conquest — taking stock, listing the extensive areas that Joshua had failed to take from the Canaanites, despite the impression that is given by the Book of Joshua (certainly the first part of it) that they did everything they were supposed to have done and fulfilled the commandments to Moses and so on. I am condensing all of this.…When the Lord raised up leaders for them, the Lord would be with the leader and would save them from their enemies during the leader’s lifetime; for the Lord would be moved to pity by their moanings because of those who oppressed and crushed them. He is also known, his other name, if you will, is Jerubbaal. You know, he can lift up the gates of the city. So you can see in a way how these stories were fodder for the Deuteronomistic editor. It is happening for people for whom all of this is ultimately leading towards a tragedy. It refers always to a human leader, and one who exercises many different powers or functions, not merely judicial. And many scholars have observed that it is ironic and tragic that the one time the tribes do all act in concert is against one of their own. But according to the Deuteronomistic historian, the institutional structure of a kingdom of God — right, a sort of “theocracy” is how a later Jewish historian would describe this period — a kingdom in which God is the king and the community is led by inspired judges in times of crisis — that structure, that institutional structure failed to establish stability, a stable continuous government. It failed to provide leadership against Israel’s enemies within and without. And then the last half of the book, 16 on to 31, are going to give us the story of Saul and David. It has been noted that after the birth of Samuel, the text conveys a sense of three crises, and I have listed them on the far side of the board over there. But in the meantime, no leader is apparent. And he is also a judge in the sense that he leads Israel to military victory. Samuel is initially opposed to the whole idea. Samuel anoints Saul as king with oil in a kind of a private encounter. He is from the tribe of Benjamin, and he defends them from Ammonite raids. He drove the Philistines from their garrisons, and he was such a popular and natural leader that even Samuel, who at first resented Saul and resented the idea of a king, came to appreciate him and was said to really grieve for him upon his death. He spares his life and otherwise violates the terms of: this notion of total destruction or devotion of booty and enemies to God through total destruction. In several jealous rages Saul attempts to kill David or to have him and his supporters killed. As we are going to see in a minute, David will fare much, much worse in the second installment of his story, and this is the story that takes up the bulk of 2 Samuel. And then in the third account, David is introduced as the 98-pound weakling who takes on the legendary Goliath. We are going to talk next time about the royal ideology that begins to emerge and challenge the older Sinaitic and covenantal ideology."
921,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-14,"The tension between covenant theology, emphasizing the conditional Mosaic convenant from Mt. Sinai, and royal theology emphasizing the unconditional covenant with David in his palace on Mt. Zion, is traced. Following Solomon’s death, the united kingdom separated into a northern and a southern kingdom (named Israel and Judah respectively), the former falling to the Assyrians in 722 and the latter to the Babylonians in 586. Analysis of the Deuteronomistic School’s response to these historical crises and subsequent exile to Babylonia is evidenced through redaction criticism.","We were talking last time about the establishment of the monarchy or kingship in Israel and I want to say a little bit about some of the features of Israelite kingship, and today I’ll be coming back frequently to the Israelite notions of kingship and royal ideology. And that’s what we saw in Nathan’s statement or pronouncement or prophecy to David last time. But first I want to say a little bit more about the characters of David and Solomon before going into the way royal ideology was later developed. He is also credited with great military and tactical skill and confidence. They act out all sorts of scenes of power and lust and courage and struggle. So you do have that kind of whitewashing as part of the historiography of the Book of Chronicles, but it’s lacking here. You have more developed narratives in those sources and these narratives generally feature prophets. And that king seems to enjoy a special covenant with God. There’s a scholar named Jon Levenson, I’ve talked about him before in connection with the covenant at Sinai, but in this wonderful book called   if there’s violation, then God will uproot the Israelites and throw them out of the land — the covenant with David, by contrast, with his dynastic house (and by implication with David’s city and the temple atop Mount Zion), that covenant will be maintained under all conditions. So the royal ideology fostered a belief in some quarters, and we’ll see this in the next few weeks, a belief in the inviolability, the impregnable nature of, David’s house, dynasty, the city itself, the chosen city, the sacred mountain, the temple. We’ll return to this idea in later lectures. We find the Sinai and the Zion traditions in early texts and late texts. The king himself, we will see, is not exempt from the covenant conditions set at Sinai. He would seal these alliances with marriages. Levenson again argues that Zion came eventually to take on the features of the cosmic mountain. The cosmic mountain has these powers or potencies that are universal and infinite and we find it in the religion of Israel as well, specifically in connection with Mount Zion. The temple came to represent an ideal and sacred realm. Now the story of the northern kingdom, Israel, that is presented in Kings, is colored by a Judean perspective, and it is highly negative and highly polemical. This is where we have the covenant renewal ceremony by Joshua, so it’s already a somewhat sacred site. There are linguistic echoes that make it very clear that we are supposed to view this as a sin as great as the sin of Aaron. Despite his best efforts, his kingship is fairly unstable, and in fact in the 200-year history of the kingdom, the northern kingdom of Israel, we will have seven different dynasties occupying the throne. There was great material prosperity in the northern kingdom. Omri bought and fortified Samaria as the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, and archaeology does reveal that this was in fact quite a magnificent city at this time. So there was tremendous rivalry between the Jews of Judah and the Samaritans. Martin Noth was the German scholar who first argued for this, argued that the composition and authorship of Deuteronomy has more in common with what follows in some sense than what precedes it. That means passages that stand back to comment on the text or interpret the text in some way. The historiosophy of the Deuteronomistic school is the response of one segment of the Israelite community, we’ll see another response when we turn to the Prophets, but the basic idea of the Deuteronomistic School is that God’s unconditional and eternal covenants with the patriarchs and with David do not preclude the possibility of punishment or chastisement for sin as specified in the conditional Mosaic covenant."
922,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-15,This lecture concludes the discussion of the Deuteronomistic historian’s efforts to show that idolatry and associated sins lead to God’s wrath and periods of trouble. The remainder of the lecture is an introduction to the phenomenon of Israelite prophecy which included ecstatic prophecy and prophetic guilds. The non-literary prophets of the historical books of the Bible and their various roles (as God’s zealot; as conscience of the king) are examined.,"So we were talking last time about the Deuteronomistic historian and their interpretation of the events that befell Israel, a very special interpretation that would make it possible for Israel to remain intact after the destruction of the state, the temple and the national basis of their society. So for example, Solomon’s misdeeds in allowing the building of altars for the worship of foreign gods to please his many wives, his foreign wives, is blamed for the division of the kingdoms, but the punishment was deferred until after his death and the time of his sons, and  you have this split between north and south with Jeroboam and Rehoboam reigning, respectively, in the north and south. For some, defeat did not lead to despair or apostasy because it could be explained by the likes of the Deuteronomistic historian or the Deuteronomistic School as fitting into the monotheistic scheme. They consigned their sons and daughters to the fire; they practiced augury and divination, and gave themselves over to what was displeasing to the Lord and vexed him. So the Lord spurned all the offspring of Israel and He afflicted them and delivered them into the hands of plunderers, and finally He cast them out from His presence. The literary prophets: those books are collected together in the section we call the Latter Prophets. They are called by God and charged with a mission. They can even be elected against their will. This is very different from prophets who are consulted by a client and given a fee to divine something. Maybe a vision of some kind or a voice that issues a summons or a calling. And that makes the connection between kingship and prophecy quite strong. Every king had his prophetic thorn in the side. You have other prophets, Elijah, of course, against Ahab, Micaiah against Ahab. So that prophetic opposition to the monarch, to the king, sort of God’s watchdog over the king, is an important theme throughout the stories of the former prophets. And it sets the stage for us to understand the writings of the named prophets that will come later. So on numerous occasions we see these professional prophets, these royal prophets, at odds with figures that the biblical writer will view as true prophets. And he’s warned by the messenger who summons him that he’d better speak a favorable word like all the other prophets. And the king seems to sense this and sense this deception, and he says, “How many times must I adjure you to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?”So Micaiah lets the king have it, and he tells of this vision that he received from God, a vision of Israel scattered among, I’m sorry, of Israel scattered over hills like sheep. The implication being that Israel’s shepherd, who is the king, is going to be killed in battle and, like the sheep spread on the hill, Israel will be scattered. The true prophet stands up against the prophetic guilds, the prophets who are employed by the kings. We have very good evidence that Baal was in fact worshipped in the northern Kingdom right down to the destruction. Now, Elijah is hiding from the king, who’s very angry with him for declaring this drought in the name of God. Elijah sets up 12 stones to represent the 12 tribes; he lays the bull out on the altar. And the people prostrate themselves and declare, “Yahweh alone is God. He feels that he has failed in his fight for God. Come out,” He called, “and stand on the mountain before the Lord.” After the wind — an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake. But whereas the earlier theophonies there at Sinai had involved earthquake and wind and fire, the narrative here seems to be making a point of saying that God is not in the earthquake and the wind and the fire. He’s not a nature god, and he’s known only in silence. A final prophetic role is very well-illustrated by the prophet Nathan. King David’s illicit union with Bathsheba — as you know, she’s the wife of Uriah who is fighting in the king’s army — his illicit union with Bathsheba results in her pregnancy. So in these stories we see the prophets functioning as troublers of Israel — certainly from the royal point of view."
923,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-16,"This lecture introduces the literary prophets of both the northern and southern kingdoms. The prophetic books are anthologies of oracles the sequence of which is often determined by literary rather than chronological considerations. This lecture studies the literary features and major themes of classical Israelite prophecy as evidenced in particular in the book of the eighth-century northern prophet Amos. The prophets denounced moral decay and false piety as directly responsible for the social injustice that outrages God. While the Deuteronomist blames the nation’s misfortunes on acts of idolatry, the prophets stress that the nation will be punished for everyday incidents of immorality. The literary prophets counterbalance their warnings with messages of great hope and consolation.","Let me just briefly recap as we are moving into the literary prophets, or the classical prophets, they are sometimes called. Then the prophets of the Babylonian crisis. And you will notice this when you read their writing. They agree that the defeat and the exile are evidence rather than disproof of God’s universal sovereignty, and they agree that they are God’s just punishment for sin. We know that prophetic oracles were written down and transmitted in other ancient Near Eastern societies. This is one of the things that can make it so hard to read some of the prophetic writings, because the oracles are not necessarily in chronological order. It was believed that the words of the prophets had enduring significance. But he prophesies the fall of Judah, and most people would assume that this is an addition which is made to the Book of Amos after Judah’s fall. It is a vision of a basket of summer fruit. One commonplace form that you will see over and over again in these writings is a form that we call the oracle, an oracle against the nations. And so the suggestion by scholars is that without that prophecy concerning the fall of Judah, which post-dates Amos, you would have a nice complete six plus one pattern. So Amos 4:1-3 — and listen to the dramatic rhetoric that is used: “Hear this word, you cows of Bashan/On the hill of Samaria” — that is the capital of the northern kingdom, Israel:Who defraud the poor,Who rob the needy;Who say to your husbands,“Bring, and let’s carouse!”My Lord God swears by His holiness:Behold, days are coming upon youWhen you will be carried off in baskets,And, to the last one, in fish baskets,And taken out  — Each one through a breach straight ahead — And flung on the refuse heap. So when he refers to the cows of Bashan (he speaks to the women of Samaria as the cows of Bashan) he is flattering them to begin with. Some are going to reject the cult of the entire nation. I loathe” — he is speaking now as God, right? If you offer Me burnt I will not accept them;I will pay no heedTo your gifts of fatlings. This is the kind of apotheosis that you find then in the prophetic writings, not the idea of a transformation into a divine being in life or even after death, but the idea that one strives to be god-like by imitating his moral actions, the idea again of .A third feature of the prophetic writings, this is again underscored by Kaufman, but also many other scholars, and that is the prophets’ view of history, their particular view of history, their interpretation of the catastrophic events of 722 and 586. It is an interpretation that centers on their elevation of morality, because the prophets insisted that morality was a decisive, if not the decisive factor, in the nation’s history. Idolatry was what provoked God to drive the nation into exile. This is something we have already seen in the generation of the flood. It is not an issue that we need to decide. And that is that the prophets coupled their message of tragedy and doom with a message of hope and consolation. One of the things that’s so interesting in the classical prophets is that they give a new content to older Israelite ideas about the end of days, or what we call eschatology. It is going to be a day of doom when God will finally call his own people to account. So again at the heart of this idea that the Day of Yahweh is being transformed into this day of judgment, is the old idea that God is the God of history. This is the idea they seem to be battling. And the prophets are challenging this idea. God is, of course, yes, a God of history, of all history. But his involvement with other nations doesn’t extend merely to their subjugation. It seems that an editor has qualified this last oracle of doom, has desired to qualify this last oracle of doom."
924,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-17,"The lecture focuses on the eighth-century northern prophet Hosea, a linguistically difficult book set against the backdrop of the expansionist Assyrian Empire. Hosea’s marriage symbolizes Israel’s relationship with God and serves to remind Israel of God’s forbearance and Israel’s obligations and pledge to loyalty under the covenant at Sinai. The second half of the lecture shifts to Isaiah and his emphasis on the Davidic Covenant, rather than the Mosaic one, a key distinction between him and Hosea. Themes in Isaiah include the salvation of a remnant, Israel’s election to a mission and an eschatology that centers around a “messiah” (anointed) king of the house of David.","We’re going to move on now to our second literary prophet and this is the prophet Hosea. He seems to hold out no real hope for Israel. And I think the one overarching theme that helps us organize most of the material in the Book of Hosea, and one that shows its deep indebtedness to or interconnectedness with the Book of Deuteronomy, is the theme of covenant, particularly Deuteronomy’s notion of covenant. But he’s now the first to couch his charge in the form of this formal , or lawsuit, in which God is said to bring a charge against Israel for violating the terms of the covenant, for breach of covenant. Marriage can be referred to as a , as a covenant between a husband and wife, and so it’s an appropriate metaphor. There really could be no more stark and shocking denial of the covenant than this. And the three children who were cast off at birth, they will be redeemed and accepted by their father. There she shall respond as in the days of her youth,When she came up from the land of Egypt.(So the period of the Exodus and wandering is romantically imagined as, this time, of a very good and close relationship between God and Israel.)“And in that day you will call me  and no more will you call me .”(This is a pun. So that’s a model that works very well with the prophetic message. They’re giving us that passionate, emotional portrait of God. Sometimes when it’s a time of relative ease or comfort, then the prophet emphasizes the violations of the Sinaitic covenant, the punishment that will inevitably come for these violations, and they’ll downplay God’s eternal commitment to his people. The interpretation of many passages in the book of Isaiah as symbolic references to Jesus make it one of the most quoted books of the Bible by Christians. He was active into about the 690s, somewhere in there. And this action is condemned by the biblical writers. This is a time when we’re caught between these two powers — Egypt and Assyria. We refer to these as Second Isaiah and Third Isaiah. So we’ll consider those on another occasion, in their proper historical context. The book also contains material that is a repetition of material found elsewhere. He joins Amos in the assertion that cultic practice without just behavior is anathema to God. And like Amos and Hosea, Isaiah asserts that morality is a decisive factor in the fate of the nation. Isaiah, who also has children with portentous names (this is a fad I guess among the prophets — his children’s names are: “only a remnant will survive,” and “hasten for spoil, hurry for plunder” which indicates the destruction and exile) — he goes to visit the king. So this woman who has conceived will bear a son and will call him Immanuel. He did in fact manage to keep Judah intact against the Assyrian threat and kept Jerusalem from falling in the siege of 701. He denounces the political advisors who counsel the king to form an alliance with Egypt because they are simply trusting in horses and chariots rather than God. Verses 12 and 13  in chapter 6 answer this question with an idea that we’ve seen a little in Amos and Hosea. This is where the prophets differ from the Deuteronomistic historian. When God comes to Jerusalem to save the remnant of Israel and gather in the dispersed exiles it will be a theophany, a self-revelation of God, of worldwide scope. ”For instruction,  will come forth from Zion,The word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And eventually, we’re going to see the idea that the mission for which Israel was elected was to become a “light unto the nations.” The wolf shall dwell with the lamb,The leopard lie down with the kid;The calf, the beast of prey, and the fatling together,With a little boy to herd them. In all of My sacred mountNothing evil or vile shall be done;For the land shall be filled with devotion to the LordAs water covers the sea."
925,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-18,"Micah, eighth-century southern prophet and contemporary of Isaiah, is discussed. Structurally, the book of Micah alternates three prophecies of doom and destruction and three prophecies of hope and restoration. Micah attacks the doctrine of the inviolability of Zion and employs the literary form of a covenant lawsuit (or riv) in his denunciation of the nation. Several short prophetic books are also discussed: Zephaniah; the Book of Nahum, depicting the downfall of Assyria and distinguished for its vivid poetic style; and the book of Habbakuk, which contains philosophical musings on God’s behavior. The final part of the lecture turns to the lengthy book of Jeremiah. A prophet at the time of the destruction and exile, Jeremiah predicted an end to the exile after 70 years and a new covenant that would be inscribed on the hearts of the nation.","We were talking last time about prophets of the Assyrian crisis. We’ve talked about two of the northern prophets, Amos and Hosea, and we started talking about Isaiah who was a southern prophet, a prophet in Judah; and we’ll be talking now about the second southern prophet of the Assyrian crisis. Now, he’s prophesying in the second part of the eighth century, so 740 to about 700. So he also follows the other prophets, as we’ve seen, in condemning the people for their moral failings. But the greatest contrast between Isaiah and Micah — if you want to differentiate these two southern prophets of the Assyrian crisis in your mind — the greatest contrast lies in his view of the city as inherently corrupt. And Micah says: it’s no guarantee of anything. So I think that a shift in theme alone is not ever a certain basis for assuming interpolation — outright contradiction perhaps — but a shift in theme or tone is never a solid basis for assuming interpolation. Anachronism is a very good guide to interpolation. But he is said to have reversed that and to have adopted Assyrian norms. It’s condemned for apostasy; it’s condemned for decadence, all of the things that flourished under King Manasseh. There will be a universal destruction according to Zephaniah. There will be a humble remnant which will seek refuge in God. It seems to announce the salvation as happening now, as present and so a lot of scholars think that this was Zephaniah’s reaction to Josiah and Josiah’s reform which seemed to him to perhaps be the very salvation for which the nation was longing. They deported populations wholesale; they were guilty of all sorts of atrocities like mutilating their captives; they would butcher women and children — all sorts of horrendous deeds. King Jehoiakim rebels and in response, the Babylonians lay siege to Jerusalem. And now the city is in fact captured, the sanctuary is completely destroyed, and the bulk of the population is exiled and this is what brings to end nearly 400years of an independent Hebrew nation. So much so that once again scholars say it must be an interpolation. But in this third chapter, God is described as a warrior god. But on the other hand, it’s possible that it’s Habakkuk himself and again the book exhibits that same paradoxical tension we’ve seen through so many of the prophetic books. Now, he was a contemporary of King Josiah and so he saw the renaissance that briefly occurred under his guidance: the sweeping reform, the eradication of Assyrian influences that had been welcomed by King Manasseh, the renewal of the covenant, all of these activities that are so highly favored by the biblical writer. And when Josiah died, Jeremiah also lamented his passing, along with the rest of the nation. Now, Jeremiah preached the inevitable doom and destruction of the nation because of its violation of the covenant, which was the very charter for her existence, and his descriptions were quite vivid and quite terrifying. Some people question their authenticity, but in any event they paint a very fascinating portrait of the prophet. And he lived his final years out in Egypt. You have the king killed, his son and many people taken into exile in Babylon. Now in his oracle of consolation Jeremiah says,Again there shall be heard in this place… in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man, without inhabitants, without beast — the sound of mirth and gladness, the voice of bridegroom and bride, the voice of those who cry, “Give thanks to the Lord of Hosts, for the Lord is good, for His kindness is everlasting!” It was the end of the temple, the end of the priesthood, the end of Israel as a nation, as an autonomous nation, and so the Israelites were confronted with a great test."
926,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-19,"The destruction of Jerusalem challenged the faith of the nation. What was the meaning of this event and how could such tremendous evil and suffering be reconciled with the nature of God himself? Professor Hayes shows how Israel’s prophets attempted to answer this question, turning the nation’s defeat and despair into an occasion for renewing faith in Israel’s God. The lecture continues with an in-depth study of the book of Ezekiel. Ezekiel’s denunciations of Jerusalem are among the most lurid and violent in the Bible and he concludes that destruction is the only possible remedy. Ezekiel’s visions include God’s withdrawal from Jerusalem to be with his people in exile, and his ultimate return. Ezekiel’s use of dramatic prophetic signs, his rejection of collective divine punishment and assertion of individual responsibility are discussed. The last part of the lecture turns to Second Isaiah and the famous “servant songs” that find a universal significance in Israel’s suffering.","I’m going to go ahead now and get started with some sixth-century material which — prophetic literature — which confronts the issues that were raised by the final destruction of Jerusalem. We also have, in chapter 18, a very interesting emphasis on individual responsibility for sin. Throughout, Ezekiel refers to these nations as the uncircumcised. The tone here is vengeful and very gloating, and these oracles have exerted a very strong influence on the New Testament, particularly the Book of Revelation. So this , this cloud that contains or hides the fire that is Yahweh’s presence — That is also the term that’s used in the Torah,  in Exodus and the priestly sources to describe the presence of God among His people, this fire that’s encased in a cloud, the .In Exodus 24 we read that this  had settled on Mount Sinai representing God’s presence. Now, the call of Ezekiel is reminiscent of the call of Jeremiah and Isaiah. So he swallows this scroll and all of its dreadful contents. There are metaphors of sexual promiscuity throughout the book. Ezekiel makes it clear that those who ignore the warnings are doomed. It is rather that he shall turn back from his ways and live. Repent, therefore, and live!”It’s an important Torah idea that Ezekiel is rejecting or contradicting here. I asked you to remember that the Bible isn’t a book; it’s a library. These are different ideas coming out at different times and receiving emphasis at different times. God is going to initiate a new beginning. Israel will be cleansed from the impurities of the past. One in which the problems that are associated with the exercise of free will may be obviated. And it is described in great detail in the last nine chapters of the book. We’ll be able to look now at what’s been called Second Isaiah. Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,And declare to herThat her term of service is over,That iniquity is expiated;For she has received at the hand of the LORDDouble for all her sins. Because the word of the Lord is always fulfilled. Second Isaiah is also quite well known for the Servant Songs that it contains, the famous servant songs. The identity of this servant — I’ll read some of these passages in a minute, but it refers to this servant, God’s servant, and the identity of the servant has been a puzzle to biblical interpreters for centuries. For He has said:“It is too little that you should be My servantIn that I raise up the tribes of JacobAnd restore the survivors of Israel:I will also make you a light of nations,That My salvation may reach the ends of the earth. We all went astray like sheep,Each going his own way;And the LORD visited upon himThe guilt of all of us. It seems a little odd to say that Israel bears a mission to Israel. But this problem can be solved, if we remember that Israel was often divided in prophetic rhetoric. Leaving aside this difficulty, the more prominent motif in the servant song of Isaiah is that the servant has a mission to the world. The same holds true of Israel in general, by the way, throughout much of the literature."
927,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-1,"This lecture provides an introduction to the literature of the Hebrew Bible and its structure and contents. Common misconceptions about the Bible are dispelled: the Bible is a library of books from diverse times and places rather than a single, unified book; biblical narratives contain complex themes and realistic characters and are not “pious parables” about saintly persons; the Bible is a literarily sophisticated narrative not for children; the Bible is an account of the odyssey of a people rather than a book of theology; and finally, the Bible was written by many human contributors with diverse perspectives and viewpoints.","You don’t need me to tell you that human civilization is very, very old. So: the great civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia and the area we refer to as the Fertile Crescent, of which a little part here about the size of Rhode Island is Canaan. It can be argued that the Ancient Near Eastern people with the most lasting legacy is a people that had an idea. And they carried with them the idea and the traditions that laid the foundation for the major religions of the western world: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. He was known through history, events and a particular relationship with humankind. It’s just wonderful when you read them side by side. So when we compare the Bible with the literature of the Ancient Near East, we’ll see not only the incredible cultural and literary heritage that was obviously common to them, but we’ll see the ideological gulf that separated them and we’ll see how biblical writers so beautifully and cleverly manipulated and used these stories, as I said, as a vehicle for the expression of a radically new idea. In many respects, the Bible represents or expresses a basic discontent with the larger cultural milieu in which it was produced, and that’s interesting for us, because a lot of modern people have a tendency to think of the Bible as an emblem of conservatism. We tend to think of this as an old fuddy-duddy document, it’s outdated, has outdated ideas, and I think the challenge of this course is that you read the Bible with fresh eyes so that you can appreciate it for what it was,  in many ways what it continues to be: a revolutionary, cultural critique. Verses are quoted, they’re alluded to, whether to be championed and valorized or whether to be lampooned and pilloried. Most of our cherished presuppositions about the Bible are based on astonishing claims that others have made on behalf of the Bible, claims that the Bible has not made on behalf of itself. There are many types or genres of material in the Bible. They chose to include all of these dissonant voices together. And despite what they would have us believe. There are episodes of treachery and incest and murder and rape. It explores moral issues and situations, puts people in moral issues and situations. It was sort of a process of naturalization, what we think of today as naturalization. But the fact remains that the document is the basis for the religious faith of many millions of people, and some of them are here now. So, the Former Prophets are narrative texts. The final section of the Bible is referred to as in Hebrew, which simply means “Writings,” and that’s probably about 50% of the Hebrew you’re going to get in the whole course, so please don’t be scared. Our primary concern is the Bible of the ancient Israelite and Jewish community — the 24 books grouped in the Torah, Prophets and Writings on that other sheet — which is common to all Bibles. You may certainly use any other term, and you may certainly use the term Old Testament, as long as it’s clear we’re talking about this set of 24 books and not some of the other things that are in the Old Testament that aren’t in the traditional Hebrew Bible. So it’s really a training ground for the final paper, and we have found that people don’t succeed in the course in the final paper without the training they get in section discussion, which is why section participation is worth ten percent of your grade."
928,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-20,"This lecture begins with the Book of Lamentations, a short book of dirges that laments the destruction of Jerusalem and moves on to introduce the third and final section of the Hebrew Bible - the Ketuvim, or “Writings.” This section of the Bible contains three books that exemplify the ancient Near Eastern literary genre of “Wisdom” – Proverbs, Job and Ecclesiastes. Proverbs reinforces the Deuteronomistic idea of divine retributive justice according to which the good prosper and the evil are punished. The conventional assumption of a moral world order is attacked in the Book of Job. The book explores whether people will sustain virtue when suffering and afflicted, and brings charges of negligence and mismanagement against God for failing to punish the wicked and allowing the righteous to suffer.","When Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon burned the temple and destroyed Jerusalem, the initial reaction was one of overwhelming grief and sadness, and that’s represented primarily in the Book of Lamentations. And it’s traditionally attributed to Jeremiah. It may have arisen, however, because of all of the prophets, Jeremiah is the one who reveals the most to us about his personal suffering and grief, and because he was present as an eyewitness at the destruction. This means that each verse, or sometimes a series of verses, begins with a letter of the alphabet in sequence. Their guilt exceeded the iniquity of Sodom in the passage we just read, and this is a strategy that of course justifies God. In chapter 3, the poet switches into the first person so Jerusalem is speaking like one who is pursued and abused, beaten by an angry and violent master. And when I cry and plead,He shuts out my prayer;He has walled in my ways with hewn blocks,He has made my paths a maze. And in another remarkable passage, the poet describes God as refusing to hear the prayers of Israel. There’s nothing particularly Israelite about them. Sometimes there’s an attempt to connect wisdom specifically with belief in Yahweh. It contains some material of great antiquity. Young people should learn to master their impulses. The wise person’s deeds are good and will bring him happiness and success. He shouldn’t reject this reproof, he should welcome it. So there are two main literary components. And as we’re going to see, the name will be appropriate in both senses as the story progresses. It occurs three times but in fact the third time the reply by Zophar is omitted and that deviation ensures that Job has the first and the last word. He gives four speeches from chapters32 to 37. Job’s children are killed, his cattle are destroyed, his property is destroyed, but Job’s response in chapter 1:21 is, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb and naked I shall return; God gives and God takes away, may the name of the Lord be blessed .The narrator then adds in verse 22, “In all this — ,” and if you flip over I’ve got some of these key verses on the back of your handout to help you keep track, “In all this Job did not sin or impute anything unsavory to God.” That’s a non-negotiable narrative fact and because of the fact of Job’s righteousness, we know Job’s friends are lying when they say Job must be suffering for some hidden sin. As I have seen, those who plow evil / And sow mischief reap them,” chapter 4:7-8.So Eliphaz is handing Job the standard line of biblical Wisdom literature as exemplified by something like the book of Proverbs, belief in a system of divine retributive justice — that retribution is just. When Job complains, “He wounds me much for nothing,” chapter 9:17, he’s echoing God’s own words to the  in the prologue. God’s controlling power is arbitrary and unprincipled. He interferes with the natural order, he interferes with the human order, and this is itself a subversion of the Genesis portrait of creation as a process whose goal and crown is humankind. They both lie in the dustAnd are covered with worms. He rewards wickedness; he causes wickedness by his absence, his failure to govern properly. We may add he believes God has turned his back on him — yet Job persists in the affirmation of his own worth and the transcendent worth of unrewarded good .So in a way then, for all their differences in style and manner, the patient Job of the legend and the raging Job of the poetic dialogue, are basically the same man. Job has posed some very specific challenges to God. In a nutshell, God refuses to be seen as a moral accountant. And it’s that mistaken idea — the idea that led him to ascribe wickedness to God — that Job now recants. The suffering and injustice that characterize the world have baffled humankind for millennia."
929,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-21,"After a detailed explanation of the requirements for the paper assignment, Professor Hayes turns to the Writings - the third section of the Bible - and considers a recent approach to the study of the Bible, called canonical criticism. The books in this section of the Bible explore various questions associated with suffering and evil. An example is the book of Ecclesiastes which constitutes a second attack on the optimism and piety of conventional religious thinking. The lecture concludes with a discussion of a number of Psalms, their genre, purpose, and language.","Okay, so having studied Job, we’ve seen that the Bible is not a book with a single uniform style and message. We can miss the psychological complexity of the stories. We, as readers, know that they are wrong because of the narrative facts established at the beginning of the story. So be sure to consider  point of view in your interpretation. So emphasis is on the final received form of the text. So whatever the circumstances of their origin and final redaction might have been, many of the books of the , of the Writings, eventually would serve the post-exilic community as a prism through which to view Israel’s history. So the writer has tried everything in his search for something that’s permanent and not evanescent. And I came to the conclusion that that too was futile, because the wise man, just like the fool, is not remembered forever; for, as the succeeding days roll by, both are forgotten. ”Nevertheless, despite all of this despair and cynicism, there is a positive note in Qohelet. A similar exhortation is in Qohelet 5:17, “Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life which God has given him, for this is his lot,” . ”We have to be sure not to delude ourselves. There is no grand plan, there’s no absolute value or meaning to our toil, Qohelet says. But one can still find happiness and love, and with these, one should be content. Striving after anything more is a striving after wind that leaves one frustrated and weary, and bitter. Whatever it is in your power to do, do with all your might because you have only this one brief chance. Qohelet is an unusual, if not subversive book, and its inclusion in the canon was apparently a matter of some controversy. The making of many books is without limit / And much study is a wearying of the flesh. To fear God and obey his commandments because he will reward the good and punish the evil is simply not the message of the Book of Qohelet and it’s very likely (in my view; people will disagree) but it’s very likely that this line comes from a later hand, which was disturbed by the theme of Qohelet’s preaching. You have the ten-year-old Jane — she’s a very honest, but mistreated child, and she’s being interviewed by Brocklehurst, who is this very harsh schoolmaster. If Jane were to look closely she would find plenty of emotion and drama and suffering in the Psalms as well. I commemorate your fame for all generations,so peoples will praise you forever and ever. Number 74 laments the destruction of the temple. So what we have is an anthology, an anthology of religious expressions deriving from many centuries of Israel’s history. O Lord our Lord, how majestic is Your name throughout the earth!It’s a tiny little Psalm, Psalm 117, that’s just two verses long  contains really all of the classic formal elements of a Psalm of praise or thanksgiving. The paradigmatic psalm of trust is contained in the 23rd Psalm. The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want;he makes me lie down in green pastures. It is like men wielding axesagainst a gnarled tree;with hatchet and pikethey hacked away at its carved work."
930,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-22,"This lecture continues the discussion of the psalms, and the genres and forms in which they appear, such as psalms of praise and thanksgiving, divine kingship, lament and petition, blessing and cursing, or wisdom. Another poetic book of the Bible is the Song of Songs, an erotic work the sexually explicit content of which has been piously reinterpreted over the centuries. The second half of the lecture turns to the period of the Restoration when the Judean exiles returned to what was now the province of Yehud under Cyrus, the Persian ruler. The books of 1 and 2 Chronicles refer to some of the events of this time as well as the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Ezra and Nehemiah are said to renew the Mosaic covenant with the Torah at its center, and to institute a number of social and religious reforms (including a universal ban on intermarriage that will ultimately fail) in order to consolidate the struggling community.","Last time we started looking at the psalms and a number of different genres or forms in which the psalms appear. To test God was in their mindwhen they demanded food for themselves. May the Lord thus repay my accusers,all those who speak evil against me. The last category I just want to briefly mention is a category of psalms that have a reflective or meditative tone. These are psalms of wisdom, psalms in praise of instruction or Torah and meditation. The fear (or reverence) of the Lord is pure,abiding forever;the judgments of the Lord are true,righteous altogether,more desirable than gold,than much fine gold;sweeter than honey,than drippings of the comb. Perhaps because so many of them lack historical specificity — some of them are quite historical; some of them in fact recount Israel’s history in order to praise God, but many of them, very, very many of them lack any real historical specificity, and that is probably the reason that the Psalms have become a great source for personal spirituality in Western civilization. So it seems natural to attribute this song to Israel’s most prolific composer of songs and proverbs, according to tradition. They are described in highly erotic passages. Translations of the Song of Songs vary tremendously as you might imagine, so I’m going to read one little section from the translation by someone named Walsh, C.E. Walsh, which I think captures the tremendous eroticism in some of the passages of Song of Songs:I slept, but my heart was awake. The conquest is described as being at the command of Babylon’s god, Marduk, so obviously the Babylonians’ god Marduk wanted “our Cyrus of Persia” to be able to come in and conquer this nation. Now, you remember that Jeremiah prophesied that the Babylonian exile would last 70 years; he wrote a letter, he said settle down, this is going to last a while, plant plants and build homes. So he had prophesied 70 years for an exile. They may in fact have formed part of a larger historical work; Ezra, Nehemiah, 1 and 2 Chronicles. The books of Ezra and Nehemiah, however, contain conflicting information about the return, about the restoration, and as a result our knowledge of the timing of various events is quite poor. I’m not going to claim priority for either of them. Chapter 3 of Ezra describes the sacrifices offered on a rebuilt altar and the beginning of the process of rebuilding the temple, probably around 521 or so:When the builders had laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, priests in their vestments with trumpets, and Levites sons of Asaph with cymbals were stationed to give praise to the Lord, as King David of Israel had ordained. In chapters 4, 5, and 6 these Samaritans in many cases, offer to assist in the project of reconstruction. There are two prophets then, Haggai and Zechariah. Ezra is said to have been distressed when he arrived to discover that many of the returned exiles had married with, we think, non-Israelite women. Israel’s tragic fate is because of her sins, and indeed, she’s been given a mercy and a reprieve. But notice his identification of the sin for which Israel was punished. One is only an Israelite if one has both an Israelite mother and an Israelite father. There’s an extended public reading of the Torah of Moses and that’s followed then by a renewal of the Mosaic Covenant:When the seventh month arrived — the Israelites being  in their towns — the entire people assembled as one man in the square before the Water Gate, and they asked Ezra the scribe to bring the scroll of the Teaching of Moses with which the Lord had charged Israel. The recitation of that history is found in Nehemiah 9, and again as an interpretation of the calamities that Israel had faced; it’s consistent with the earlier prayer of Ezra that I read. Ezra and Nehemiah were zealous in their promotion of the renewed covenant, and in their view, the centerpiece of the covenant was the ban on intermarriage and the observance of the Sabbath. What’s happened before just cannot be allowed to happen again. But this is a family that adopted Jewish identity, became fully assimilated. In the last two lectures we’re going to be focusing a lot on the diversity of approaches to the whole question of Israelite or Jewish identity, and the relationship to the Gentile world."
931,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-23,"The Book of Ruth, in which a foreign woman enters the community of Israel and becomes great-grandmother to none other than King David, expresses a view of gentiles entirely opposed to that of Ezra and Nehemiah. Other prophets of the Restoration period are discussed, including Third Isaiah who also envisions other nations joining Israel in the worship of Yahweh. This period also sees the rise of apocalyptic literature in works like Zechariah, Joel and Daniel. Written during a period of persecution in the 2 c. BCE the book of Daniel contains many features and themes of apocalyptic literature, including an eschatology according to which God dramatically intervenes in human history, destroying the wicked (understood as other nations) and saving the righteous (understood as Israel).","All right, let’s go ahead and get started; there’s a lot to cover. But I want to try to unite a lot of these disparate parts of the Bible, the many small books clustered here at the end that we’ll be considering. And the Moabites were hated for their ill-treatment of the Israelites when they were traveling to the Promised Land. So the Moabites and Ammonites are two foreign groups that are explicitly prohibited from entering the congregation in Deuteronomy 23.The Israelites’ low opinion of the Moabites is also expressed in Genesis in the very degrading story of Moab’s descent from the incestuous relationship between Lot and one of his daughters, after the fall of Sodom. For wherever you go, I will go; wherever you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God. Those obligations — the primary obligations are three: (1)To redeem the person or their property if they’ve been sold to a stranger due to poverty. You should know that biblically, threshing floors tend to be places of revelry at the end of the harvest time and they are often frequented by prostitutes. But Naomi seems to be planning Ruth’s seduction of Boaz. Then she went over stealthily and uncovered his feet and lay down. We’re going to look now briefly at some of the last prophetic books, and these are writings that date to the time of the first generations of returned exiles and on. Earlier prophets received a word or a vision but as we move towards apocalyptic literature and later literature, prophets often receive messages from God through an angel or a messenger. Only then will the glory of Jerusalem and a messianic ruler be restored, and the hope that has to sustain the community through the bleak present is therefore an eschatological hope, a hope that focuses on an ideal account of the end, (eschatology = an account of the end). You remember the Book of Isaiah, which is 66 chapters, we divided into three parts: 1 through 39, which is the historical Isaiah; then we have Second Isaiah; and then ThirdIsaiah, we’re dealing with now — that’s chapters 56 to 66.The anonymous prophetic author of these chapters denounces the failings of the exiles, but does hold out an eschatology; a doctrine of final things that depicts what’s going to happen in the end of days. Now, there’s only one biblical book, which pretty much in its entirety, belongs to the genre of literature known as apocalyptic. That doesn’t mean all eschatological work is apocalyptic. In general, the message is highly symbolic. A sixth feature is that God generally appears in apocalyptic literature as an enthroned king. He will intervene in human history, he’ll set everything right, he’ll interrupt the natural order, he’s going to destroy this broken world as we know it, and he’ll do so in order to rescue the righteous and humiliate the wicked, and if you’ve already died don’t worry there will be a resurrection, it will all be made right. The second part of Joel which begins in verse 28 of chapter 2  is a fully apocalyptic description of the final day of terror. Towards the end, then, of the book we read,Let the nations rouse themselves and march upTo the Valley of Jehosaphat;For there I will sit in judgmentOver all the nations roundabout. Swing the sickle,For the crop is ripe;Come and tread,For the winepress is full,The vats are overflowing!For great is their wickedness.…But the Lord will be a shelter to His people,A refuge to the children of Israel.…And Jerusalem shall be holy;Nevermore shall strangers pass through it. You have a cosmic battle in which Yahweh triumphs over Israel’s enemy. They’re a bit like the book of Esther that we’ll be talking about on Wednesday. Each metal represents a kingdom that ruled the Ancient Near East. But he emerges unharmed, and the result is, again, that the foreign king, in this case Darius now, recognizes the supremacy of Yahweh and orders all in his kingdom to revere the Jewish God. There is, of course, no historical merit to these stories of Babylonian and Persian kings acknowledging or adopting the God of the Jews who lived in exile among them. These stories seem to give voice to the hope or the fantasy that a cruel and impious monarch might be taught humility by Yahweh. Chapter 7 again represents the succession of kingdoms, the Babylonian, the Median, the Persian, the Macedonian Empires, but this time as beasts. Now in Daniel, this phrase, the Son of Man — which generally means mortal as opposed to divine in the Bible, but — in Daniel the phrase seems to refer to a figure that’s in human form, but more than a human. So the Son of Man overwhelms the little horn Antiochus, who is said to be making war on saints (that’s a code for loyal Jews), who is said to have been trying to change their law and abolish their religion — and we know that these were parts of the persecution in 167 to 164 by Antiochus."
932,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-24,"In this lecture, two final books of the Bible are examined and their attitudes towards foreign nations compared. In contrast to Daniel’s reliance on divine intervention to punish the wicked, the book of Esther focuses on human initiative in defeating the enemies of Israel. Finally, the book of Jonah–in which the wicked Assyrians repent and are spared divine punishment–expresses the view that God is compassionate and concerned with all creation. Professor Hayes concludes the course with remarks regarding the dynamic and complex messages presented in the Hebrew Bible.","An interesting counterpoint to the apocalyptic literature and the apocalyptic reliance on God’s cataclysmic consummation of history in order to dole out justice to the righteous and the wicked, is found in the Book of Esther. This is chapter 3:4-6, and “When they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them,” speaking to Mordechai and he won’t listen to them,…they told Haman, in order to see whether Mordechai’s resolve would prevail; for he had explained to them that he was a Jew. This is to be the thirteenth of the month of Adar. And Mordechai responds with this message. Then I shall go to the king, though it is contrary to the law, and if I am to perish, I shall perish!”So Mordechai went about the city and did just as Esther had commanded him. If the book of Esther presents one alternative to the post-exilic eschatologies in which Yahweh’s enemies are afflicted and consumed for their wickedness, then the book of Jonah offers another perspective. And that is a fact that strikes great terror in the heart of the sailors when they hear this, that his God is Yahweh. So Jonah proposes that he be thrown overboard to save the ship. Now, the sailors are said by the narrator to revere God. God calls him again and in contrast to his first response, this time Jonah sets out for Nineveh at once. They shall be covered with sackcloth — man and beast — and shall cry mightily to God. But the stronger problem for Jonah seems to be the lack of punishment for the wicked. The date of the book of Jonah really can’t be ascertained and you will hear arguments in both directions. This is an idea that we’ve already seen in some of the late prophetic writings. But only in Israel does the question of evil touch on the very essence of God and the very foundation of religious faith. But in biblical religion there is no independent evil principal. There’s room for multiple models, multiple images of God and his relationship to Israel. Don’t forget the review session that will be held here with me next week from 10:30-12:30."
933,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-2,"In this lecture, the Hebrew Bible is understood against the background of Ancient Near Eastern culture. Drawing from and critiquing the work of Yehezkel Kaufmann, the lecture compares the religion of the Hebrew Bible with the cultures of the Ancient Near East. Two models of development are discussed: an evolutionary model of development in which the Hebrew Bible is continuous with Ancient Near Eastern culture and a revolutionary model of development in which the Israelite religion is radically discontinuous with Ancient Near Eastern culture. At stake in this debate is whether the religion of the Hebrew Bible is really the religion of ancient Israel.","I mentioned in the opening lecture that this course is going to examine the biblical corpus from a variety of different viewpoints and take a variety of approaches, historical, literary, religious, cultural. The fundamental idea of pagan religion, he says, and I quote, is “the idea that there exists a realm of being prior to the gods and above them, upon which they  — the metadivine realm. This is the realm of supreme and ultimate power and it transcends the deities. There can therefore, be no notion of a supreme divine will, an absolute or sovereign divine will. So if it’s blood, then blood that courses through the veins of living creatures is seen to have some deep and powerful connection with the metadivine realm and that is where power resides. If it is water, then water will be viewed as particularly materially powerful in that particular system. It’s not directed at the gods, unless you’re hoping to use them as a medium through which to get access to the metadivine realm, but ultimately most divination is aimed at tapping the secrets of the metadivine realm and not the gods. One final and very important point, and we’re going to wrestle with this quite a bit during the year: Kaufman claims, again, in the polytheistic worldview, the primordial realm contains the seeds of all being: everything is generated from that realm, good and bad. And it’s that picture of the universe, Kaufman wants to argue, that is challenged by the monotheistic revolution. Again he sees this as a revolution of ancient Israel. That means that this God transcends nature. So there is no blurring, no soft boundary between humans and the divine, according to Kaufman, in the Bible. God can’t be manipulated or coerced by charms or words or rituals. They have no power and cannot be used in that way, and so magic is sin. These are things that are very common in polytheistic and pagan practices. Kaufman is claiming therefore that in Israel evil is transferred from the metaphysical realm (built into the physical structure of the universe) to the moral realm. Evil is a moral and not a metaphysical reality. What about the serpent in the Garden of Eden? But the interaction between God and humans, he says, happens not through nature but through history. We do find evidence in the Bible as well as in the archaeological record, of popular practices that are not strictly monotheistic. He doesn’t emerge from a preexisting realm. Let the text be contradictory and inconsistent and difficult. So the differences between the god of the monotheizing sources of the Bible and the gods of surrounding Mesopotamian literature and older Israelite ideas, perhaps, they’re apparent from the very first chapters of Genesis. But Genesis 1 is a very strongly monotheistic opening to the primeval myths that are then contained in the next ten chapters of Genesis. Put your name on an index card so we know you’re interested in taking the course and we know how many bodies we have. Let people know where you are.—ReferencesGeller, Stephen A. 2004. “"
934,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-3,"In the first of a series of lectures on the book of Genesis, the basic elements of biblical monotheism are compared with Ancient Near Eastern texts to show a non-mythological, non-theogonic conception of the deity, a new conception of the purpose and meaning of human life, nature, magic and myth, sin and evil, ethics (including the universal moral law) and history. The two creation stories are explored and the work of Nahum Sarna is introduced.","Today what I’d like to do is begin our survey of Genesis 1 through 11, in order to illustrate the way that biblical writers — and precisely who we think they were and when they lived is something we’ll talk about later — but the way biblical writers drew upon the cultural and religious legacy of the Ancient Near East that we’ve been talking about, its stories and its imagery, even as they transformed it in order to conform to a new vision of a non-mythological god. ”When Apsu heard this, his face grew radiantBecause of the evil he planned against the gods, his sons. Well, what do you do with the carcass of a ferocious monster? And the bottom part is the land, which is pressing down waters below. The moon god has to come up at night and hang around for a while and go back down. According to Sarna and some other scholars, the conflict, that battle scene between Tiamat and Marduk which is described at some length, symbolizes the conflict or the battle between the forces of chaos and the forces of cosmos or cosmic order. The portrait of humans that emerges is that humans are unimportant menials. To some degree, they look upon them as slaves or pawns. The picture of the world that would seem to emerge from this story is that it is a morally neutral place. There’s no story by means of which he emerges from some other realm. And this is also a good time for us to draw a distinction between mythology and myth. Kaufman and others have claimed that mythology is not in, certainly, this biblical story or if it’s not there it’s at least suppressed. When God began to create heaven and earth,” and there’s a parenthetical clause: “God said, ‘Let there be light’ and there was light.” In the first account in Genesis 1, the creation of the human is clearly the climactic divine act: after this God can rest. And a sign of the humans’ importance is the fact that humans are said to be created in the image of God, and this occurs in Genesis 1:26, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” And it seems, therefore, that the idea of being created in the image of God is connected with those special rights and duties. So, if those are the distinctive characteristics that earn the human being certain rights over creation but also give them duties towards creation, and the human is distinct from animals in being created in the image of God, there’s perhaps a connection: to be godlike is to perhaps possess some of these characteristics. So, humans in Genesis are not presented as the helpless victims of blind forces of nature. And that translation suggests that the story isn’t concerned to depict the ultimate origins of the universe. Isaiah 51:9-10: “It was you that hacked Rahab” — this is another name of a primeval water monster — “in pieces,/ That pierced the Dragon./It was you that dried up the Sea,/The waters of the great deep.” And that’s what the firmament  this by the way is the portrait of the world; it looks a lot like my map of the Ancient Near East, but it’s not. That’s the image in  and it’s the image of Genesis 1. So, the firmament is sort of like an inverted bowl, a beaten-out sheet of metal that’s an inverted bowl, and again as I said: echoes of , where you have Marduk dividing the carcass of Tiamat, like a shellfish. They reject certain elements but they almost reject them by incorporating them. So, one of the things I’ve tried to claim in describing Genesis 1 is that in this story evil is represented not as a physical reality. And the drama of human life should revolve not around the search for eternal life but around the moral conflict and tension between a good god’s design for creation and the free will of human beings that can corrupt that good design. That’s one line of interpretation that’s gone through many theological systems for hundreds of years."
935,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-4,"This lecture continues the discussion on Genesis, including the familiar accounts of Cain and Abel, the Flood and Noahide covenant. The story of Cain and Abel expresses the notion of the God-endowed sanctity of human life and a “universal moral law” governing the world. Examination of the contradictions and doublets in the flood story leads to a discussion of the complex composition and authorship of the Pentateuch. These features as well as anachronisms challenge traditional religious convictions of Moses as the author of the first five books of the Bible.","So, last time I gave a reading of the creation accounts that are in Genesis 1 to 3. But before he can enter the city and meet Gilgamesh he has to be tamed. ”So that’s tablet I from .So through this sexual experience Enkidu has become wise, growing in mental and spiritual stature, and he is said to have become like a god. He’s unaware of — he’s unattracted by — the benefits of civilization: clothing, cities and all their labor. You will certainly hear it argued, but it seems unlikely in my view. Now admittedly that comes from the first creation story in Genesis 1; nevertheless in the second creation story when the writer is recounting the creation of woman, the writer refers to the fact that man and woman will become one flesh. God vents his fury on all three, and he does so in ascending order: first the snake for his trickery and then the woman, and finally the man. But now that means there is a serious danger here, and in Genesis 3:22, God says, “Now that man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil , what if he should stretch out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever?” And we could perhaps draw two conclusions from this. Once they discovered their moral freedom, once they discovered that they could thwart God and work evil in the world, and abuse and corrupt all that God had created, then God could not afford to allow them access to the tree of life. The story is explaining how these odd conditions of life came to be as they are, which is not to say that it’s the ideal situation, or even that it’s God’s will for humankind; these are etiological fables, and they’re best read as such. Second of all in this story we see something that we’ll see repeatedly in the Pentateuch, and that is that God has to punt a bit. Finally I’ll just draw your attention to some interesting details that you can think about and maybe talk about in section. Nahum Sarna and others have noted that the word “brother” occurs throughout this story repeatedly, and it climaxes in God’s question, “Where is your , Abel?” God prefers the offering of Abel, and as a result Cain is distressed and jealous to the point of murder. The Sumerian story of Ziusudra is very similar to the Genesis account. When the hero emerges he builds an altar. He offers sacrifice to the deity and receives a blessing. In  we have no motive given for the divine destruction whatsoever. Noah is saved specifically for his righteousness, he was righteous in his generation. He was chosen therefore for moral reasons. But the view eventually will be that only Israel is obligated to the God of Israel, other nations aren’t held accountable for their idolatry in the books of the Torah. They apply to all humanity not just Israel. When we read the flood story in Genesis 6 through 9, we’re often struck by the very odd literary style. Those are actually different Hebrew words underneath there, okay? There are also differences in terminology between the two stories. So the terms for gender are different in the two stories. He forms the human like a potter working with clay. Similarly there are some anachronisms that they had to explain."
936,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-5,"This lecture introduces the modern critical study of the Bible, including source theories and Wellhausen’s Documentary Hypothesis, as well as form criticism and tradition criticism. The main characteristics of each biblical source (J, E, P, and D) according to classic source theory are explained. This lecture also raises the question of the historical accuracy of the Bible and the relation of archaeology to the biblical record.","We were talking last time about evidence of the use of different sources in the biblical text, and I mentioned Richard Simon, who was the first to argue that perhaps Moses wasn’t the author of the entire Torah. So although the sources claim to talk about events from creation, actually, forward, Wellhausen says, no, they really can only be used to tell us about the beliefs and religion of Israel from the tenth century, which is when he thinks the oldest was written, and forward. It was argued by some that those were basically the borders of the Kingdom of Israel under David and Solomon. A book is found that says one central sanctuary. And this of course is a very, very different portrait from traditional claims about the authorship of the Pentateuch by one man, Moses, in approximately the fourteenth century BCE.There are different terms that we use to describe the modern, critical study of the Bible in the late nineteenth century as I’ve just described it. And these sorts of biases are very apparent in his work, and very apparent in his dating of the sources, and in his description of the evolutionary stages of Israel’s religion. So for example, source critics before Wellhausen all thought that P, the priestly material, was some of the oldest material in the Bible, that it was an early source. The documentary hypothesis works fairly well when you have parallel accounts. Some of them are excellent, excellent guesses, very well supported by evidence, but some of them are not. So the Bible can be read both analytically and synthetically. And I put those in subversively for you to have a look at in your own time. They’re brilliantly written and they give you insight into the various ways in which we can read the text .But many of the alternative methodologies for studying the text do assume sources, in some broad sense even if not all the details of Wellhausen’s theory, so it’s clear that a great deal of biblical scholarship owes its accomplishments and its theories to the work that was done by the source critics of the nineteenth century. So this mighty tower that was obviously the pride of Babylon in the ancient world is represented by the biblical storywriter as the occasion for the confusion of human language. They are indicative of an arrogant sort of self-reliance — that the prophets will certainly rail against — and in some sense a forgetting of God. Although God created the earth as an intrinsically good paradise, he created humans in his image, he provided for them, humans to this point have put their moral freedom pretty much to poor use. So these myths are telling also of a struggle, but it’s on a different plane. I’m going to ask you to think like historians — whatever that might mean — now and as we move into next week and look at Genesis 12 through 50.The source critical method that we talked about today focuses on the hypothetical period of the compilation of the text, the compilation of the four sources into the Torah. Remember that the source critics claimed and concluded that J, E, P and D were written from the tenth to the sixth centuries, and the implication, well actually not just the implication, the strong assertion of many of them was that despite the fact that they purport to tell of events prior to 1000, in fact they’re just not at all reliable for those periods. That helps us learn something about ancient Israelite society or culture way before the tenth century. What does this tell us about society and what people were doing?Growing out of form criticism is tradition criticism. People don’t sit down and invent things out of whole cloth, particularly material of this type. It clearly has a history, they’re clearly drawing on sources and maybe we can use analytical tools to figure out something about the period that you might think would be lost to history. You have ten generations from Adam to Noah. And they cited a number of considerations. By what criteria do I judge historical writing? In general the terms exilic and post-exilic are not used with great precision in these lectures."
937,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-6,"This lecture continues with a review of scholarly views on the historical accuracy of the Bible. The narratives of the patriarchs and matriarchs are introduced and the covenant between Abraham and God–which ultimately leads to the formation of a nation–is explained. Central themes of the patriarchal stories include: God’s call to Abraham, God’s promise of a blessed and fruitful nation, threats to this promise (including the story of the binding of Isaac for sacrifice). Finally, after a significant character transformation, the third patriarch Jacob becomes Yisrael (“he who struggles with God”).","So last time we started discussing the historical merits of the biblical stories of the patriarchs and the matriarchs. So for example, Nahum Sarna argues that representing Abraham and Isaac and Jacob as foreigners and strangers in Canaan is hardly a convenient tradition for a people who are seeking to establish their claim to its homeland. He also notes that some of the material in the patriarchal stories would be offensive to later religious sensibilities. Jacob is married to two sisters simultaneously. So that’s on the one hand: scholars who see these stories as reflecting historical memories and having a certain authenticity to them. But you also have the same two extreme positions reflected in the discipline of archaeology. We’re doing biblical archaeology; archeology in support of the biblical text. They could derive from anywhere in the second or first millennium. In fact, this reconstruction often does contradict biblical claims. And that’s something they don’t want to give up. But then all ancient historical narrative is written that way, and one could argue all contemporary historical narrative is written that way. But we’ll begin by identifying some, by no means all, of the major themes of Genesis 12 through 50. But they represent this emigration as divinely commanded. Haran died in the lifetime of his father Terah, in his native land, Ur of the Chaldeans. How clever of the narrator to plant the information we need to realize that Abram has to take God’s word on faith, and how perfectly the narrator sets up the dramatic tension and the great confusion that is going to run through the next several chapters, because Abram doesn’t seem to understand that the progeny will come from Sarai. So Abram may be forgiven for thinking that perhaps some other mate awaits him. We’ve already seen one, the Noahide covenant; and the Abrahamic covenant, which we’re looking at now. So here, and in other places in the Bible, it’s clear that God’s covenant with Israel is not due to any special merit of the Israelites or favoritism: this is actually said explicitly in Deuteronomy. But despite them, the patriarchal episodes or stories are peppered with episodes in which the realization of the promise and the blessing is threatened. In chapter 12, Abram surrenders his wife Sarai to Pharaoh in order to advance his position among the Egyptians, plausibly not knowing that it is Sarai who is supposed to bear the child of God’s promise. Hagar and her child Ishmael cry out to God in the wilderness and God assures Hagar that Ishmael, who’s regarded by Muslims as the ancestor of the Arabs and the inheritor of the blessing and the promise, that Ishmael shall become a great nation too . But really the greatest threat to the promise comes from God himself, and that is in Genesis 22 when God tests Abraham with the most horrible of demands. Auerbach contrasts the literary style of Homer with the biblical writer’s style specifically in connection with the story of Genesis 22.The ambiguities and the indeterminacy of this story make it one of the most interpreted texts of all time. He sees the wood and the firestone in his father’s hand. And the Lord answered, “If I find within the city of Sodom fifty innocent ones, I will forgive the whole place for their sake.” This is merely one instance of a pattern of violent brutality. She seems to run everywhere, and she does all this not knowing that the man she greets is the servant of Abraham who has come to seek a wife for his master’s son, Isaac. But he is willing to give seven years more service for Rachel. The sun rose upon him as he passed Peniel, limping on his hip. In its Israelite version, however, this story is historicized."
938,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-7,"The book of Genesis concludes with the story of Joseph and the descent of the 12 tribes into Egypt, setting the stage for the Exodus in which God is seen as redeemer and liberator. Moses is the first in a line of apostolic (messenger) prophets and Yahwism is initiated. Mark Smith’s thesis describing the emergence of Israelite religion through a process of convergence and divergence is presented as an alternative to the evolutionary-revolutionary dichotomy presented in Lecture 2.","We were talking last time about the mysterious episode by the Yabbok River, when Jacob undergoes a change in name, and I mentioned the fact that in the biblical view, the name of something somehow encapsulates its very essence. He greets his former rival and enemy with these words — this is in Genesis 33:10-11: “ ‘If you would do me this favor, accept for me this gift, for to see your face is like seeing the face of God, and you have received me favorably. So he casts the humans out of the Garden, blocks access to the tree of life. The art of dream interpretation places a very important role in this story, and dream interpretation was a developed science, particularly in Egypt, and the other parts of Mesopotamia, but the Egyptians were known in the ancient world as dream interpreters. So Joseph is sold  ultimately ends up in the household of Pharaoh in Egypt, and his adventures there prove his meritorious character. The land never belongs to the patriarchs to whom it was promised. It was erected by a pharaoh, Pharaoh Merneptah. It’s the kind of number that crops up a lot in biblical chronologies, which makes it suspect for other sorts of reasons, as well. Why would you invent a myth of origins in which your ancestors are slaves? A lot of scholars have noted that this story is full of irony. Moreover, the basket is placed among the reeds — the Hebrew word for reeds is  — and that’s a hint or an allusion to the fact that Moses will lead the Israelites through the “Reed Sea,” the Yam Suph. This legendary birth story has important parallels in Ancient Near Eastern and other literature. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his kinsmen. There at the well, again he acts to defend the defenseless. So again, this is a key to Moses’ character, aiding the defenseless. To understand that new beginning, we need to look at the differences between patriarchal religion, and the new Yahwism. Look first at the sheet that gives you the titles of God, and you’ll see that in the patriarchal traditions — so we’re talking about Genesis primarily; I’ve thrown in some other texts also, but focusing for a moment on the patriarchal traditions of Genesis — God is six times called El Shaddai. He makes promises of progeny to Abraham and his heirs. God is depicted as a warrior, who leads his host , the Lord of hosts in battle. Well, so far we’ve had two models that have been thrown out to you: the kind of classic evolutionary model. The evolutionary model is, I think, responding to, and picking up on, the fact that in many respects, Yahweh resembles the gods of Israel’s neighbors. It explains the deep similarity of Israel’s deity and the deities of her neighbors, but it also explains the vehement biblical polemic against Canaanite religion, and Baal worship in particular, which we will come to see. The P and the E sources preserve this insight; and they preserve it in their insistence that the Patriarchs worshiped God as El, but at the time of the Exodus, God revealed himself as Yahweh. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company."
939,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-8,"This lecture traces the account of the Exodus (and the origin of the Passover festival as a historicization of older nature festivals) and Israel’s liberation from bondage under Pharaoh. The story reaches its climax with the covenant concluded between God and Israel through Moses at Sinai. Drawing heavily on the work of Jon Levenson, the lecture examines Ancient Near Eastern parallels to the Sinaitic covenant and describes the divine-human relationship (an intersection of law and love) that the covenant seeks to express.","So following the theophany at the burning bush, Moses returns to Egypt, and he initiates what will become ultimately a battle of wills between Pharaoh and God. J has eight and E has three, and P has five, and some of them are the same as one another, and some of them are different, and so on. In other words, what we probably have here are two older, separate, springtime rituals. So they’re swamped by these roiling waters. But a few verses later it’s clear that the poet isn’t really drowning: this is a metaphor for his difficult situation. “ The voice of the Lord is over the waters. Now, Michael Coogan, who’s a very important biblical scholar and an expert in the Canaanite texts, the Ugaritic materials, has made some intriguing observations in connection with the biblical representation of Yahweh in terms that are so reminiscent of the storm god, Baal . The most important is that Yahweh’s battle is a historic battle, rather than a mythic battle. It’s a weapon in the divine arsenal, and it’s deployed on behalf of Israel, but, again, Yahweh is depicted by the biblical writer as transcending nature, using forces of nature for a historical purpose, acting in history to deliver his people, and create a new nation, Israel. So Levenson, in his book, tries to correct this prejudicial treatment. Remember we talked about two types of treaties: suzerainty treaties and parity treaties. The curses are particularly emphasized in the Assyrian treaties. In verse 8, the people solemnly undertake to fulfill the terms of the covenant, so we have at least three of the steps that we find in the Hittite treaties, as well. In Deuteronomy we read that it will be deposited for safekeeping in a special ark. Israel can rely on God, just as a vassal can rely on his suzerain. Levenson and other scholars, point many of these out. The assertion is not that there is no other god, but that Israel will have no other god before Yahweh. If Israel serves a divine king, she can’t, for example, serve a human king, and that’s an idea that will express itself in biblical texts, as we’ll see, that are clearly opposed to the creation of a monarchy in Israel. Vassal so-and-so will love the Assyrian lord so-and-so, and that’s an element that is not absent at all in the biblical texts that deal with the covenant bond. The long section where we have the receipt of the instructions for the building of the temple, and then we have an actual account of those instructions being fulfilled, not the temple, tabernacle, excuse me: it’s just a tent structure at this stage — so receiving the instructions and then the actual construction of the tabernacle, that extends from Exodus 25 to the end of the book, Exodus 40; but it’s interrupted in Exodus 32 by the account of the Israelites’ apostasy with the golden calf, which is a great and very ambiguous story. As Moses receives God’s covenant on Mount Sinai — he’s there at the top of Sinai communing with God — the Israelites who are encamped at the foot of the mountain grow restless, and rebellious, and they demand of Aaron a god, because they don’t know what’s become of “this fellow Moses.” But each time the one convinces the other to be forbearing. I’m going to just give you two examples of the way Moses and God act as a check upon each other. Our wives and children will be carried off! Moses heard the people weeping, every clan apart, each person at the entrance of his tent. But at the same time, he consoles the people when they fear they’ve driven God away irreparably, and when he turns to face God, he defends the people before God."
940,religious-studies,rlst-145,lecture-9,"In this lecture, the Priestly source (P) found primarily in Leviticus and Numbers is introduced. The symbolism of the sacrificial cult and purity system, the differences between moral and ritual impurity, as well as holiness and purity are explained within the Priestly context. The concept of holiness and , or human imitation of God, is explained.","Today we’re going to be turning to Leviticus. Chapters 17 through 26 then are a block of material that’s referred to as the “Holiness code” because of its special emphasis on holiness. The main sacrificial altar with a large ramp stood in that courtyard as well as a basin that was there for ablutions. And we have in Ancient Near Eastern iconography thrones of this type. That has a negative connotation in English, but in fact it really doesn’t bear that negative connotation. It’s not separated or marked off for special kind of treatment because it’s holy. So separation from that which threatens its sanctity. The principle is graphically demonstrated in spatial terms. There are ordinary, common, profane days, work days. The purity required of the high priest is even greater. Sexual contact makes one ritually impure, and yet God commands humans to be fruitful and multiply. So Klawans points out, as you know, that there are three main sources of impurity in P. First of all, corpses and certain carcasses are a source of ritual impurity, which is this — we translate it “scale disease,” it’s been called leprosy. People who know such things have read the details in the biblical texts and it’s not what is truly known as leprosy. He commands proper care of the dead, and he also does that in the P-source. So according to Klawans, ritual purification involved separation from those aspects of humanity, death and sex, that are least God-like. So the process of sacrifice, I won’t go into his argument here, but Klawans develops a strong argument that the process of sacrifice can be understood itself as an act of , because sacrifice involves a variety of behaviors in the biblical text that are analogous to behaviors attributed elsewhere in the biblical texts to God: the care and feeding and raising of domestic animals, the selection of one that is deemed perfect, control over its life and death and so on. These are sacrifices that are offered as gifts or in times of celebration. This is when an animal is entirely burned to create, as the text says, a pleasant smelling odor or pleasant smelling smoke that ascends to God. Well-being offerings are of three main types. And in important ways, the Israelite cult is strikingly similar, particularly in the sacrifices I’ve just described. So this is the second overriding concern or organizing principle of the sacrifice: not simply that there should be  within God’s realm, but also that the activities there should attract and maintain the presence of the deity for the well-being of the community. The three that I’ve listed here are the biggies: idolatry, homicide and sexual transgressions. Moral purity of persons can be achieved only by punishment for heinous sins: for example, the punishment of , or cutting off, is a divine punishment of being extirpated from the House of Israel; death, alright, that’s one way to be rid of moral impurity. Very severe moral impurity defiles the innermost areas of the sanctuary as well as the land. In cases of accidental homicide, the perpetrator can take refuge in one of five cities that are designated for this purpose: the five cities of refuge. So the life force is holy and the life force is in the blood. It symbolizes the victory of the forces of life, oath and holiness over death and impurity. So the goal or the objective of the Priestly construction or representation of Israel’s impurity laws was, in Milgrom’s view, to sever impurity from the demonic and to reinterpret it as a symbolic system reminding Israel of the divine imperative to reject sin, to behave in ways that attract the presence of God and do not repel him."
941,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-10,"The speech that Stephen gives before his accusers in Acts shows how the author of Luke-Acts used and edited his sources. So, also, does the description of the destruction of Jerusalem in Luke, as compared to that in Mark. The major themes of Luke-Acts are 1) the Gospel going first to the Jews and then to gentiles and 2) that of the prophet-martyr, with Jesus as the prophet-martyr par excellence.","The chronological and geographical structure of Luke-Acts is thematic and theological, not historical. How you can actually see the author of Luke-Acts taking sources that he took before him, perhaps some oral sources, I’ve argued that some of these were even written sources, because it seems like you can actually see where he takes something that was in a written account of the spread of Christianity, slices it at one place, separates that, and puts several chapters in Acts between them. I don’t think that’s actually correct for the historical Jesus as we’ll talk about when we get to the historical Jesus. Notice then we get to–these are the accusations about Stephen, but then in chapter 7 we get Stephen’s own speech. It sounds like Moses is predicting Joshua’s being raised up after he dies, but that’s not what Stephen thinks. “ ”David was the first one who raised the idea of having a temple to God, not just a tabernacle but a temple, that’s where we’re going in the history here. “But it was Solomon who built the house for him. The author of Acts is not himself anti-temple. He believes that the Jerusalem temple is just fine for Jews. Some of you, if you don’t have Throckmorton’s Gospel parallels, or some other Gospel parallels, this is why these are very useful, because I’m going to use this that way I have Mark right here and Luke right here for the same passage and I can compare them very, very directly, see exactly what words they have different. Look at the Mark passage first, 3:14:“But when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be (let the reader understand) …”And then he says, get out of town, get out of Judea. So Luke’s using that false prophet material but not in this context. Now let’s look at how some of these things play out. There is no Holy One like the Lord, no one beside you; there is no rock like our God. Over and over again, see Paul goes to a town, he goes first to the synagogue, he preaches in the synagogue, the Jews reject him, he kind of shakes the dust off his feet, you Jews rejected the Gospel therefore we’re going to the Gentiles. This idea that the message must be preached first to the Jews and only then to the Gentiles, is a point that Acts makes over, and over, and over again. He lived there two whole years at his own expense. In other words, the very end of the two-volume work ends with this message that the message was preached to the Jews, they rejected it, so Paul and the others went to the Gentiles. Luke tells us,  31:They appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure which was about to be accomplished at Jerusalem. Now the Greek word there for departure is . He needs some advice on how to do an exodus, and the exodus doesn’t refer to just his leaving the country, it refers to his martyrdom. You’re innocent as far as we’re concerned. What does Luke believe about the Jewish law? These are diversities of Christianity we see. In fact, they would say, what does it mean to have a Messiah at all? Here’s the last little difference I’ll say in the next two or three minutes because we’ll come back to this also. We’ve already seen different Christologies, one of those two bit words again. Whether you believe Jesus was human or divine."
942,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-11,"The Gospel of John is a gospel dramatically different from the Synoptic Gospels. It is full of long dialogues, it speaks of “signs” rather than exorcisms or miracles, and its narrative differs at many points from the Synoptics. Themes in the Gospel are also repeated throughout–themes such as ascending and descending, light and darkness, seeing and knowing. Johannine literature also presents a high Christology that equates Jesus with God. The Gospel also reflects the sectarian nature of the community to which the author belonged.","“In the beginning was the word and the word was with God”–somebody actually has memorized this. It doesn’t sound like Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Most of the time they don’t have a name, most of the time they’d say one or two things to Jesus; one of the longest conversations with Jesus that we have with another character is precisely the Syrophoenician woman you’ve read about, where, you remember she comes and says she wants her daughter to be healed, and she’s not a Jew, and so Jesus says, it’s not right to take bread from the children’s mouths and throw it to the dogs, calling her a dog. This refers to different kinds of John Christianity. In no other Gospel do we get the idea that Jesus existed before his birth. That’s true in some of the other Gospels but it’s just much more so in the Gospel of John. This guy wants you to know from the very beginning John the Baptist is not Jesus’ equal, he’s a secondary witness, just so you don’t get confused. So, for example, sometimes John the Baptist is baptizing and the Gospel of John tells us that Jesus and his disciples are baptizing in another part of the Jordan. Jesus and his disciples over here in another part of the Jordan baptizing their disciples while John is baptizing his disciples? Another big difference, Judea and Galilee. That’s not the way it is in the Gospel of John. It happens the last week of his life right before he is arrested. In fact, the Gospels present that as maybe one of the reasons that he is arrested. Okay, yes it happens at the very beginning of the Gospel. In fact he has–in 7:31 people say, “How can you be the Messiah? He just allows the reader, you the reader, to believe that Jesus really was from Galilee and you know what, that doesn’t matter. At the church where I go the priests, the different priests will actually get down on their hands and knees and put towels around themselves and wash the feet of anybody in the church who comes forward on Thursday night before Easter. The arrest is also very different in the synoptic Gospels. Now tradition has said who is the beloved disciple? This is a puzzle, one of the things that we’ll find is that the Gospel of John likes puzzles, he likes riddles. So what does this mean when Jesus talks about the Son of Man being lifted up? Is he going to go out to the Greeks and preach to the Greeks? Notice the Gospel of John has other differences that I haven’t even mentioned; for example, remember in the Synoptic Gospels there are lots of exorcisms of demons. Look at 2:11, “Jesus did this, the first of his signs,” this is turning the water into the wine, “in Cana of Galilee and revealed his glory and the disciples believed in him.” There were debates about whether it was okay to marry outside of that boundary. They brought him to the Pharisees, the man who had formerly been blind. We keep reading and they go into more and more conflict, look at verse 30, “Then the man answered,” they’re basically saying, look we know Moses, this guy can’t be the Messiah, he must be wrong. Indeed, just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whomever he wishes."
943,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-12,"The Jesus of the Gospel of John often speaks in riddles so that his dialogues with characters such as Nicodemus appear confusing, rather than clarifying. The focus, however, of the Gospel of John is on Christology. In the Gospel, Jesus is divine. So it is also in 1 John, where many of the themes of the Gospel are echoed. 1, 2, and 3 John possibly present us with correspondences of the Johannine community, a sectarian group insisting on the divinity and humanity of Jesus, against the Docetists and other differing forms of early Christianity.","We’re going to continue with the lecture on the Gospel of John that I talked about last time. In order to do this–I talked last time about how one of the things going on in the Gospel of John is Jesus and the Gospel of John seems to start off lots of conversations and they lead to division, so the causation of division is one of the themes of the Gospel of John and to show that we’re going to walk through a couple of chapters. Jesus talks in riddles, so the question we’re going to have is why does Jesus talk in riddles in the Gospel of John? Now this is the one place, basically, in the Bible which born-again kind of language comes out, so it’s kind of ironic that there’s whole branches of American Christianity which base their entire theology and ideology on the idea, have you been born again? Anyway, with all that stuff about wind blowing where it will, so it is with everyone who is born of the spirit Nicodemus tries one more time said to him, “How can these things be?” No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. ”Well at this point Nicodemus just gives up. What is at issue in the Gospel of John is Christology. What I want you to really see is I want you to be able to anchor down, not just take my word for it that well, Professor Martin knows all things about all things, and he tells me that there are these different Christology’s and these different early Christian documents and so that’s what I’m going to write back on a paper. Matthew also believes that Jesus is the Son of God and that he is the Messiah. Look at 1:8:If we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us. It seems like the brothers for this writer are other members of the same community. Remember the word for world I said last time was , the entire universe. If you go to football games anybody know what the most famous football verse is? Look at 3:1:See what love the Father has given us that we should be called children of God, and that is what we are. Because as he is so are we in this world. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love. For example, I think you could definitely prove it with letters of Paul, who specifically uses it for both Gentiles and Jews but only within the body of Christ. Look at 5:1:Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God. Everyone who loves the parent loves the child. This is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment that you have heard from the beginning … Many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. This is a letter that has been sent around, probably with other traveling preachers, but these traveling preachers seem to be representatives of the elder himself, the author. And not content with these charges, he refuses to welcome the friends and even prevents those who want to do so and expels them from the church. Or is this just a split over who gets to be the leader? Four different stages of a church with different kinds of divisions happening and, therefore different, kinds of Christianity developing due to these divisions; very possible. For example, you could just say, well 2 John may have been written to one church and 3 John is written to a totally different geographical region, that’s entirely possible. I think it’s interesting to put them in this way and read them this way, but that’s just one historical reconstruction because a lot of what I’m teaching you is let’s–how do you imagine history developing if all you have are these texts by which you construct the history of the early church?"
944,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-13,"It is obvious that certain narratives in the New Testament contradict each other and cannot be woven into a historically coherent whole. How, then, do scholars construct who the “historical Jesus” was? There are several principles that historical Jesus researchers follow, which include considering data that 1) has multiple attestations and 2) is dissimilar to a text’s theological tendencies as more likely to be historical. Using the modern methods of historical research, it becomes possible to construct a “historical Jesus.”","Okay, we’ve already talked about the problems of using these texts historically. Just to try to figure out how this would work, if you took the birth narratives of Matthew and Luke it would be very, very difficult to find out historically what happened. Does that mean that nobody’s ever tried to do it? That would be the sensible way of doing things. Today we are talking about the historical Jesus but I’m not just going to tell you what I believe or what scholars believe about the historical Jesus, I’m going to try to show you why scholars come up with ideas that we have, how we get there, what is our method for arriving at historical Jesus discussions. But even on this point their testimony did not agree. Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” There are no court records, there are no journalists, nobody was there who later Christians had access to so that they could possibly have known what went on in the trial. Then they make up that likeliness and they put that into the story. You’ve got Jesus as he really was and so therefore Jesus as he really is. No historian believes that George Washington as a child actually chopped down the cherry tree and that happened, and mainly because we actually found the preacher who made up the story for a sermon. Often philosophers of history like to separate these two words out, and they’ll use the word “past” for the event that occurred in the past. The past is non-existent when it comes to our experiences of it. If you want the whole thing, all the answers to life–well I won’t give you cooking recipes and that kind of thing, but if you want all the answers to historical Jesus stuff as it comes from the expert, , you can take my seminar in the fall that I’ll be teaching on the historical Jesus; a whole semester just on the historical Jesus question, so I’ll do that in the fall. Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews,” and doesn’t it say in John that it was in different languages or am I–  That’s right; Hebrew, Latin, and Greek in the Gospel of John, so that’s what we’ve got. Well, for one thing, it comes from at least two independent sources, right? Not according to the theory we’re using in this class. So what scholars have said is, look, this thing King of the Jews doesn’t look like a Christological confessional title that Christians made up and then put into the Gospel. Again, scholars say, the baptism of John the Baptist baptizing Jesus doesn’t look like something early Christians would make up. Right now let’s talk about method, how did I get here? If you also have something in the Gospel of Thomas then most of us scholars would say, well some people say the Gospel of Thomas may have known the other Gospels, but most of us would say, we’re going to treat him as an independent source because he’s not verbatim quoting the other Gospels most of the time. What if it also occurs in Paul, Paul’s letters? Something that swims against the tide of early Christian expectation. I don’t think early Christians invented it. Because it’s not something they would have invented. Because early followers of Jesus believed Jesus was God in some sense. Because there were twelve tribes of Israel that would be reconstituted at the end of time according to Jewish expectation. On the other hand, he was executed for being King of the Jews. That’s all you get on the historical Jesus, sorry."
945,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-14,"The New Testament and other texts provide us with many accounts of the Apostle Paul, some that contradict each other. Throughout the history of Christianity, Paul has assumed many different roles for different people. For the early Christians he was primarily a martyr. For St. Augustine, and later Martin Luther, he was a man interpreting the Gospel through his psychological struggle with guilt. The historical Paul seems to have been a man preaching an apocalyptic message to the gentiles.","The last time we talked about the historical Jesus, and I talked about some of the methodology that scholars debate about what criteria you use to figure out what in the Gospels might tell you something about the actual historical Jesus and what may be later writing, or myths, or legends, or editions of the Gospel writers themselves. Then we have some other letters that are written in his name. What I’ve said is Paul probably didn’t spend nearly as much time in Jerusalem as the Acts of the Apostles wants to make it sound like. And then all of a sudden Luther discovers, when he read Galatians and Romans, wait we’re saved by faith apart–we’re saved by grace through faith apart from works, therefore works don’t matter, therefore all the Roman Catholic requirements that we have to do this, and that, and that, that’s not where salvation comes from, it comes from simply your faith. In fact, people have said the message of Jesus was about God and the Kingdom. He says that he was a persecutor of the church before he became a follower of Jesus, and he implies that this was out of zeal for the law. As I’ve tried to get you to see, there are a lot of things in the Acts of the Apostles that we should doubt their historicity, especially when it comes to Paul. And Paul went in, as was his custom, and on three Sabbath days argued with them from the scriptures, explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Messiah to suffer and to rise from the dead and saying, “This is the Messiah, the Christ, Jesus, whom I am proclaiming to you.” That very night the believers sent Paul and Silas off to Berea, and when they arrived they went to the Jewish synagogue. The Greek  can include women but it’s just the masculine Greek word, “brothers,” here that’s in the text. At least here we get a definite indication from his own letters that Paul was a manual laborer, he worked with his hands. He doesn’t tell us exactly in his letters what he did. They practiced manual labor when they were there. They’re not experiencing persecution from Jews, they’re experiencing it from Greeks. In 1 Thessalonians we don’t have a schematic history, we probably have a much better idea of what actually happened, which was that Paul founded this church with Gentile believers and when they experienced persecution it wasn’t from the Romans and it wasn’t from Jews, it was from their neighbors. In a rank of descending probability, 2 Thessalonians, Colossians, and Ephesians are doubted as being truly by the Apostle Paul. Keep that in mind when we talk about this. Notice he says nothing about any concern for the woman. These people did not know what happened to dead people in Christ. Paul says, wait, I forgot to tell you something, there will be people that die. The very thing that most of us modern people think you become a Christian for–which is immortal life or the immorality of the soul, or life after death–the Thessalonians didn’t know anything about. It gives us a very interesting sense of what kind of group this was, that they didn’t know something about Christianity, the resurrection of Christians at the end of time, that’s so much part of the Creeds, part of modern faith, part of faith of the last 2,000 years, and these early converts to this group didn’t seem to know it. Now it’s not because he doesn’t address women in other letters, and other letters Paul does talk to women even by name. When he talks to men he talks to women, he addresses women’s problems in different letters, but in 1 Thessalonians he never talks to a woman at all, and he only talks about women when he’s talking about men trying to get them to control themselves sexually."
946,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-15,"1 Corinthian and 2 Corinthians give us several snapshots of the development of the Corinthian church and Paul’s relationship to it. In 1 Corinthians Paul is concerned with controversies that have been dividing the church, most probably along social status lines. The issues causing controversy include whether one should eat food sacrificed to idols, how one ought to conduct oneself sexually, the practice of speaking in tongues, and how Christians will be resurrected from the dead. 2 Corinthians shows that these issues seem to have been resolved. However, 2 Corinthians 10-13 (probably a separate letter) presents Paul in a defensive posture, struggling to justify his position over and against the new “super apostles” that have infiltrated the Corinthian church.","The situation with Paul’s church in Corinth is very different from the situation we saw in 1 Thessalonians. Look at 1 Corinthians 15–take your Bibles out, remember you have to follow along–1 Corinthians 15; this is when Paul is addressing the issue of the resurrection of the body. Verse 25: “For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet, for the last enemy to be destroyed is death.” It looks like not, it looks like what they’re really questioning is simply the resurrection of the body idea, because of course they’re saying–they might be thinking like a lot of people in the ancient world, there were other–lots of Jews believed in the resurrection of the body and so it was an idea that was not unknown to people but think if the people in the ancient world also objected by saying, but how is that possible? Does anybody’s translation have something different at that verse? In the ancient world  is like–is a stuff, it’s like what air is made out of. Just as we are born in the image of the man of dust, we will also bear the image of the man of heaven. First a little background on what this is. It had been refounded again in the 40s and then settled with Roman veterans. And Paul has gotten his information about what’s going on at the church in Corinth from several different sources. She might be because Paul names her out by name, but we don’t know that for sure, but at least some of the members of her household are, and they have gone to Paul and told him stuff that’s going on. It’s not all one group meeting all the time in one place. We can imagine different house churches meeting in different places and maybe made up of different kinds of people. In 1 Corinthians 1:26 we get our first major clue, “Consider your own call brothers and sisters not many of you,” again the Greek doesn’t have “sisters” they’ve added into the English to make it more inclusive. “ It’s also when you add in issues like, might this text not only have something to say about theology but also about issues like social class and power, and scholars have said it’s precisely in 1 Corinthians, it’s one of the places we see in the New Testament, the best evidence we have that the early churches weren’t all homogeneous when it comes to their social status level and they may have actually experienced conflicts in their groups due precisely to differences in social status and social power. Some people have said these may actually represent four different specific delineable parties in Corinth. because there are actually several different issues on sexual conduct in Corinthians. I argued that the Corinthian church, which, remember, was in different house churches, and it may have been that one house church tended to be on one side, and another house church tended to be on another, we don’t know that. Imagine what you have is a potluck like this. The resurrection of the body, I said who would have found the resurrection of the body to be a ridiculous idea, people with more education, people exposed to a little bit more education. If you have a dispute let it be handled within the church itself. Now notice again, just like he talked about Philemon last time, who would have been the majority in the Corinthian church, rich people or poor people? We do have 2 Corinthians, which is made up of at least two other letters. His speaking style, well this was a social status thing. And I haven’t even talked about Philippians because I wanted to make sure that you understood what was going on in scholarly opinion about the Corinthian epistles."
947,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-16,"The Apostle Paul’s description of the Jewish Law in his letter to the Galatians demotes from being an expression of Jewish faith to an object of idolatry and one that imprisons those who follow it. Paul is careful to nuance this position, however, in his letter to the Romans. In Romans, it seems that Paul is defending himself against charges of being antinomian. Perhaps Paul treads carefully in order to ensure that his deliverance of a donation to the Jerusalem church from the gentile churches is received in a spirit of church unity.","Paul founded several, probably small, house churches in the area of Galatia. For through the law I died to the law so that I might live to God. Notice he’s separating out faith and law, that’s not something that almost any Jew would do. Notice what he’s doing here, he differentiates the law from promise, which would be very odd coming for a Jew at the time. Now the law becomes a prison guard that keeps humanity, and he seems to talking about all of humanity not just Jews, somehow the law, the Jewish law put all of humanity in prison and kept it there all those years. By calling the law a pedagogue here, I don’t think Paul’s saying that the law was our teacher, I think what he’s saying is the law is that slave, a serviling who kept us basically enslaved; remember he just said we’re prisoners. Wait minute, Hagar is the  of Abraham not his wife. Now he gets another Jerusalem, now there’s some kind of heavenly Jerusalem that’s–what’s represented by Sarah. “ If he’s equated the slave woman Hagar with Mt. Sinai, with Jerusalem in Judea, it seems like he’s equating Hagar with the Jews, at least the law observant Jews, and he says, drive them out? It’s no wonder that all this stuff got Paul into trouble. He says no, no, no, no by no means; that’s not what I mean. Look what he says in 3:21, right below that: “But now apart from law the righteousness of God has been disclosed, and it is attested by the law and the prophets.” Now if I do what I do not want I agree that the law is good, but in fact it is no longer I that do it, but the sin that dwells in me. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do. So why these differences between Romans and Galatians? Well we need to understand a little bit more about the Roman situation. He greets the Jews who are there that he knows. For one thing he can’t write like he’s written most of his other letters as talking to a group he founded. For I do hope to see you on my journey and to be sent on by you once I have enjoyed your company for a little while. Yep, everything in Greece and Asia Minor, my churches are all doing great, I got to get out of here, my work here is done. What he’s doing is saying, I want a little contribution from you so I want some support from you, both symbolic support and financial support. He’s, in a sense, trying to get the Roman Christians on his side before his trip to Jerusalem. Scholars have said now, look to the end of Romans, chapter 9-11 the latter part of Romans, that’s where you’ll see what the real point of Romans is, and it’s not about individual salvation. It’s about the relationship between the nations–when I say “Gentiles” remember that’s just a term that Jews used for all the nations except themselves, so when I say “the nations” I mean all non-Jewish peoples in the ancient world. They’ll bring gifts; they’ll all worship the God of Israel. And the Gentiles, who are not natural branches of the olive tree, have been grafted in their place. That at the end of this cosmos, the end of this world, the Messiah would come, overthrow the oppressors of the Jews, set up Jerusalem as the center of the earth."
948,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-17,"In ancient times, documents that were falsely attributed to an author, called pseudepigrapha, were a common phenomenon. Both the Letters to the Colossians and Ephesians are most likely pseudonymous works attributed to the Apostle Paul. The writer of Colossians assures his readers that they already possess all the benefits of salvation and do not need to observe rules concerning feast days, Sabbaths, and worship of the angels. Ephesians seems somewhat based on Colossians, although it reads more like an ethical or moral treatise. Both letters differ from Pauline Christology in their realized eschatology and high Christology.","King Abgar over in the East Syrian region writes to Jesus saying, “I’ve heard this great stuff about you, I’m a little sick, can you come heal me? Decide you’re just going to do something wild and crazy and have an opinion. I, II, III John, actually they don’t claim to be by John. Almost no scholar believes they all are by Plato. Remember I’ve talked about how Paul’s letters can be divided up into three camps, the undisputed seven letters which are listed–I’ve already listed them for you and I’m not going to do it now, they’re also in your textbook, and then there’s the letters that almost all scholars, critical scholars, believe are pseudepigraphic, which are I and II Timothy and Titus. Say it has very elaborate sentences whereas your first paper had sort of straightforward simple sentences. I kept using relative pronouns like “who did this,” “which this,” and using ing-words, participles, because that’s what you use in the Greek to string along clause after clause after clause. You can search all the way through the seven authentic letters of Paul and you just tell–especially the Ephesians passage, it just doesn’t sound like Paul. Paul writes fairly straightforward sentences. They’re very, very different as far just the style of the writing and the Greek. Other people could say, well there’s also the vocabulary, the vocabulary is quite a bit different in Colossians and Ephesians. I think, though, that Ephesians came along and was written by somebody else using Colossians as a model. Why is one style his and one style– Okay the question is what says that the seven that I’ve called the undisputed letters are actually Paul and the others are not Paul? Now there are scholars who will doubt some of those seven also, one of the seven, but it’s sort of like somebody else said, well I don’t believe Romans and Galatians were by Paul, than I kind of say, well then they’re written by another Apostle who was named Paul and had the exact same ideas and the same writing style. 1:19:For in Him, that is in Christ  all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross. The only thing these people haven’t experienced, that they will experience in heaven, according to this author, is simply the revelation of their glory. Colossians has a realized eschatology and Paul has a reserved eschatology, and this is one of the major theological differences between Paul’s undisputed letters and Colossians, that some of us scholars grasp onto to say it’s not Pauline. Now Ephesians uses Colossians as a model and then just builds on it even more. I’ve been justified but I haven’t been saved. they’re using theology from Ephesians perhaps, or from Colossians, but it doesn’t really fit Paul’s theology. The PhD was mainly on foul language in early Christianity. The writer to Ephesians condemns that kind of language. He just noticed that these two writers are very similar in some ways but when it comes down to what counts as shameful speech, the writer of the Ephesians considered shameful speech even to include witticisms, making jokes, that also was considered shameful speech. This has led some scholars to say maybe Ephesians was written as a circular letter. In fact some people have even said, maybe Ephesians was written when a collection of Paul’s letters was made and some scribe or editor decided, well I’m going to write an introductory letter that will encapsulate Paul’s Gospel in Paul’s message, and I’m going to do it in a very elevated style, and we’ll put that at the beginning of the collection to sort of be an introductory letter for all the collection of Paul’s letters. In other words, for Paul all the enjoyments that Christians would experience are still in the future. Another major difference is Colossians and Ephesians have a slightly higher Christology. This is much more hierarchical and pro-household than what you get in Paul’s authentic letters."
949,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-18,"Early Christianity presents us with a wide diversity in attitudes towards the law. There were also many different Christologies circulating in different communities. The book of James presents one unique perspective. It seems to be written in the tradition of Jewish wisdom literature in its presentation of sayings and its concern for the poor. James also presents a view of works and faith that seems to oppose Pauline teaching. However, the terms “faith” and “works” function differently in Paul’s writings and in the book of James.","We’ve reviewed several times already, at least some of the stuff for your paper this week, if you’re writing a paper on Judaism and the law in early Christianity; different varieties. How many different kinds of early Christianities there were, and one of the important things is–or ways to look at that, is what were their different views of the law, so of course with Matthew, as we’ve seen, Matthew treats the law, the Jewish law, as something that apparently he considers his–the followers of his own church to continue to keep. There’s no hint in Matthew that the law would be abrogated. Paul has a much more radical position and we could look at others. He was the first one to come up with a canon list, we think, and then he edited those to where anything positive about the Jewish law or the God of the Jews was taken out because he believed that was a junior false bad god and not the Father of Jesus Christ. They believed that Jesus  the Son of God. He’s argued that he thinks that maybe the text originally said, “today I have begotten you,” and orthodox scribes took it out in the second century. Is this a hint that there were other Christians who believed that Jesus was human until he was raised from the dead and that’s when he became divine and the Son of God? There you almost get the idea that Paul believed that Jesus was in a preexistent state as the Son of God, so this may not be Paul’s own considered theology or Christology, and therefore some scholars have said maybe he’s quoting a line that he gets from someplace else. When did Jesus become divine according to the Gospel of John? The Jews had lots of kings that were not divine. It might, but it didn’t necessarily at all. This is the take that most followers of Jesus end up taking, although there were some followers of Jesus who existed all the way into the second century who believed he was purely human. I do this just to show these diversities are there. Abraham believed God and it was reckoned to him as righteousness. Then Paul goes on and takes his argument further. Now look back at James 1, first chapter of James, verses 22-25:But be doers of the word and not merely hearers who deceive themselves. But those who look into the perfect law, the law of liberty and persevere, not being hearers who forgot but doers who act, they will be blessed in their doing. Now these texts seem to be arguing against Paul, and it makes us wonder, does the author actually have texts of Paul in front of him? Or has he heard about Paul’s Gospel about a works free Gospel in some places and he’s responding to rumors? For Martin Luther works were indulgences sold by the Roman Catholic Church. And here’s the debate among scholars, some people have given this answer of why James and Paul don’t really disagree. Because, as some of you already picked up, they’re working with what seem to be different definitions of both faith and works."
950,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-19,"In the undisputed Pauline epistles, marriage is seen as a way to extirpate sexual desire - neither as a means for procreation nor as the preferred social status. The Pastoral Epistles, written to instruct in the pastoring of churches and appointing of church offices, presents quite un-Pauline attitudes. In the Pastoral Epistles, the church, rather than an, becomes a household, a specifically patriarchal structure in which men hold offices and women are not to have authority over them. They present a pro-family, anti-ascetic message in contrast to the Pauline epistles.","What we’re doing this week is extending our conversation we started last week about how was Paul used as a figure in early Christianity. It is interesting that when we talked about Marcion early, remember the heretic in Rome who made his own first Canon list of New Testament books? Remember he included Luke as his Gospel in his own edited version of it and he included the letters of Paul. Notice he’s basically saying, have sex within marriage. What Paul wants is for them to experience sexual intercourse, even in marriage, without any erotic desire. And the debate is whether he’s talking about their genitalia, which is one possible interpretation of the Greek, or their wife’s body, which is another possible interpretation of the Greek. The one thing he does seem to be anti is desire, sexual desire. So by the time Paul writes I Corinthians, women are acknowledged as an important part of his churches. Well how would that happen?Well, the idea goes that some scribe, at some point, was copying over I Corinthians 14 and got to the point where this is in the text and wrote out in the margin, well wait a minute this is not right because of course the scribes are living at a later time when women definitely were in a more inferior position in churches. There are places where Paul is willing to talk to women as leaders of churches. Interestingly enough, that word “Junia,” that might be in your translation as “Junia” nowadays, but in older English versions, it was translated as “Junias,” which would be a man’s name. Is he for egalitarian theology with men and women? They’re teaching myths, they’re teaching asceticism, they’re teaching the avoidance of marriage, well that does look a bit like other early Christian, second century Christian groups, some of whom their opponents would call Gnostics, but we don’t have enough information for it to be easy to tell. It was this thing that came into the cosmos as an invader, it enslaved humanity, it was the pedagogue that swatted humanity down when humanity was in its childish state. It’s only for people who are sinners who can’t control themselves. Paul never talked about the church as if it just had the same structure of a household. I Timothy 3:14:I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these instructions to you so that if I am delayed you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and bulwark of the truth. It’s the assembly of the city-state that came together for political purposes and to vote. Yet she will be saved through childbearing, provided they continue in faith and love and holiness with modesty. Either way you look at it, this author really wants women to be in a subordinate role, silent in church. For if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how can he take care of God’s church?Again the church is a household. The other office he talks about in 5:17, “Let the elders,” now just as the word we translated “bishop” or “overseer,” comes from the Greek word , the Greek for elder here is , presbyter, and this is where the Presbyterian church gets the name of its church. Apparently this author believes in marriage and wants people to be married, but his ideal is that people should be married once. This led to what is currently the practice in many of the eastern churches. Already in Colossians and Ephesians we had what we called the household codes: masters treat your slaves well; slaves be obedient to your masters; husbands treat your wives well; wives submit to your husbands; children submit to your fathers; fathers treat your children–these are called household codes."
951,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-1,"This course approaches the New Testament not as scripture, or a piece of authoritative holy writing, but as a collection of historical documents. Therefore, students are urged to leave behind their pre-conceived notions of the New Testament and read it as if they had never heard of it before. This involves understanding the historical context of the New Testament and imagining how it might appear to an ancient person.","This is Introduction to New Testament History and Literature. So one of the things that– if you’re here to learn about the New Testament because it’s scripture, the class may disappoint you, from that point of view. 2) This quotation: “Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” 3) At Jesus’ birth three wise men or three kings visited the Baby Jesus. From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.” ( 5) The Doctrine of the Trinity; is it in the Bible? ( 8) After his death, Jesus appeared to his disciples in Jerusalem. After his death, Jesus appeared to his disciples in Galilee. Tenth and Last: Peter was martyred by being crucified upside down. Somebody explain why the Doctrine of the Trinity is not in the Bible. It illustrates again this idea that how much of this ancient text is it important for you to know, on its own terms, in its historical context in the first century, or how is it important for you to know in the way it’s been interpreted for the last 2000 years?And what I am telling you is kind of contrary to the way I’m going to teach this course. Most people would say that Christians or religious people believe in the immortality of the soul, and that is part of a good bit of Christian doctrine. My point is to get you to see that when we study this text in this class, we’re not going to be studying it necessarily as scripture, as the Word of God. We’re going to look at what it meant in the first century. They have a conception of what the Bible is. Now the reason that is true is because we live in a post-Christian culture, and both aspects of that term are important. If you were an ancient person and you picked up the Gospel of Matthew and you heard these stories about these kings from the East, following a star and arriving and finding this baby, that would sound–you know, okay, this is going to be somebody great. This is telling you that this is himself a king or somebody great. That’s odd in itself, from our point of view; or it should look odd to us. They’re quite a bit like ancient letters. And apocalypse just means opening up, revelation. And finally it ends up with the establishment of a new world and a new City of God. At these town meetings they eat meals–which is not unusual since most clubs in your society eat meals–but they call the meals “the boss’s dinner,” or sometimes “the thank you.” So all of these different things– the part about it, it doesn’t matter whether you’re a man and woman, Christians went around saying things like, “In Christ there is no male and female.” What we’re going to do is we’re going to take the New Testament, and we’re going to take the different writings, and we’re going to take them apart. How they treated women, different ways that women could take a place in this movement. And it’s just been published in an English translation. And that may bring up chances to talk about literature also. In fact, sometimes that’ll help us because we’ll compare translations."
952,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-20,"The  has a narrative quite similar to those in ancient Greco-Roman novels: Thecla becomes enamored of Paul and they share a number of adventures. However, the  redirects eroticism towards a belief in a gospel of purity and asceticism. The  present an ascetic, anti-marriage, anti-family message that would break the cycle of sex, birth, death, and decay that was so obvious in the ancient world. Given that Thecla emerges from the story as the true hero (and not Paul), is it possible to read the story as a feminist one?","I hope you read it before class as the syllabus instructed you to. This is not part of the apocrypha that’s published in your Bible, your study Bible if you bought the Bible that I requested which was the Oxford Study Bible with Apocrypha. That apocrypha, as I explained at the beginning of the whole semester is Jewish literature that was written sometime in the Second Temple period and it’s not explicitly Christian literature for the most part. This is because I teach New Testament studies and the history of early Christianity almost like ethnography. The next best thing is to have sex if you need just to make babies, but then as soon as you have your babies, stop having sex and be ascetic the rest of your life. When people talk about that being the Christian thing they’re forgetting the vast sweep of Christian history. They’re both madly in love with each other. Anyway a beautiful young woman and they decide, well great this–we can get more for her than from the stuff in here. He falls in love with her, so he decides to marry her. He’s teaching unmarried women not to get married and young men not to get married. Civilization is going to fall apart, in their view. Paul feared nothing but comported himself with full confidence in God, and her faith was also increased as she kissed his fetters. Blessed are they who have renounced this world for they shall be well pleasing unto God. You must, he says, fear one single God only and live chastely. Also, the bad guys in this are anti-ascetic. Demos is a bad guy here who had been a follower of Paul but he’s now betraying Paul. The enemies of Paul, and the gospel here, are the anti-ascetics, and of course that makes you think, who does this look like that we’ve been reading lately who says, “Drink a little wine for your stomach’s sake”? It’s male to penetrate; it’s feminine to be penetrated. The other big thing that changed was the Pill. We have enough reliable means of contraception that we can pretty much decide that we want to have sex just for fun without worrying about pregnancy. Before that, and here’s what goes back to the ancient world, I’ve mentioned this before and we’ve been talking about other texts already but just to review: for the ancient mind, sex was simply one cog in a wheel. The idea was you have sex, birth, death, decay. Notice paragraph 26 and 27: this guy sees Thecla in a different place, Alexander sees Thecla, and he falls in love with her. By tearing his clothes, by knocking his crown off, she shames him in public, and this of course totally disrupts this hierarchy of the man over the woman, and that’s part of what’s going on here. And so that’s what the conflict is about, shaming men and rebelling against the household structure. I guess she and her mother, by the end of the thing, are now on good terms. Thecla becomes her own Apostle spreading the message. Is it possible or conceivable that a woman would have written it?"
953,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-21,"There are many ways of interpreting the text, and ancient methods of interpretation may seem bizarre to our modern sensibilities. The New Testament offers us many examples of how an early Christian might interpret the text of the Hebrew Bible, which was their scripture. The Letter to the Hebrews, which is not really a letter but a speech of encouragement, structures its argument around the thesis that Jesus’ liturgy and priesthood is superior to that in the Hebrew Bible. The author of Hebrews proves this through several interesting interpretations of passages from the Hebrew Bible.","We last week talked about the issue of women and early Christianity, and I obviously didn’t address all the different texts in early Christianity that are relevant for your discussion last week on women. This will be a lecture on Hebrews to kind of talk about the content of the letter of the Hebrews, but the main–it’s also used to shift our gears away from a purely historical critical analysis of scripture and show how ancient people did it themselves. It’s so brilliant and so wonderfully written. I published the book last summer, it’s called, , and I’ll set that in a little bit of context. Some of them were very conservative, with conservative denominations in churches; some were very liberal and progressive. Is it in somehow the literal words, how they would be read by an educated, intelligent, native speaker? You could also say, well that’s probably not what Luke meant, what the author of Luke meant to say, because Luke seems to have other passages in Luke and Acts where it seems he’s accepting that Jesus was divine in some sense before his baptism, maybe even at his birth, because the angels announce it, and there’s the worship of Jesus that happens then. You see how we would not accept that interpretation of this text, right? You’re getting these numbers and you could make numbers mean all kinds of things. Now of course, notice it’s already put in a patriarchal context because it’s not about how a wife can divorce her husband, or how both of them can divorce one another. I know they’re rhetorical questions but just answer them anyway, okay? In other words, if you have a text that you’re not clear about the interpretation of it, it’s okay in ancient interpretation theory to go to another text that might shed light on that cloudy text. Some people think it got into the Canon precisely because some people claimed, oh well it’s really by Paul after all. There have been guesses all over the place. Some people say Luke wrote it because it looks like a very–it looks very good Greek. Well, sometimes people say it was Luke, the physician, who also was the author of Luke and Acts, and then also of Hebrews. Some people have said Apollos, because remember Apollos is called in Acts someone who really has a good gift of speech. All these are dualisms that come up in sort of popular Platonizing rhetoric of the time. But Jews used it also in reading scripture. Then you’ve got, I put them in bold, a digression, a kind of excursus in the main outline, and these are very important because these are very skillful digressions that will foreshadow something that’s going to come up later in the same sermon. Now this is where you get this thing of the reality is always superior to the shadow and he makes Jesus and the liturgy, the service, the worship that Jesus introduces superior to the shadow that is the previous Jewish high priesthood and tabernacle liturgy. The basic point of the letter then is this superiority of Jesus’ , this is from the Greek word–this is where we get the English word “liturgy.” Well it can even refer to Christ in 11:26, Christ can be the speaker in scripture. And he comes to this placed called Salem, which just happens to be Jerusalem. Even Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils. But this man who does not belong to their ancestry  paid tithes through Abraham for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him. What proves the bishop’s superiority is his blessing you in the first place, so that proves that Melchizedek was superior to Abraham."
954,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-22,"The principles of interpreting the New Testament in this course assume a historical critical perspective. The historical critical method of interpreting a text privileges the intended meaning of the ancient author, the interpretation of a text’s original audience, the original language the text was written in, and the avoidance of anachronism. However, for most of the last two thousand years, this has  been the method of interpretation of the Bible. Pre-modern interpreters, such as Origen and Augustine, felt free to allegorize and use the text as they saw fit. It was only through the Reformation and other events in modern history that the historical critical method became the predominant method of interpretation.","Last time I talked about the Letter to the Hebrews and I used it mainly as an example of early Christian interpretation of scripture. And then the writer takes Melchizedek to be a type, a sign of Jesus and his priesthood. When you talk about Christian supercessionist kind of language–and the term just means the traditional Christian teachings which you’ve seen throughout two thousand years of Christianity, that Christianity is superior to Judaism–when you see that kind of supercessionist kind of language in the New Testament, it’s not in Paul so much. They arise as a support for biblical studies. The Elohist is a strain that uses the term  for God, so scholars said these are originally two different things. These are basic aspects of modern historical criticism. The last big, big boogey man of historical criticism is eisegesis. Because this is reading into the text something that’s not in the text, and they’re playing off the word, of course I’ve used this before, exegesis. Well, veils don’t mean that in our culture, so we don’t have to obey that text like it’s a rule. They will talk about–and they might not use the term “gap” but that’s what I call it–what they’re doing is saying, there is a gap between their culture and their world and ours. Of course then they start realizing that different people can interpret scripture differently. It was what they took it to be the most fundamental plain sense meaning of the text. And then you have a rise of so many Protestant movements that the idea that scripture alone could settle debates and give you a foundation started becoming questionable. It was elaborated and invented in the nineteenth century, and in some places it was precisely invented in order to try to make the text of the New Testament and the Bible a firm foundation for doctrine and ethics within Protestantism and within the wide of varieties of different kinds of Protestantism. Why have I first been teaching you the historical critical method? The teaching fellows know very little about art history also. But the most important, throughout history, has been basically a two part division. So an anagogical reading would lead you to something else and the varieties of different ways of reading the text. Origen has a problem because Christians all know that it’s wrong to use witches, and here’s the King Saul using a witch. But in this case, Origin this great allegorizer ,is insisting on the literal reading. First he says the woman really did see Samuel. I had already learned to feel for my past sins an anger with myself that would hold me back from sinning again. We think of that as seeing space, but ancient people didn’t. And so he interprets allegorically to say scripture. I thank him, too, for the kiss of the hand, but if he has genuine regard for me, let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth. I concentrate on spiritual studies, resist vices, and pray often. As far as I can judge I have lived among the brethren without quarrel. The last part is a monk talking, not a virgin girl. This is part of the remarkable reading of the text of the Bible that you get in a pre-modern world where they seem to feel remarkably free to read these texts as containing a lot more meanings than a historian like me would see them containing."
955,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-23,"The Apocalypse, or the Revelation of John, shares many of the traits found in apocalyptic literature: it operates in dualisms–earthly events contrasted with heavenly ones, present time with the imminent future, and it calls for cultural and political resistance. Its structure is like a spiral, presenting cycle after cycle of building tension and reprieve, so that the reader who experiences the text also experiences crisis and then catharsis. Politically, Revelation equates Rome with Babylon and the empire as the domain of Satan.","The word “apocalypse” is the Greek word that is translated as “revelation” because that’s exactly what it means, “an uncovering.” I don’t know why people think that “Revelations” is the name of the book. They usually have a chronological span of time. The Prince of Judah, the angel of Judah tends to be Michael or some other angel that you’ve probably heard of, like Raphael. We’re not going to talk about what they actually saw or what happened. And that meant they thought, oh the end time must have already started because he has been raised. One of the interesting things about all of Revelation is its structure. I talked about Hebrews last week and I gave you an outline to the letter to the Hebrews to show you that it was a very elaborately structured sermon. But it does have a fairly intricate and interesting structure, and I call this a structure of cycles, the spiral. I’ve titled your outline “a spiral outline of Revelation” because the story–a lot of people have read Revelation–well, let me also back up and explain what’s different this week from what we did last week. When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature call out, “Come!” When he opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth living creature call out, “Come!” They were given authority over a fourth of the earth to kill with the sword, famine, and pestilence, and by the wild animals of the earth. The fifth seal has something like a digression, the fifth seal is not another horse like you expect. There’s almost no women in this text at all. When he talks about seeing the sky rolled up like a scroll he means that quite literally. Isn’t that interesting, you have another use of the term seal but now this is a seal that’s put on the faces of all the people who are the true followers, who are the true Israel, twelve tribes like the twelve tribe–the lost ten tribes and the other two tribes of Israel. There’s the reconstituting of Israel now, and they’re sealed, and the seal is a good thing. Another angel of the golden censor came and stood by the altar. Then you have the sixth seal which is another worse thing than all of these, it’s really, really bad and its goes on longer, and then you have this long digression again, this is like the fifth seal, it’s a sealing of the followers of Jesus with salvation. And then in 11:14 you have the end of the second woe. And, remember, it’s meant to be performed. We know it is because in 17:9,18 he talks about this city being on seven hills, referring to the famous Seven Hills of Rome. Some people actually believe that Revelation was written in the 60s when Nero was himself the emperor. The writer is giving this big myth, obviously the whore is killed, Babylon is killed, Rome is destroyed, all the wealthy people are destroyed, all the kings of the earth are destroyed by the angels and by Jesus coming down. Maybe this guy, and this is just a theory, but I think it’s fun to think about, maybe he’s actually writing to Paul’s churches precisely because he thinks they’re too comfortable with Roman rule, and he wants to make them uncomfortable with Roman rule in order to turn them against Rome and to convert him to his own vision about this anti-Roman version of the Gospel. And that’s why he constructs the letter to say, as I said, if you’re troubled, if you feel like you’re oppressed you’re supposed to be comforted by this text."
956,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-24,"The Apocalypse of John showed an anti-Roman, politically revolutionary perspective. This is in contrast with Paul’s writing in Romans 13, which calls for submission to governmental authorities - although passages in 1 Corinthians may be said to contradict this. 2 Thessalonians, a pseudonymous letter, also preaches a politically conservative and accommodative message, as does 1 Peter. Interestingly, these letters do not discard or ignore apocalypticism but use it quite differently from the author of Revelation to further their message of political conservatism. 2 Peter seems to be a letter dating from the second century, from the post-apostolic age. In 2 Peter, the apocalypse is no longer imminent and is not used to further any admonition. Instead, it has become simply a part of Christian doctrine.","Last time we talked about the Book of Revelation, and I ended up by trying to place Revelation in the context of Roman politics in the imperial cult. Maybe he lived through that war and that increased his hatred of the Romans. There was no coherent persecution attempt by the Romans against the Jesus movement at any time until much later in history. But remember what Paul said in Romans 13:Let every person be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those authorities that exist have been instituted by God. It is the servant of God to execute wrath on the wrongdoer. We’ve already got now two seemingly opposite positions. Is he here talking about these authorities who crucified Jesus, that is the Romans? It’s complicated, and so it’s a good thing for you to look at. Why is it that I say I don’t think 2 Thessalonians is by Paul?Well, for one thing, this is not so important, but we’ll get to it a minute, he actually has a message in 2 Thessalonians about the coming of Jesus that seems to contradict what he had been saying in 1 Thessalonians. If Paul is going to sit down and write another letter to 2 Thessalonians is he going to do so with the copy of 1 Thessalonians in front of him? In other words, I think 2 Thessalonians, in certain parts of it, look suspiciously too much like 1 Thessalonians to be an authentic letter by Paul. Sometimes if you’re writing a pseudonymous letter you’ll put a reference saying, well now some people have been circulating pseudonymous letters by me and I condemn them for it. This is something like another sort of antichrist figure that we’ve seen in the Book of Daniel, Jesus and his own little apocalypse in Mark 13, and other places talk about the abomination of desolation being set up in the temple. And you know what is now restraining him so that he may be revealed when his time comes. And then the lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord Jesus will destroy with the breath of his mouth, annihilating him by the manifestation of his coming. It may not also be completely positive either because he still sees Rome apparently as being destroyed in the end. The reasons are, again, numerous, and, notice, this is not an anonymous letter like the letters of John are that don’t claim to be written by John. But he’s clearly including Gentile Christians in this too, so he’s talking about followers of Jesus who live in all this different geographical area, and again, this is sort of what we would now call Turkey, the area of Turkey. Can you imagine the author of Revelation saying that? Not only those who are kind and gentle but also those who are harsh. For one reason, he wants these groups of followers of Jesus not to be disrespected by outsiders. Notice what he’s doing, he actually calls Paul’s letters scripture. You just don’t have in early Christianity, the automatic acceptance of Paul’s occasional letters, because they were letters written to real situations, being elevated now to the status of holy writing, scripture. Then one last thing that is interesting to talk about, keep your finger there in 2 Peter but we’re going to look at Jude, so flip over to Jude which is right before Revelation. He edits out of Jude stuff, that by that time, he believes is not really part of Christian scripture."
957,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-25,"The Epistle of Jude can be dated to somewhere during post-apostolic Christianity and before the formation of the Canon. It refers to the apostles as representing a prior generation, yet it quotes from texts later excluded (perhaps, for example, by 2 Peter) from the Canon. The letters of Ignatius of Antioch contain evidence of a move toward the institutionalization of early Christianity. It mentions, for example, three different church offices: bishops, presbyters, and deacons. It also heavily emphasizes the authority held by those with these titles. The  contains liturgical and ritual instructions for rites such as baptism, the Lord’s Prayer, and the Eucharist. All these documents show the change in early Christianity toward greater church structure and institutionalization.","Okay we’re going to talk about several different things today, several different texts, because we’re coming up to the end of the semester. Today we’re taking a first step toward that because I’m going to look at some canonical material in this lecture, but I’m also going to look at the letters of Ignatius and the  to show you how the church started becoming institutionalized in ways that look more familiar to us after the period of the New Testament composition. There are different ways you can see this being done in early Christianity. Paul couldn’t say something like, if you have a question go to your bishop. Gradually, of course, you have other ways of developing. It looks very much like American politics. Then you have other churches in America that are very free churches. They basically preach and teach, but they’re not the ones who actually run the churches, so each individual church–there are lots of churches like that in the United States. Of course in America this is not at all unusual. You would go in, and although everything was in Japanese, it was exactly like it was back in Texas. What most scholars think is that this pseudonymous, you won’t be surprised now to know that we don’t think the brother of Jesus or the brother of James actually wrote this text. This faith is this thing that was delivered to the saints at one time. He also, as I said last time, he cites some Enoch material in verses 14 and 15.It was also about these that Enoch in the seventh generation from Adam prophesied saying, “See the Lord is coming with ten thousands of his Holy ones. Along the way, he writes these letters when he’s going through Asia Minor, to different cities in Asia Minor, sort of like the author of Revelation had done. Pray, leave me to be a meal for the beasts, for it is they who can provide my way to God. Though if I suffer Jesus Christ will give me liberty and in him I shall rise again as a free man. For the present, these chains are schooling me to have done with earthly desires. In the first chapter of this letter of Ignatius to the Romans, he talks about the chains of Jesus. That gives him a little bit of a reach of authority. The deacons, too, who serve the mysteries of Jesus Christ must be men universally approved in every way, since they are not mere dispensers of meat and drink, but servants of the church of God, and therefore under obligation to guard themselves against any slur or imputation as strictly as they would against the fire itself. They each have a court, the emperor or the king has a court of officials with knights and that sort of thing that advise him and carry out his will. The Reformers, of course, sort of claim that what they were doing was simply getting back to the biblical model. It may have been written around the same time as the letters of Ignatius. Then he goes into fasting, here’s how you’re supposed to fast:Your fast must not be identical with those of the hypocrites. You have, first, prayers of thanksgiving, and it’s this word thanksgiving that we actually get the term “Eucharist,” and that just comes from the Greek word “thanksgiving.” Now about the apostles and prophets, act in line with the gospel precept. If he stays three days he is a false prophet. Unfortunately it doesn’t work in modern Christianity, so we have a lot of false prophets on TV asking for a lot of money."
958,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-26,"How did a small group following an apocalyptic prophet in Palestine become Christianity - what is now called a “world religion”? This small movement saw many changes in the second, third, and fourth centuries, from the development of different sects, philosophical theologies, and martyrology, to the rise of monasticism, and finally to the ascension of Constantine to the throne and the Christian Roman Empire. It was not until the nineteenth century, however, that the term “world religion” came to be used and Christianity was categorized as such.","We’re going to talk about the big question, how did this little group of Jews following a prophet, an apocalyptic prophet, around Galilee, who was then executed shortly thereafter in Jerusalem, become what we now call a major world religion. He probably would have rejected it because that would imply that he was doing something else besides just bringing the Gentiles into Israel. Either he may have thought he was the Messiah or some of his disciples may have hoped that he was the Messiah, but he didn’t go around preaching about himself. We’ve seen how the writer of 2 Peter will talk about Paul’s letters as scripture. Paul himself thought he was continuing Judaism. In the second century this separation of the church from the synagogue will start becoming clearer in certain places, and, finally, what you’ll end up with, after the fourth, fifth, and sixth century is a Christian church that’s not Jewish and Rabbinic Judaism that comes to look more like what Judaism has looked since that time, even different from the Judaism as it was in the time of Jesus. We don’t have the kind of demographic data to know how much numerical growth there was in the Christian church in the second century, but we can obviously tell it’s happening in different places by, if nothing more, an increase in written literature that comes about in different geographical locations during the second century. In the second century we do have some Jews who follow Jesus; they take Jesus to be the Messiah. Valentinus was a Christian scholar who lived in Rome in the middle of the second century, and he gathered around him other Christians, and they indulged in sort of a very philosophical way of thinking about Christianity and the Gospel. Marcion also then is being kicked out of the church in Rome and being declared a heretic in the second century, but he founds churches that exist then for a couple of centuries after his death, especially in the eastern part of the empire. You have a person who goes around in robes, he grows his beard long, he carries scrolls around so he can look like a philosopher. Clement writes against that kind of stuff. You have this idea I’ve talked about last time, that martyrs are especially close to God. Galen was the most famous medical writer of antiquity and tons and tons of his medical writings still survive, and it takes forever to read through them, even in an English translation much less in Greek and now in Arabic translation that survived. In the third century you have developments that are very important. Again, they were borrowing from Roman military imagery and military ideology. You’ve got all kinds of views about Jesus that would later be declared heretical. This is what starts changing in the fourth century. So you had this Constantinian dynasty that was able to bring a good bit of solidity to the Roman Empire in the fourth century that it hadn’t enjoyed in the third century. And that split of course is still with us. You really–the most honest question is to say, well it didn’t really happen until scholars invented it in the twentieth century because that’s when the very category of “world religion” came about for us to use. Obviously with Constantine you get the emperor promoting this religion now. So Ramsey McMullen, retired historian right here at Yale, has written famously about this that, apparently, in the second and third century Christians were just really damn good healers and exorcists, and that may be why they grew. It was the locals who felt like what they were doing was dangerous. They had a lot of reasons to try to suppress Christianity. It was originally simply the Bishop of Rome. The Bishop of Alexandria was important because Alexandria was important."
959,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-2,"The Christian faith is based upon a canon of texts considered to be holy scripture. How did this canon come to be? Different factors, such as competing schools of doctrine, growing consensus, and the invention of the codex, helped shape the canon of the New Testament. Reasons for inclusion in or exclusion from the canon included apostolic authority, general acceptance, and theological appropriateness for “proto-orthodox” Christianity.","These are not necessarily the same thing. And so it comes to be a list that accounts as authoritative in early Christianity. So when you see the term “scripture” in the New Testament, every time except, maybe, one time–and we’ll talk about this when we get to it–it refers to Jewish scripture that Christians accepted, followers of Jesus accepted, as their own. Remember, there’s no printing press in the ancient world. So some scholars have suggested that maybe the letter to the Ephesians was originally intended as a circular letter. So the manuscript tradition suggests that it was a letter that was a circular letter in itself. For example, I said, Colossians I don’t think is written by Paul, but by a disciple of Paul, maybe after his death. And he’s using another forged letter by Paul as his model. But he used the letter to the Colossians as one of his models. But Paul was not a disciple of Jesus during Jesus’ lifetime. Paul never saw Jesus, except in his visions. We think he’s, probably, talking about the gospels, but he doesn’t actually use that term as much as he talks about “the memoirs of the apostles.” There are several other gospels that are floating around the second century. Now, you may have noticed if you’ve actually read any of the letters of Paul, and the Gospel of Luke, that these people seem to believe that the creator God mentioned in Jewish scripture actually was the father of Jesus Christ. So Marcion claimed that he could edit out all the added stuff out of Paul’s letters and out of the Gospel of Luke. So how do you tell an orthodox Christian from a heretical Christian? Marcion, though, seemed to have spurred other Christian leaders to decide what they thought Christian scripture should do. You have four different gospels accepted by some people, five or six by other people. Why do you have four?So you have other people, like Tatian. And that John was written by the disciple John. So this was a list of books that some author believed were scripture and should be read by Christians and churches. And he mentions others that he believes they should not. This canon list includes these books that aren’t in our bible: The Wisdom of Solomon, which is actually in the apocrypha–and I’ll talk about that–and the Apocalypse of Peter. The Letter to the Hebrews, one letter of John, he rejects the Shepherd of Hermas, which is a book that we include in a groupings of writing we call the Apostolic Fathers. Now, what some scholars may have speculated–we don’t know this for sure. Because all of a sudden, cumbersome scrolls–what would be contained in the codices we have–the plural of this is, is either codexes sometimes, or if you want to act like you actually know Greek–I mean, Latin, you’d use the old Latinized plural, codices. But they would be big, but still that would be a lot easier to transport and handle than a whole box or closet full of scrolls. They also have a longer version of Daniel and a longer version of Esther. Well, at the time of the Reformation, Roman Catholics had not only the 27 books of the New Testament canon that we now have, and they had what Protestants came to accept as the Old Testament. So what the rabbis–now, this is all after Jesus and Paul. So they will call their bible Tanakh often, or just the bible. Protestants have followed the rabbis, in a sense, and accepted the Hebrew Bible as being the Old Testament. So, you know, Christians are always squabbling. So some councils did try to set the canon. Nor do we believe they were written even by the close disciples of apostles. Like I said, they wanted them to be traced back to the apostles."
960,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-3,"Knowledge of historical context is crucial to understanding the New Testament. Alexander the Great, in his conquests, spread Greek culture throughout the Mediterranean world. This would shape the structure of city-states, which would share characteristically Greek institutions, such as the  and the . This would also give rise to religious syncretism, that is, the mixing of different religions. The rise of the Romans would continue this trend of universalization of Greek ideals and religious tolerance, as well as implement the social structure of the Roman household. The , and the vast infrastructures of the Roman Empire, would facilitate the rapid spread of Christianity.","Religion can’t be divorced from social, political, and historical contexts and issues. Now these are going to be sort of dreary, boring, typical Martin lectures; dreary and boring historical surveys. He died in 323, when he was not yet 33-years-old, and he died in Babylon of a fever, that is, of course, modern day Iraq. But if you were going to be elite–he wanted to establish cities throughout his empire that would be actually Greek cities, and he wanted to have the elite people all be able, at least, to speak Greek. And they all would speak what developed to be a common form of Greek, slightly different from Classical Greek, and we call that Koine Greek; and is just a Greek word that means common, or shared. is the Greek word that means the formation of the young man. So the were those boys who were between the age of maybe 16 or 17 and 20 or 22. You would march together in a parade in town. So democracies of some sort existed in different places. So people have all kinds of entertainments in the theater. So the was the city place, and it would often meet in a theater. The other thing you have is religious syncretism. The Greek word means “a mixing together.” This is not a Greek tradition, but it’s very much a tradition in the East for kings to be considered by their people to be gods. And this is part of what ancient religion was like, is that people were not exclusive. Gods knew that everybody was–they weren’t particularly jealous, in that sense. So Romans didn’t go around trying to get people in the East to speak Latin. Greek language, culture, and religions, different religions and the syncretism, Greek education, the structure–all of these things remained in the East throughout the Roman rule of the East, all the way up until the time you had a Christian emperor with Constantine, and later. It actually was originally used for the slaves of a household. The Roman household was constructed like a pyramid. The wife though is legally a part of her own household over here. He couldn’t legally own the money; his master legally owned everything the slave owned. But, practically, and in some legal contexts, what they would do is they’d allow the slave the use of that money, and that’s called the .Now when this slave is freed, by the owner, the slave could take the with him, and then he could set up his own business, but he’d still be a client of the owner, because he’s still officially part of his household. Legally, that’s correct, but you see cases in letters and all kinds of stuff from the Ancient World that women actually were more unofficially part of their husband’s house. But this was a legal situation to try to keep this balance of power among households. This will be very important because Christians started out as house churches, and their house churches fit sometimes the model of a Greek, an assembly, but sometimes the model of the Roman household. He eased some of the strains on the poor. This is why the word “tax collector” is such a bad word, for everybody but the Romans; why you’ll see in the gospels the term “tax collectors and sinners.” Because the Jews didn’t like the tax collectors because they were being ripped off by them. They built roads for the army, but of course other people used the roads too. As far as religion–Ehrman talks about this in your textbook, so I won’t go into a lot of detail–but the common Hollywood idea that the Romans were kind of oppressive of other religions, or the Christians, is just that, a Hollywood idea."
961,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-4,"Of the four kingdoms that arose after Alexander’s death, those of the Seleucids and the Ptolemies are most pertinent to an understanding of the New Testament. Especially important is the rule of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who forced the issue of Hellenism in Jerusalem by profaning the temple. Jews were not alike in their reaction to Hellenization, but a revolt arose under the leadership of the Mattathias and his sons, who would rule in the Hasmonean Dynasty. After the spread of Roman rule, the Judea was under client kings and procurators until the Jewish War and the destruction of the temple in 70 CE. Revolt was only one Jewish response to foreign rule; another was apocalypticism, as we see in Daniel and also in the Jesus’ teaching and the early Christian movement.","The chronological end of the Old Testament, Hebrew Bible, takes place in the sixth century BCE that is in the 500s BCE. So they would themselves get this sort of Greek rhetorical education. Why did he build a gymnasium in Jerusalem? This would have consolidated the power of those Jewish leaders who wanted to press Greek culture more rather than those Jewish leaders who wanted to hold back on Greek culture. The high priesthood was the main ruler of the Jews at this time. They could also have been thinking about the Syrian god Baal, that Baal Shamin was a Syrian god, so they’re just saying we’ll have an altar here, Antiochus will be happy because we’re worshipping this Syrian god here, the Greeks are happy we’re worshipping Zeus Olympus, and the Jews will be happy because it’s identified as Yahweh. There were several responses to Hellenization, therefore, among Jews. They seemed to promote the speaking of Hebrew, the use of Hebrew text, and particularly pious observations of Jewish law. Something like this may have been going on. Mattathias, it is said, took the sword away from the soldier and killed this priest and the soldier for encouraging Jews in his village to sacrifice to the gods. Their family name was not Maccabeus, that was just a nickname, the family name was Hasmoneus and so we call this the Hasmonean Dynasty, that’s the descendants of Mattathias. Here again it’s sort of like the fourth–Chapter 11:2, “The four shall be far richer then all of them when he has become strong to his riches, he shall stir up all against the Kingdom of Greece,” so this is actually talking about the Persian ruler who will attack Greece. “ Now go over to 11:29 because I’m not going to lead you through all the stuff that happens in Chapter 11 because if you read it, and you read it with the footnotes, it’s basically telling you a history of the battles and alliances between the Seleucids and the Ptolemies and where Judea was caught in the middle at different times. “ Antiochus IV will pay attention to the Jews who have forsaken the Torah, “Forces sent by him shall occupy and profane the temple and the fortress. He knows when the Romans intervened and stopped battles between them. This is how we date apocalyptic literature. Daniel is one of the earliest cases of what we call apocalyptic literature. And soangelic armies will break into history and bring about the solution to the problem. That’s when it’s dated because they’re writing up to that point. A hundred years after the cleansing of the temple, , in the year 63 BCE, Pompey, the Roman general Pompey, enters Jerusalem, and this is when you have the beginning of Roman control of Judea. That is rabbinic Judaism as it comes to be important. Hellenization was extremely important because it united the Mediterranean world, the eastern Mediterranean but then the Romans even took over some of the aspects of Hellenization when they took over all of the Mediterranean. The Psalms are full of language that implied that whoever is in control in Jerusalem is the king of world, and yet the Jews looked around themselves and they’re going, we haven’t had anybody who approached that in centuries. On Monday you’ll be asked to come in with lists of historical events as you see them in Acts and lists of historical events as you see them in Galatians 1 and 2."
962,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-5,"The accounts of Paul’s travels in The Acts of the Apostles and Galatians seem to contradict each other at many points. Their descriptions of a meeting in Jerusalem–a major council in Acts versus a small, informal gathering in Galatians–also differ quite a bit. How do we understand these differences? A historical critical reading of these accounts does not force these texts into a harmonious unity or accept them at face value. Instead, a historical critical reading carefully sifts through the details of the texts and asks which of these is more likely to be historically accurate.","All right, I ask you to come in with definite lists of where Paul was when, according to two different sources. In 7:58, so we actually see him before then. Now let’s just read that first part there, “They dragged him out of the city,” that is Stephen, “Began to stone him, the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul,” who the writer of Acts will later tell us is also named Paul, so Saul is–Acts depicts Saul as his Jewish name and Paul as sort of his Greek and Roman name. “ So he went in and out among them in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. He spoke and argued with the Hellenists ; but they were attempting to kill him. You don’t have to know the year but how much time are we talking about between this Damascus period and this time Barnabas introduces him to the rest of the church and gets him accepted by the church."
963,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-6,"The Gospels of the New Testament are not biographies, and, in this class, they are read through a historical critical lens. This means that the events they narrate are not taken at face value as historical. The Gospel of Mark illustrates how the gospel writer skillfully crafts a narrative in order to deliver a message. It is a message that emphasizes a suffering messiah, and the necessity of suffering before glory. The gospel’s apocalyptic passages predict troubles for the Jewish temple and incorporate this prediction with its understanding of the future coming of the Son of Man.","What is a Gospel and how should we read it? We don’t know about his relationship to his parents, his brothers and sisters, we don’t know all kinds of things that a modern biography would automatically be expected to tell you. Then Chapters 11 through 15 are all just the last week in Jerusalem, again, five chapters just on his last week. But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you.” Obviously ancient people had the same sense of uneasiness with the way–with Mark ending at 16:8 and what you’ve got in that shorter ending and the longer ending were later compositions of scribes, Christian scribes, who thought you can’t end Mark’s Gospel that way, so they made up those other verses and they put them at the end of the manuscript they were copying. At least we take the Gospel of Mark as ending at 16:8, even intentionally. For personal guidance, for doctrine, for images of Jesus, to help their relationship to God, whatever. The historian is what I’m playing my role here in this class. There are also literary ways of reading these texts and this has been a very common thing in English departments for people to write an account of the Gospel of Mark, it’s been a particularly significant Gospel for modern literary people to retell or talk about the Gospel of Mark, do a literary reading of it. There they’re looking for things like the plot of it, the way it accomplishes its story. There have been a lot of other theories about this Messianic secret. When Jesus heard this he said to them, “Those who are well …”Is that what I want to read? The point I’m making is that people tend to misunderstand Jesus, his sayings, and often events. “ Well he’s not calling for Elijah; it’s just that the word–the Aramaic word ,  sounds like the name Elijah, so people standing around misunderstand things that are happening. In other words, Jesus had multiplied loaves and fishes in a previous scene. The first person who recognizes Jesus in the Gospel of Mark is you, because the very first verse announces, “The beginning of the good news,” in Greek, meaning “good announcement, good news” of Jesus Christ the Son of God. Jesus is not a very good evangelist, apparently. Now wait a minute that might be important. Peter says, You’re the Messiah, you’re not going to be killed and suffer, and that’s when Jesus turns around and rebukes Peter looking at His disciples–is that an interesting clue? You have the charge to secrecy in 8:30; you have the passion prediction–one of the passion predictions and the first of several that we’ll see in Mark. Not that the Messiah would suffer but that the Jews themselves might have to suffer before the fabulous kingdom of the end time. Remember you saw it in Daniel, when we read Daniel two classes ago, Daniel predicts suffering for the righteous, and only after the suffering would you have the goodies, heaven, the Kingdom of God. Even though you have worse things happening, 13:12:Brother will betray brother to death, a father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; and you will be hated by all because of my name, but the one who endures to the end will be saved. Then 13:14, “But when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be,” now here’s one of those little phrases, “Let the reader understand.” Then you will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great glory and power. Then he will send out the angels, and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven. Conservative Christians know that more than one generation has happened since that time; many, many, many generations. It seems to me that what Mark’s intention is to put some kind of time limit on this. I believe that the Gospel of Mark may have been written right before 70 or right around 70, but the destruction of the temple has not sunk into consciousness yet or is not known to happen."
964,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-7,"The Gospel of Matthew contains some of the most famous passages that both Christians and non-Christians are familiar with. However, Matthew also presents itself paradoxically as preaching a Torah observant Christianity and a Christian mission that seeks to reach gentiles. The figure of Jesus in Matthew is that of a teacher, the founder of the Church, and the model for the apostles and Matthew’s own community. Matthew seems to be writing for a church community that needs encouragement to have faith in a time of trouble.","The Gospel of Matthew, from the second century on, has been pretty much the most popular famous of the Gospels, that’s probably why it’s first in our Bible, simply because it was the most populous. Herod gets all worried because he doesn’t want to  his own throne. The whole thing about that, the Egyptian sojourn, the holy family goes to Egypt to escape the wicked king. Turn the other cheek, that’s also in Luke 6:29, but most people know it from Matthew 5:39.In Matthew, the Pharisees are called, over and over again, hypocrites, and in fact if you look up the word “Pharisee” in a dictionary, an English dictionary, “hypocrite” will be one of the definitions you’ll find for it. refers to the teachings that are about how you should live. Notice it’s from–as I said it’s from Matthew that you get the idea that Pharisees are all hypocrites, and then that gets transferred to being that all Jews are hypocrites. Remember it’s in the Gospel of Matthew that you get the most anti-Jewish and anti-Semitic line that’s been used throughout Western history, when the Jew–when Pilate wants to release Jesus from being crucified the people, the Jews say, “His blood be upon us and our children.” Some people have even suggested that Matthew is intentionally structuring his Gospel to make it look like the Torah, the Jewish law. There are five speeches by Jesus in Matthew. Matthew takes over that speech from Mark, where he finds it, he adds a lot of materials on his own, he also brings it up to date, because remember I talked about last time, Mark didn’t explicitly tell us about the destruction of Jerusalem in his Gospel. I have come not to abolish but to fulfill. For I tell you unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Remember when I talked about Mark, he gives you little clues that you’re really supposed to pay attention. Matthew has Jesus disagree with the scribes and Pharisees, but what he says here is that it’s much more important–sure, keeping kosher may be important but it’s much more important what’s going on in your heart and your mind, it’s much more important what you say. Jesus didn’t go around in his own life talking about the church, the church developed after His death; Matthew retrojects the conversation about the church, and even the foundation of the church, and sort of laws about the church into the mouth of Jesus. Mark had told us in his Gospel that Jesus was a great teacher, and people said, Wow, he’s a great teacher, He teaches not like the scribes and the Pharisees. He writes his Gospel to help people figure out how to imitate Jesus in being a good scribe. How do discern what of the old you should use and what of the new you should use. Notice again Jesus withdraws in the face of danger but the withdrawing in a sense increases the ministry in an odd paradoxical way. Redaction is just a fancy word for editing. It just means paying attention to how the Gospel writers edited their sources to get out their own message. But that’s Matthew telling his church I know you’re not perfect now, but God–Jesus calls you to perfection. An exegesis wouldn’t ask you to do all of those things together. It’s not to say whether it’s true or not. Well, okay yeah maybe so, but dig deeper. Even if Gentiles come in, which the Gentiles do come in, Gentiles must be expected to keep the law also. Most of the scholars date it to somewhere in the 80s, maybe not earlier then the year 80, maybe not later than the year 90, we’re guessing on this, but it seems to be–it has to be after 70, but he’s in conflict with whoever is–there are still Pharisees around, there are still scribes, there are other who are offering a slightly different version of what it means to be Jewish, and that’s the last thing that I’ll say about this, is that Matthew is not presenting a new religion. In fact, scholars nowadays say, Matthew does not represent a new religion with his Gospel; he actually represents a different Jewish sect. Does Matthew believe Gentiles should be circumcised?"
965,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-8,"We have known of the existence of the Gospel of Thomas from ancient writers, but it was only after the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Codices that the actual text became available. The Gospel of Thomas is basically a collection of sayings, or logia, that sometimes seem similar, perhaps more primitive than sayings found in the canonical Gospels. Sometimes, however, the sayings seem better explained as reflecting a “Gnostic” understanding of the world. This involves a rejection of the material world and a desire for , a secret knowledge, in order to escape the world and return to the divine being.","One of the themes of the course, maybe the main theme of the course is the diversities of early Christianity. There are all kinds of Thomas literature from the ancient world. When one kind of writer is condemning another bunch of people you can’t necessarily trust what they say. Some of them, for example, are just pieces of Plato, or parts of the Bible, and that sort of thing. Others fell upon the thorns, and they choked the seed; and the grubs devoured them. Rather, the kingdom of the Father is spread out over the earth and people do not see it. But as for me I am amazed at how this great wealth has come to dwell in this poverty. He said to them, “Whoever has ears should listen! It’s an abstract word meaning “full” or “fullness,” but it comes to be some kind of technical term that refers to, all of existence, or the fullness of being or think of German philosophy with fullness with–Being with a capital “B” or Existence with a capital “E.” So that word often occurs here, and when you see the word “entirety” in Layton’s translation he’s translated that word . Several other places, saying 77 has another reference to that. Notice we’ve already seen that this text does not take the kingdom of God as something existing in the future. Remember we encountered this word in a previous lecture which just means something having to do with the end,  in Greek meaning the end. Like a stranger you have gotten up on my couch and you have eaten from my table.” Look at 97, now you see aren’t you glad that I didn’t make you do an exegesis paper of these sayings?Jesus said, “What the kingdom of the father resembles is a woman who is conveying a jar full of meal. Then you’ll also have, even if you took very reputable scholars, you will have wide differences of opinion, and one of the big differences of opinion right now–when the Gospel of Thomas first became published people sort of talked about it as though this is a Gnostic gospel. Other people have said, no, it’s not Gnostic, it doesn’t have all the main things that we look for; in fact, they’ve even said we shouldn’t even use this term Gnosticism anymore because it doesn’t refer to anything we can actually locate in the ancient world. The word “orthodox” of course just means “right thinking,” “right opinion.” Ancient Gnosticism, if you want to call it that, does not seem to have been one church. It seems like the people who wrote these documents and collected these materials that we find in the Nag Hammadi text in the Gospel of Thomas, they seem to have been intellectuals who were impressed with Jesus, impressed with the Jewish scripture in a lot of cases, impressed with a lot of the teachings of Christianity, but they interpreted them through the eyes of a certain popular Platonism at the time. Salvation will come by knowledge and that knowledge is a secret, not everybody knows it, so only a few people know it. That’s what Jesus did: Jesus was a redeemer from the supreme God who comes in to find those people who have a spark of the divine in them, to blow on that spark, to get it going, and to get you to remember where you came from. The true message of Christianity, according to these guys, is to learn who you are, where you came from, to see if you’re going to escape the body and get back to your true origin, that is, you will become one with God again. Mud, entrapped in a dead body, trapped in materiality. Sex, therefore, sensual desire, erotic desire is a bad thing; it’s an evil thing because that–you’re just trying to trap more sparks into more mud bodies. Look at 24:His disciples said, “Show us the place where you are, for we must seek it.” If it does not enlighten, that person is darkness. Look at 56:Jesus said, “Whoever has become acquainted with the world has found a corpse, and the world is not worthy of the one who has found the corpse."
966,religious-studies,rlst-152,lecture-9,"Luke and Acts, a two-volume work, are structured very carefully by the author to outline the ministry of Jesus and the spread of the Gospel to the gentiles. The Gospel of Luke emphasizes the themes of Jesus’ Jewish piety, his role as a rejected prophet, and the reversal of earthly status. The Gospel ends in Jerusalem, and the Acts of the Apostles begins there and then follows the spread of the Gospel, both conceptually and geographically, to Samaria and the gentiles. By closely analyzing the Gospel and Acts, we see that the author was not concerned with historicity or chronological order. Rather, he writes his “orderly account” to illustrate the rejection of the Gospel by the Jews and its consequent spread to the gentiles.","Turn to the beginning of the Gospel of Luke. There are several things that this prologue to the Gospel of Luke tells us. Now already, when you’ve been working on the synoptic problem and how to write an exegesis paper, you have figured out that the Gospel writers used other sources. This guy actually admits it up front, so it sounds like he’s using both written sources and oral sources. Those are several things about that we need to notice. All of this starts off partly in Galilee but also partly in Judea. Now that’s different from Matthew, Matthew just started off with the holy family living in Bethlehem. Then you have 4:31 to 8:56, the Galilean ministry proper. That is, this is Jesus going around Galilee, healing people, preaching, teaching. This is a very big verse in Luke although–but you’d never know it unless you had a scholar kind of point it out to you; 9:51: “When the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem.” That introduces, then, this period of the Gentiles. Then after completing their mission, Barnabus and Saul returned to Jerusalem and brought with them John, whose other name was Mark. What does he add to the scene he gets from Mark? He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.” They got up, drove him out of town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built so that they might hurl him off the cliff. Again, Jesus in his first sermon quotes this “acceptable year of the Lord” as being his year; it’s the Jesus year in Judea. First Jesus sets himself up as a prophet, right, by quoting–by citing stories about Elijah, who helped the woman–the widow’s son, and Elisha, so Elijah and Elisha are important prophets for Luke and Jesus portrays as being like that, so that’s why he says:No prophet is accepted in the prophet’s hometown. So another theme of Luke and Acts is true prophets get rejected by their own people. No, he’s even–you can tell he’s even getting it out of his source from one spot and consciously transferring it to another spot, which tells us one thing, is that to him it’s not that important chronologically when this story actually happened. Now those who were scattered, because of the persecution that took place over Stephen, traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, and they spoke the word to no one except Jews. Luke takes a little paragraph in which he shifts your focus here from the whole Jerusalem, Judea, Jewish oriented form of the movement, and now he goes to Antioch and now you get this Greek kind of movement, it’s predominantly in a Greek speaking city, Antioch. Stephen, is that a good Hebrew or Aramaic name? Devout men buried Stephen and made loud lamentation over him. First he wants to say, well Phillip went to Samaria and he preached to Samaria, so you have Samaria there. Luke wants Peter to be the first person to take the message to Gentiles, and he wants Peter to do so only after being compelled by God to do so. In other words, what you get there is a key to what is the entire outline of Acts. Rome sort of representing symbolically the very ultimate ends of the earth. He puts it in an order–even in the order he puts it, even the outline on his books because he wants to have this message of the Gospel centering on Jerusalem, that’s why the whole first part of Luke centers in–that’s why he has ten full chapters on the journey to Jerusalem."
967,sociology,socy-151,lecture-10,"We review Marx’s theory of alienation and pick up with the transition from the young Marx to the mature Marx who breaks with Hegelian thought and the Young Hegelians. Reflecting on the disappointed hopes of the French Revolution, Hegel wrote that the civil servants in France represent the universal class. In direct contrast, Marx writes that the state only appears to be the universal class. He then goes about writing his theory of exploitation to argue that the workers, as the only fully alienated class, represent the universal position. He responds to Feuerbach with his eleven theses arguing for his own brand of historical materialism. Many of his “Theses on Feuerbach” remain very famous and widely-associated with Marx’s oeuvre, including the last thesis, thesis eleven: the point of philosophy is not only to understand the world, but to change it.","In the discussion section I realized I sort of screwed my last lecture. In fact, the first Marx–the humanist, the Hegelian, the idealist–was almost forgotten for a very long time, and was rediscovered by the 1960s onwards, generally. Smart people read the theory of alienation in Marx earlier; Georg Lukács, for instance. There is no cultural theory without the theory of alienation. This is not a religious, not a theological proposition. So Hegel’s fundamental idea is that when you have the absolute spirit–right?–and this is not a personal God but just the idea. And you are the subject who are reflecting on it. But because you are gaining some consciousness, you are beginning to conquer the objective conditions of your life. It was united with the objective conditions. There was no subject separated from the object. You are free, but within your freedom you are alienated because you don’t control your conditions, and it looks like that within your freedom, within your free choice, you are forced to do stuff. To put it with John Stuart Mill, you don’t feel self-development. To put it in the terminology we used in this course before, there must be something like common good, which brings capital and labor together. And we also occasionally think about it this way. If you are rich, you have more influence on what the government does, rather when you are poor. And then they accepted it, they do something for the owner of that private jet. So that’s when he writes , and tries to now bring the whole idea of alienation down to earth, to fill it with some economic content. This is the young or mature Marx, and we will talk about him very briefly. It’s more poetry than–it is certainly not social science. Well it’s not enough to be critical in thought. But really, the message of alienation is much broader. And he will argue that this has to–he historically specified material force. And these are the eleven pieces–very short. But it is assumed that there are objective conditions irrespective from the subject, and you only reflect on the subjective conditions. Now I will look at the collective, social relations–relational, what I’m suggesting is relational. And he knew that, you know, the prison guards will read it. And those of you in my discussion section yesterday, this is what you did: you educated the educator."
968,sociology,socy-151,lecture-11,"Today we cover the transition from the young Marx, with his emphasis on change and action, to the mature Marx who turns toward positivist science and determinism, arguing that capitalism will have to fail. Through a closer look at Marx’s “Theses on Feuerbach,” we discuss different theories of truth with attention to the questions of where truth resides (in the subject, in the object, or some combination), how we know it, and how we know when we know it. Arguing for his conception of materialism, Marx argues that truth is not simply the reflection of the object in the mind of the subject; we must access truth through our senses and through activity. And we discuss two of Marx’s historical materialist claims: life determines consciousness and the ruling class always determines the ruling ideas of a people.","So today we will be talking about , and Marx becoming a historical materialist. And there’s a lot of truth to it, but half-truths, and he is struggling in “The Theses on Feuerbach”–as I said, he’s on his way from naturalism to materialism, and the central idea is, as I said, praxis, human practices. When I don’t know what something, then I say it is dialectical.” And because Marx was moving into, today we will call it normal science, he becomes a real scientist. Very widely shared today, and probably a theory of truth what many of you in this room share. Right?So he creates peace between Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx. than, you know, being in McDonald’s and serving hamburgers. I think reification is a very good translation. Only those of us who speak English but do not speak Latin don’t necessarily quite get it. We do not see ourselves as the masters of the world, but we see ourselves as ruled by the world. And the essence is the philosophy of praxis of the young Marx, ending–right?–with “The Theses on Feuerbach”, the point is to change it; the point is to change the world. You are an economist, you describe the objective facts. That we’re beginning to think about social life as if it were natural, as if it would have the power of nature; the economic laws look like lightening. You can’t do virtually nothing about an earthquake. But even we cannot really predict earthquakes. So it’s an interesting interaction between yes, I mean we can’t do anything–right?–because we were born into conditions, but within some limits we can change those conditions. So let me come back to this subject and object issue. It is in the force-field of subject and object. The real purpose of cognition is not simply to describe the world but to change it–right?–to make it a better world. You know, after all this guy is a theorist of the revolution. If he would have believed ideas do not matter, he would not have spent, you know, all of his time, eight in the morning, nine– until nine p.m. in the British library, and writing books. ”And then he’s beginning to develop the theory of modes of production. And then he tries to come up with subsequent modes of production. So tell me what your class position is and I will tell you how you will vote in the next elections."
969,sociology,socy-151,lecture-12,"We consider closely Marx’s , written between  and . In the , Marx revisits and revises his theory of historical change. Previously, he argued that history is characterized by a uni-linear increase in the division of labor. He also argued that class struggle caused revolutionary transitions from one mode of production to the next–slavery to feudalism to capitalism–and that Communism will be the last stage in social evolution. In the , Marx develops a theory of historical change focused on property relations. In addition, he depicts a more complex, multi-linear development of history. The facet of Marx which he exhibits in the  tends not to be the one that is widely remembered, but understanding the nuances he presents there is crucial to fully understand his idea of history and historical change and the role of property in capitalism and Communism.","Marx is cited that once he said, “I am not a Marxist.” And in some ways he remains a positivist social scientist, in his major works. And easy to be less doctrinaire–right?–if you are one of the persons who created the doctrine. And this is also contradictory, full with tensions and contradictions. But it is a formidable body of propositions; absolutely formidable. A theory, when you have an idea what are really the causal mechanisms, what links cause to an effect. We will see when we will be discussing Weber, whom I admire a great deal, that Weber really does not have such a theory. And I think this is a very powerful argument, what he makes it here. And I pointed to this in the earlier lecture. And this is what will come back in later Marx, and that dominate Marxists of various kinds. And as I said, he will show the causal mechanism how it is happening. This is a messy description of human history, a multi-linear trajectory; and I will show you what his multi-linear trajectory is. I think I also mentioned once that Marx, in a letter to Engels, once wrote: “You know, when I don’t understand something, then I say it is dialectical.” There is the tribal society–very primitive means of production: hunting, fishing, gathering. They do not have a title of the land and the home, but they have possession of the land and the home. But then he looks at–you know, compares–the Dark Middle Ages in Europe–right?–the peaks of feudalism with Rome and Greece and Athens. And you will put your skills to use, and therefore you will be able to use very–with great care, that the computers you use are not being damaged, as you are using them. At one point capitalism, like any other previous modes of production, will get in conflict with its relations of production, and that’s when the revolution will have to come. This is an idea which then comes back and haunts us all the time. That is what capitalism is producing, in contrast to traditional or feudal society. So you are also freed from your possessions. Okay, just very briefly about the evolution of the modes of production and changing property relations. There is no separation really of the objective conditions and the laborer.” They actually do not have ownership, but have possession of the means of production. They are not treated as legally free individuals and subjects. He spent, you know, from eight in the morning until ten in the evening, was sitting in the British library and reading like crazy."

Marx argues that what sets the capitalist mode of production apart from the commodity mode of production is not only the accumulation of money; the capitalist mode of production is characterized by the use of labor power as a commodity to create more value. The capitalist compensates the laborer enough for his labor power to reproduce the commodity (the labor power), but the laborers’ power produces additional value: a surplus value for the owner. The worker is exploited when he does not keep or control the value created by his own labor power. Marx argues that the capitalist system forces people into one of two classes: the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. This class dichotomy did not describe accurately social structure in Marx time, when a sizable class of self-employed existed. Marx predicted that this “middle class” will disappear; instead it grew in size over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.","And after a long detour we are finally at the Marx you are probably the most familiar with, or the kind of Marx you have heard the most about. And this is now his major contribution, the theory of exploitation. Whether it is right or wrong, this is another question. And it’s also something which has very much entered the public discourse. But it has very important theoretical insights. So it leaves to you–right?–and the next text– test in this course, to figure out what the right theory of classes are, and what’s wrong about it. Even in the United States the notion is around us; though there is no other modern society which is so free from the idea of class and exploitation as the US of A. But even in the US of A, we still talk at least about the middle class. Let me just remind you what the step backward. It is not enough for you, in order to be and stay in business, if all what you collect a return of the capital you advanced for the production, and the wages what you paid to your laborers to complete the process. So there is, one argument is, all capital was at one point a product of labor, and that is what is your investment. Marx seemed to have a more complex notion. And he was puzzled by this because the overwhelming majority of Americans were actually involved in self-employment. There is nothing alienating about this process. Now let me just say a few more words about this. Why does a capitalist need more money than it started the process? If there would be a capitalist who would buy cheap and sell dear, and would pocket a profit this way, there will be others who will say, ‘Well I will compete and I will sell it less expensively, and I will sell more, and I will create more profit, and we’ll push these artificially high prices down. Well, and this is also important, that Marx suggests therefore what the laborer has to sell cannot be labor, it must be labor power. And let me just emphasize, it’s very, very important for these chapters what you have read. That those are always equivalents which have to exchange each other at the marketplace. If labor power is a commodity, the price of the labor power is exactly how much is necessary to reproduce that labor power. And this is why I said though there is a heavy–of course he hates capitalism, of course he hates exploitation. If exploitation is unique for a capitalist mode of production, reasonably you can talk only about classes in a capitalist mode of production where the labor power is free in the dual sense of the term–legally free and freed from the means of production and therefore has to sell its labor power. Then most importantly–right?–the bourgeoisie, he said, is a new class, and probably, arguably, the first real class. One, that actually this trend turned around. I even take my shoes to a shoemaker to fix them."
971,sociology,socy-151,lecture-14,"Today we take a bridge into the twentieth century, constructed by Nietzsche, Freud, and Weber’s critical theory. Each author is different in important ways, but they also agree on two crucial points: we must subject our consciousness and assumptions to critical scrutiny and, along with increasing liberation and rationalization in some ways, modern society also has repressive elements. Nietzsche is the oldest of these thinkers; he dies in 1900 and stops working a decade before due to mental illness. While he was ill, his sister, a proto-Nazi and associate of Hitler, cared for him. Her control of his papers and how they were released to the public painted him as a proto-Nazi himself, but reading his whole oeuvre illuminates that Nietzsche subjected Judaism and Christianity to the same scrutiny. In , Nietzsche attempts to use the genealogy method to be critical of modern morality without taking a certain vantage point. We discuss most specifically his genealogy of the ideas of good and bad and of good and evil.","Okay, now today we move–basically we move into the twentieth century. If I can put it very simply, the major departure is that they all depart from Marx’s economic reductionism–right?–the emphasis on economic interest, which is actually not only Marx. The problem of modernity is repression, in one way or another. But there is a point at which there is a continuity between them and Marx–Nietzsche, Freud and too mainly Weber; I mean, Weber is a somewhat more complicated story. For Freud it is our sexual experiences–right?-and he offers a criticism of our consciousness by confronting us with our repressed sexual experiences in our earlier life. Well Weber is more complicated, and we will come back to this, Weber’s critical theory, when we get to Weber, and to the question whether he’s a critical theorist at all, that has been highly debated. And he’s bringing up, in a very religious sentiments, very religious family. The story of his beginning of his mental illness tells you a lot about him. He is in Genoa, in Italy, and then he walks on the streets, and then he sees a carriage driver beating a horse vengefully. It I think tells a lot about who Nietzsche as a human being was–right?–and how actually–how much compassion he could have with suffering. This work, what you were reading, has a lot to do with suffering, and gives you a devastating view what human suffering means. He was very attracted to this idea of the superior Aryan race, and he actually created an Aryan colony in Paraguay, and moved with Elisabeth to Paraguay in a pure German community. They look like Indians, because of course not very pure Aryan nation; they are not blonde and blue eyes any longer. And some, therefore, had been reading for a very long time Nietzsche as an ideologue of Nazism. A beautiful young man, powerful, and heroic, like the gods, the Greek gods; that’s what he really admired. And what he found is something new in Wagner. It is an idea of a Buddha, but not a passive Buddha. That you compare two ways how morality has been constructed, and you are criticizing one from the point of view of the other, without taking sides where do actually you stand, as such. So this way what Nietzsche can do, or he believes he can do, is to offer a critical analysis, without some ultimate value. And the slave revolt of moralities, he said, begins with the Jewish revolt. And this has a thousand years of history. And here it comes: “The workshop ideals- where the ideals are fabricated.” But then came again, he said, “the Judeo triumphed again.”"
972,sociology,socy-151,lecture-15,"Freud’s brand of critical theory adds important dimensions; he argues that we can better understand our consciousness through the process of psychoanalysis–the talking cure, dream work, etc–and we can cure ourselves through this process as well. We discuss Freud’s early days in Vienna developing psychoanalysis as a clinical approach alongside Jung, Ferenczi, and others in their tight-knit circle. They develop the ideas of the id, ego, and superego as well as the antithetical drives, the love drive (Eros) and the death drive (Thanatos). Later, Freud applies these concepts to society as a whole in his books , and . His argument in  calls to mind Nietzsche; he argues that the repression of urges and drives allows civilization to bloom and flourish, but the same repression is problematic on the level of individual psychology as well as on the level of civilization.","I have to get started because there is, of course, a lot to be said about Sigmund Freud. So if you check your email, you have the questions for next Thursday. Those questions are not necessarily very easy. And it should be clear from the writings and from the lecture, and I think from the discussion sections–right?–that what he’s suggesting, that in the genealogical method you will take an ideal and a moral principle, what you think is the right idea, and then he will show that one can think about this idea differently; and historically they did think differently. You think an idea of what good is; it’s uncontestable, easy to agree? This is a radicalization of critical theory. Critical theory–we talked about this, from Hegel to Marx–was a critique of consciousness; that what is in our mind is a distortion of the reality. He was born in 1856, in what is now the Czech Republic, Moravia, southern part of the Czech Republic, in a small city called Freiberg. In 1873 he enrolled at the University of Vienna. This is something what you occasionally do, or your friends do with you. And when, through these free associations, he was digging into the unconscious, he began to discover a lot of sexual stuff. But there are still many, many people who do believe in Freud. Interestingly, I think somehow this is a little going out of fashion. And the Oedipus complex also means that we have a desire to kill our father in order to have the love–in fact, sexual love–of our mother, if we are boys, and vice-versa for girls. And he explains in this book the origins of first complex society as the brothers come together and they kill their father. Well there are, he said–here is beginning to move. Well he said, “The ego is very sharply separated from the id. It’s really the id is below the ego.” And that’s a very–this is probably the best to grasp, what he said: “The ego’s relationship to the id is like a man on a horseback”–right?–“after the rider is obliged to guide the horse where the horse wants to go.” In fact, I don’t think it is totally obvious how you have to interpret it, especially the first part. And he said this is exactly the young infant’s reaction how to respond to danger, and the reality, to hope that you will get protections from your father. And, of course, very much to Nietzsche–right?–that the problem is in human relations. This is sort of civilization is a technology, how to be able to control more people; control nature and more people. And in particular civilization restricts sexual life. It’s again almost–you read almost Nietzsche–right?–here. Only sexual relationship, on the basis of solitary, indissoluble bond between one man and one woman is what is accepted in Western civilization, not in other civilization."
973,sociology,socy-151,lecture-16,"Max Weber wrote his best-known work after he recovered from a period of serious mental illness near the turn of the twentieth century. After he recovered, his work transitioned from enthusiastically capitalist and liberal in the tradition of Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill to much more skeptical of the down-sides of modernization, more similar to the thinking of Nietzsche and Freud. In his first major work, , Weber argues that the Protestant faith, especially Luther’s notion of “calling” and the Calvinist belief in predestination set the stage for the emergence of the capitalist spirit. With his more complex understanding of the causes of capitalism, Weber accounts for the motivations of capitalists and the spirit of capitalism and rationalization in ways that Marx does not.","Now also I would like to spend a couple of minutes kind of wrapping up some issues about the four authors, what we covered in the test–right?–Marx, Nietzsche, Freud and Weber, just to help you to get an overall sense–right?–what the bottom line is, and what the similarities and differences are. That means they all offer critical analysis of what is in your mind. And the fundamental idea is that we actually do internalize the very principles of our submission. He was a younger brother of Max, and he was a very prominent economist, philosopher and sociologist, but primarily economist, who was well known for the theory of industrial location, in his times. He was a conservative politician, a very patriarchal figure. He started in the municipality as a civil servant in Erfurt. He also became professor of political science. He was involved early in his life in very feverish academic activities. Just during the summer of ‘97, the mother visited–he visited the parents in Berlin, and then the mother said, “Well I want to visit you in Heidelberg.” Well, no one knows exactly what it had to do with the death of the father, but there is certainly a correlation between the two facts. For five years Weber could not teach, could not write, could not read. He went to the St. Louis World Fair and wrote a wonderful paper at that time. Then he has his nervous breakdown, and the person who is emerging looks like a person who has been thinking about Nietzsche–right?–by staring ahead of himself a great deal, and that’s beginning to show already in .Well he was working at a time when Marxism was the dominant intellectual force in Germany. Class is a new phenomenon which emerges only with modern marketing integrated economies; market economies. As I said, this is the weaker part of the book. But I think this is just to start the argument. But, you know, the original accumulation comes close to theft. But he does not explain why on earth people beginning to accumulate capital. But once they had enough food to eat, and they had shelter, they were not running after money any longer. Now calculation–this is absolutely crucial for Weber. Luther said you have to be active in this life, in your occupation. And therefore Weber suggests that this non-dynamic view of history made it impossible for Lutheranism to become the real moving force, and therefore it remained too traditionalistic, and that’s why you needed Calvinism. You walk into the Calvinist church, they don’t have any pictures of saints; you know, it has a coldness of rationalism–right?–in a Presbyterian church. And what was created actually we are in “an iron cage.” Right?Calvinism, you know, rationalization of ideas could happen, but if there are no economic conditions for capitalism, it will not happen either. So this is the idea of elective affinity."
974,sociology,socy-151,lecture-17,"Diverging significantly from Marx’s idea that history can be traced by the modes of production and the economy, Weber argues that history is characterized by different modes of authority. Leaders strive to rule in authoritative ways, they attempt to legitimate their uses of power. Weber argues that throughout history, leaders have successfully established domination in three modes of authority: traditional, charismatic, and legal-rational.","I want to do what I did last time around the test; just to walk very quickly through the test questions and sort of test myself; how would I respond to them? So I will post this before my discussion section, before 7:00; exactly when, I don’t know. And he shows–right?–how–right?–in the workshop where ideas are produced, it’s actually torture and oppression what operates. But at the same time Freud has this dual attitude about civilization. So he does not want to say there is no truth at all. And this doesn’t serve him very well, because the division of labor does not capture the conflictuous relationship between classes, which eventually will have to lead to revolution. And relations of production, for most of the , is division of labor. And this is sensuous human activities between people–right?–sexual relationships. But it is not economic reductionism; if anything, it is sexual reductionism. It is a pan-erotic explanation of history. And, of course, in the United States, the received wisdom is that we are all middle-class. I would like to hear your view about this. Anyway, but you can ask the question, who is the middle-class? I mean, how you take your position, this is up to you. And, of course, he has this interesting notion of elective affinity–questions whether there is really a causal relationship between ideas and the economy. The noble savage has to be socialized into civil society. I think, if I would argue, I would say if Weber does have one, it is closer to Hobbes, because he does believe that people–the history of humankind is a struggle for power; yes, an ending struggle for power, and that’s why he explained human history with power struggles. And first of all we have to understand Weber’s theory of action which has some similarities to Hobbes and Hobbes’ theory of voluntaristic action. Or, in our interactions we can be led by tradition. In a discussion section I really hate the guts of somebody who is always speaking–right?–in the discussion section, and then I just will contradict, because I just–it is my antagonism. Now what is behind this is Weber’s fundamental methodology. And then it can come back to value rationality. This is a very not irrational behavior: well justified. Well some people actually still believe in arranged marriages. The whole idea that you see somebody, fall in love, and next day you propose, that seems to be a pretty silly thing to do. So when you are conscious about what you are doing, then you are actually acting rationally, or at least you are not acting irrationally. So you think very hard why you are doing, and you are aware what the motivation of your action is, and you can explain it to a great deal to others. And well I have my own view; many people will vehemently disagree with me. So it is not modes of production what describes the evolution of history, but types of domination which describes the evolution of history."
975,sociology,socy-151,lecture-18,"We return to Weber’s idea of domination, .  has been translated into English as “authority” and as “domination.” The translation into domination highlights the elements of power and legitimacy that are co-mingled in the concept as well as the importance of the suggestion of the asymmetrical power relationship within the concept of domination. We turn to the first way leaders legitimate their authority or domination: tradition. The primary forms of traditional rule are patrimonialism and patriachialism. For Weber, the chief difference between these forms of rule is that the patriarch rules without a staff and the patrimonial leader requires a staff that obeys his authority by virtue of personal loyalty and tradition. We end with the primary tension between traditional authority and capitalism: traditional authority systems are not motivated by profit but by satisfaction of needs.","Well, I would like very briefly to come back to Weber’s theory of domination. It is translated either as authority, or it is translated as domination. That’s, in my reading, Weber’s fundamental idea–power with an important modification. You may not like the lecturer all that much, or the way how he grades, but there were other courses you did shop for and they were even worse. That doesn’t mean that you are all that thrilled to be at lectures, and to do assignments, but you have to do it, and under the circumstances you go for the less evil. So what I tried to underline already in last lecture, that Weber’s notion of legitimacy is so much more sophisticated, so less liberal, and so much more Nietzschian than the idea we normally hear when you hear the word legitimation. Though it’s very doubtful, you know, what all those claims about the legitimacy of the system are being made; they are pretty much a mythology created around it. Marx did see human history as unfolding of modes of production. Though Weber develops these different types of domination, primarily to describe historical change–grand societies, traditional authority, charismatical authority, legal-rational authority, kind of describe the evolution of humankind–and has a similar kind of flavor than Marx’s subsequent modes of production. So there is coercion, even in legal-rational authority. And there is a great deal of personal loyalty in university situations. It is a larger scale society, or a larger scale organization, where a staff will carry out the commands of the master. As I pointed out, Weber said there is always a degree of belief or faith involved in legitimacy. When the security services in Iran began to lose faith in the Shah. The people of Iran usually did not like the Shah all that much. Again, a very Nietzschian idea, that dark read of the history, that history actually is getting worse because those who rule have more and more sophisticated means to suppress a larger number of people. There are some systems in which the elders rule; the older person has the authority. Well I don’t want to deal with this because I am running out of time. And Weber makes a crucial distinction between benefices and fiefs; these are the two ways how the staff can be rewarded in an estate-type of domination. And by this we mean if somebody has a fiefdom, it means that somebody created a sub-system over which it has control, virtually as long as that position is alive, or as that position is at least in the same organization. Of course, somebody retires, their office will be immediately taken away; the fiefdom is lost."
976,sociology,socy-151,lecture-19,"Charismatic authority, unlike traditional authority, is a revolutionary and unstable form of authority. Weber borrows the religious term of charisma and extends its use to a secular meaning. Audiences and followers believe that charismatic leaders have a close connection to a divine power, have exceptional skills, or are exemplary in some way. Charismatic leaders promise change in the future for the society and also change people’s attitudes and values; in this way, charismatic authority is revolutionary in a way that traditional and legal-rational authority are not. However, charisma is unstable and deteriorates if the leader cannot produce the changes he promises or when he confronts the contradictory logics and demands of the other types of authority. There are particular ways–including search, revelation, designation, or heredity–that charismatic successors are identified, but transferring charismatic authority is difficult and not always successful.","Incidentally, in my discussion sections, people got too excited about charisma. I will try to make a case that in fact the concept of charisma is not quite what Adolph Hitler was. So, I mean, you could have rule of law without democracy. They have some extraordinary commitment to this leader. I mean, these are very typical elements–right?–of a charismatic appeal. These are very typical elements–right?–what a charismatic leader does produce. You want to change the rules, the laws, you have to go through Congress to do that. And in a way he did that, you know, because his charisma was weakening by the 1960s. Capitalism can live nicely with authoritarian figures. Well now and charisma as a revolutionary force. I think Weber first of all makes a very specific argument. What charisma is doing is changing the value systems in you. And that’s when we have the problem how can the charismatic leader be replaced? And let me just walk you through of this. It can be designation by the original leader. And it can be office charisma; the office itself can carry charisma. Well, there can be a designation by the original leader. There’s a lot of people in the United States, as the Soviet Army defeated the Germans, first in Moscow and then of course in Stalingrad, that they began to see Stalin as a great leader–right?–as a charismatic great leader. If you are Roman Catholic, you know that the Pope has some access to God, what you, ordinary Roman Catholics, do not have. But nevertheless, even the bureaucratic kind of popes, are assumed to be charismatic and they are selected by a designated staff. And, you know, I have been department chair quite a few times, and it’s so interesting moving into the position of department chair and moving out of it. You know, I was operating in a bureaucracy, massaging the bureaucracy to get things done. But there is, right?–I think it’s a very American thing, right?–that you attach expectations to incumbents of the office, that it can actually carry out change, bring in fresh air–right?–to have a vision and to do things better than it was done before."
977,sociology,socy-151,lecture-1,"Professor Szelényi introduces the course to the students. Then he introduces each social thinker we will cover in the course: Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Weber, and Durkheim. He provides an overview of their biographies, their major works, and their major contributions.","This is a course on Foundations of Modern Social Thought. I’m a professor of sociology, a professor of political science, and it is my honor that I can introduce you to some of the Founding Fathers–I’m afraid they are all fathers right, no mothers among them; I will tell you why not–of modern social thought. John Locke, for those of you who aspire to become a doctor, was actually studying medicine and performed a surgery on a very well-known English politician. This will not be enough for you, in first reading, to get the readings on your command. So by that time you will have to have more of a sense. Please don’t drop this course because you said there are too many, too difficult readings. We have so far on the internet listed only five discussion sections, but if you want to take the course, and you do not fit into any of the discussion sections, you will be talking to me, and I will be figuring out that you will get your discussion section. I think that’s probably all housekeeping. At that time in English universities, they were mainly teaching Aristotle, and well Hobbes became very disenchanted with Aristotle, the dogmatism of Aristotle’s philosophy, and he was enthralled by the emergence of new positive science, what Galileo represented. There is a need for a superior, but a superior can also be accepted by the consent of everybody who is subjected to authority. Well it was a lot of turbulence, but interpersonal relationships were quite interesting, you’d say. You know, to be a parliamentarian in Bordeaux was boring and rather he did, he went into commerce. I have a CD of the opera and if I would know how to play music, I would show you some of his music. Well Rousseau was not quite as great a composer as Rameau but had a debate with him, and his music was to be an alternative to Rameau. You cannot be an educationalist without having read  cover to cover. This is the foundation of modern educational theory. And this is .Well one big issue is that he promotes self-interest. He wrote , , and finally on .The most important work is probably his work , which has inspired many feminists, even up to this day. And again, I will have to skip what his contributions are. Sigmund Freud is another author we will be dealing with. The major work is what you will be reading, , in 1903/1904, and sections of his major unfinished work, .Again, I’ll just skip and go to our last author, Emile Durkheim, a French social scientist, who was born in ‘ 58, as a son of a rabbi, but became an atheist later on and reconverted back to religiosity later in life–was a professor in France."
978,sociology,socy-151,lecture-20,"The purest form–the ideal type–of Weber’s legal-rational type of authority is bureaucracy. Legal-rational authority indicates that authority is invested in a set of rules and rule-bound institutions and that the creating and changing the rules are outside of the control of those who administer them; it does not mean, however, that the authority is democratic. Monarchs and even authoritarian leaders who recognize a set of laws external to their powers govern using legal-rational authority. The characteristics of bureaucracy include a fixed salary, posts based on technical skill rather than personal connections, a well-defined hierarchy, and continuous rules which bind the behavior of administrators and citizens or clients alike.","Now today’s topic is Weber’s theory of legal-rational authority and his theory of bureaucracy. When we are saying legal-rational authority, we briefly refer to the rule of law, and we tend to associate in our mind the rule of law with liberal market economies and the liberal democracies. And then a couple of ideas about his view about democracies. And then the question is who obeys what and whom, under legal authority?So and a bit about legal-rational authority. But the major point what I wanted to make–right?–that legal-rational authority, in Weber’s view, can be actually an authoritarian system. This is the essence of legal-rational authority, at least in the ideal type. We know that Berlusconi, for instance, in Italy, though Italy is really a legal-rational authority, for a long time managed–right?–to pass a legislation which enabled him to escape prosecution; though he’s probably involved in a number of criminal activities, but somehow he managed to escape criminal prosecution. It will only apply to people who are entering the program. So there is a specialized training necessary to perform certain functions, as such. It basically means that the source of rules and laws are outside of the administrator as such. And then a bureaucracy is organized into a hierarchy of offices–this is something which basically we already covered–and the offices are filled by a free contract, and in this contract what your qualification is, that’s what we call–right?–meritocracy. The bureaucracy, from the technical point of view, is the most efficient organization. And this is what makes it actually so–to fit so well with a market. And if I’m found to be incompetent, I will lose my job; but the only way to do it, is through my incompetence. To the extent substantive rationality is involved. If you are concerned with the content, that is substantive rationality. And, of course, there are other reasons how actually substantive considerations enter the game. The ethic of the legal profession is very much collegiality. So even in a collegially organized bureaucracy, there is these individual veto rights; otherwise, collegiality usually operates through the different committees and advisory boards. So therefore it is good for the economy; by what he means for the market economy. This was typical of Communist bureaucracies. Well what is crucial–right?–and Weber keeps coming back and back to this–what is vital for a capitalist economy is to be calculability and reliability. There was a great deal of concern by the bourgeoisie to give universal suffrage, because they felt then this will be unpredictable, who will win the elections."
979,sociology,socy-151,lecture-21,"Along with the macro-level shift from traditional forms of authority to legal-rational authority, Weber’s theory of class identifies a macro-level shift from status to class determining life chances. In feudal times, under traditional forms of authority, monarchs or others in power conferred high status upon individuals and material wealth followed; first a man would be named a nobleman, and then he would get his estate. In the modern capitalist era, individuals obtain their monetary or material wealth and their class position vis-à-vis the market determines their life chances. Weber, in contrast to Marx, argues that class is a modern phenomenon. However, this does not mean that our modern and contemporary world does not have versions of status. Like remnants of traditional and charismatic authority co-mingled with legal-rational authority in the state and other institutions, status still determines life chances to a certain extent. The influence of status is somewhat subsumed under Weber’s category of social class.","Well I think it is high time that you start thinking about your final paper. That will be a new paper anyway–right?–because you have to link occasionally quite distant authors to each other. This is the kind of feedback you should expect. And this is the outline of the presentation today. I disagree with it, and I will try to show you why this is the wrong approach. They probably do about as university professors do. Occasionally they can even appoint–right?–the President of the United States; if I may crack this joke. That is the way how Weber usually has been used. Anthony Giddens, I think, gets very close to what I am describing, though probably he doesn’t stick his neck out as much as I do. Well it’s primarily done, or a great deal done, by status; that you say, “Well, this is a professor who has a Ph.D., must know it.” And if you are negatively privileged in the marketplace, your life chances are not very good. But on the other hand Weber is quite clear that there are two important market positions which fundamentally define your class position, and these are the labor market and, in fact, the capital market, will define whether you are–have good life chances or poor life chances. Now just very briefly about class interest and class action. Well in order to get a university degree, you are initiated–right?–into a status group. And it’s very important: The status honor is expressed with a specific lifestyle. And well if you are a Yale professor you wear J. Press. Then you want to be driven by a limo to your workplace. And there are also specific special employment opportunities, if you belong to a status group, and it’s being controlled this way. I mean, the medical profession is a very good example. Well the market, on the other hand, knows no personal distinction. And that, I think, is a very insightful argument, at least an important qualification on Marx, or probably a useful replacement of Marx with a better fitting theory to understand modern societies. If it was good enough for me, should be good enough for my son. It is a modern version of status group, what is being constituted as a social class."
980,sociology,socy-151,lecture-22,"Emile Durkheim, a French scholar who lived from 1858 until 1917, was one of the first intellectuals to use the term “sociology” to describe his work. In the early years of his career, Durkheim’s orientation was functionalist () and positivist (); in the early twentieth century he took a cultural turn and became interested in religion (). Throughout his career, Durkheim was a methodological collectivist, and–unlike Marx and Weber, who were interested in social conflict–was consistently interested in what holds society together. Durkheim argues in  that the type of social solidarity has changed, due to the increasing division of labor, from mechanical solidarity between similar individuals to organic solidarity based on difference. Inspired by Montesquieu, Durkheim tracks this change in types of solidarity and change in what he termed the “collective conscience” by looking at a shift in law, from penal law focused on punishing individuals to restitutory law based on contract. Durkheim believed that society would function better if individuals labor at different and complementary tasks with the same vision or goal in mind.","Now we move to our last author in this course, to Émile Durkheim. Initially it was particularly the younger Durkheim, the functionalist Durkheim, who had such an extraordinary impact. Émile Durkheim identified himself and his project as sociology. So this is Émile Durkheim–born in 1858 and died in 1917. So it was a happy ending of French anti-Semitism, for awhile. Many professors are actually one book people, or at least they should have been, because their only good book was the dissertation and what they published later only published because ‘publish or perish’–right?–to get tenure; that’s why they probably published too many books. And well what he does, he uses law as a measure of social development–much like Montesquieu did, sort of–and he explains, by using the law, the legal system how the division of labor evolved, what were the stages of the development of division of labor. Durkheim was interested in social solidarity. You are familiar with Max Weber: traditional authority and legal-rational authority. Well it’s much more difficult to figure out how Weber fits into these categories. Well the French are very methodological collectivists. Anyway, he was , in the sense of being very rigorous in his analysis. I will put them on the internet and you can read it at your leisure. Marx would say it is a new legal system which emerges with legal– with capitalism, and Weber would say this is the essence of legal-rational authority. I think I already made this point, what is interesting, that Durkheim and Weber sort of ignored each other. By the way, also for Durkheim–and this is also in the text what you are reading–this distinction between mechanical and organic solidarity is developed in order to describe societies as such."
981,sociology,socy-151,lecture-23,"In the transition from mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity, brought on by increasing division of labor, industrialization, and urbanization, Durkheim argues that there will be social pathologies, which he calls anomie. These abnormal and unhealthy consequences of the change in type of social solidarity have various causes. Durkheim is best known for arguing that a lack of moral regulation leads to social pathologies, but he also argues that overregulation–in the form of forced division of labor–will lead to fatalism, a kind of anomie. Anomie resulting from excessive demands on individuals from the market is similar to Marx’s notion of alienation, although Durkheim does not use the terms alienation or exploitation. For Durkheim, anomie is an irregular form of the increasing division of labor and industrialization; it is not internal to the system itself. Durkheim’s optimism about capitalism and his position that people need regulation, similar to Hobbes’s conception of human nature, contrast sharply with Marx’s ideas.","Well I suppose you are ready for your Thanksgiving’s break. I am working on the questions for the next test. Though he stages the book with the idea of collective conscience, and goes long lengths explaining why he’s using law as an indicator of collective conscience–and we discussed that at great lengths–when it comes to describing the crucial differences between mechanical and organic solidarity, he doesn’t make much out of it really. But if you ask, well yes there is a difference in the legal system. As I mentioned, he primarily has an impact today with his later work as the cultural analyst. And it is not quite as central as it should be, especially I think in political science and sociology and anthropology. And I think this is an extremely productive way for social scientists to think about the problems of the environment. That was the way how society was organized. But they live at a very high level of technology, where we successfully pollute the air, which is, right, hard to breathe in downtown Los Angeles during a hot summer day. And anomie is one of the abnormal consequences of the division of labor. And he has been criticized about this a great deal. How do we know what is abnormal, and how on earth can we tell what is the normal state of society? But anyway he did believe that he is capable to show that some abnormal developments do take place. But interestingly enough–I have the citations for you, and if you have read the text carefully you found the citations as well–he actually also does consider that pathologies can also result from the overregulation, right, of too forced division of labor. Well in traditional societies, in mechanical solidarities, well these class conflicts were rare and unusual.” He’s not aware of where the operations required of him are leading, and he does not link them to any aim.” The competitive elements of the division of labor. And then we have Weber’s notion of disenchantment, right, the loss of the enchanted garden. Weber is developing the theory of disenchantment, what is the problem of modernity. It is the society which is the problem, not the individual. At that point Marx disagrees with Rousseau."
982,sociology,socy-151,lecture-24,"Durkheim’s  is a foundational text for the discipline of sociology, and, over a hundred years later, it remains influential in the study of suicide. Durkheim’s study demonstrates that what is thought to be a highly individual act is actually socially patterned and has social, not only psychological, causes. Durkheim’s study uses the logic of multivariate statistical analysis, which is now widely used in the discipline of sociology. Durkheim considered factors including country, marital status, religion, and education level to explain variations in suicide rates. Durkheim found that Protestants, who tended to be more highly educated, had a higher rate of suicide than Catholics, who tended to have lower levels of education. Jewish people fell outside of this pattern; highly educated, they had a very low rate of suicide. Durkheim explained that the education of Protestants led them to individual consciousness whereas the education of Jewish people meant to make them more integrated into their religious community. Durkheim arrives at a typology of suicide ranging between high and low regulation and high and low integration: egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic suicide.","Actually I didn’t realize how much interest there is amongst students in suicide. And therefore hopefully Durkheim will be exciting for you, and will help you to understand why did you consider it and why you did not do it? And I will show you one way how to do it. So there is a lot of problem in studying statistical data about suicide, and very often doctors do make judgments on the social circumstances of the person who committed suicide. So therefore what is suicide is being defined by the circumstances, rather than actually by the medical reasons. Scandinavian countries are ones where usually the suicide rate is reasonably high. And what is interesting, that within countries there are actually gigantic differences between regions. Well let me start to talk about egoistic suicide. If you don’t–you are yourself and you are not–do not feel responsible to your own group, and therefore you may be committing suicide. So in order to act egoistically means that you don’t care about others, or you care first of all about yourself, as such. Being more educated, the Protestant, makes you more susceptible to commit suicide, he argues. Well as I said, he generally finds that there is a higher rate of suicide among Protestants, and lower rates among Catholics, and Jews have the lowest suicide rates among the Judeo-Christian sphere of the world; that’s what he studied, the European countries. But that’s not quite true, Durkheim argues. But I don’t think if you commit suicide that really you are all that concerned where and how you will be buried. And Judaism actually even more tightly integrated, even more so of a community. Well in the Medieval Roman Catholic Church, only the priest read the Bible. I doubt whether you would find much religious differences in contemporary societies. But the methodological point is interesting. In terms of research design, this is very beautifully done. This is social science–right?–as we know it today. He now does a kind of interaction effect–right?–between education and religion, and he looks at this interaction effect; how these two affect each other. If you get married, statistics will tell you, you will live longer; and actually they also tell you, you will live happier, than if you stay alone. He said, well one possible explanation is that because you are in a community–right?–therefore you will not commit suicide. “ And this is a sacrifice which is imposed by society for something like a social end."
983,sociology,socy-151,lecture-25,"Durkheim understood life sciences as divided into three branches: biology, which is interested in the body, psychology, which deals with the personality, and sociology, which deals with collective representations. In , Durkheim attempted to provide methodological rules and guidance for establishing social facts and how they are related to one another.","Okay, now let me–I actually would like to spend as much time as I can on Durkheim’s methodology. The question is how can you make it interesting? Right?And then this brings us to the notion of legitimacy. But it is a rather passive notion of belief. Just the real question is how systematic that coercion should be? The basic difference is–right?–that traditional authority, you have a personal master. And you may agree or may disagree with him. There is a hierarchy of appeals; if somebody makes a mistake, how to appeal. Now we know that bureaucracies are often inefficient. Okay, the sixth question, organic and mechanical solidarity, and how this is related to Weber’s typology of authority. So I don’t have to refresh your memory as much. So there is a notion of humans needing control over them. But though he is, say, a rationalist, he sees the downside of rationalism; the loss of magic is the price what we have to pay for rationalization. Egoistic suicide occurs when you are not sufficiently integrated in society. And then he labors on what makes the social facts collective, as such. So there is this subjective element involved in this. Durkheim emphasizes no, this is not how we learn it, through acting and getting punishment and seeing others being punished. We have to define the objects of our investigations independently from our values. But what he emphasizes–right?–that they are not the individual ideas, but they are kind of crystallized, and it’s out there, over us, like things what we cannot change, individuals cannot really change. So it’s very difficult to get rid of dogmas in social sciences, because we have an ordinary knowledge–right?–not scientific but ordinary knowledge–how society and the economy operates–right?–and we have an interest as well involved. So very difficult to get rid of our preconceptions. Well he said, “Well yes, because we have very strong sentiments–and that’s okay–we should study the sentiments.” It doesn’t matter what your values are, what matters what the practices of society are. And therefore really, I think, we are calling crime abnormal if there are too much crime in society. Now I compare two societies by the level of poverty is the same, and then I will see whether it is indeed poor people are more likely to commit certain type of crimes. Today we would say, what Durkheim is suggesting, if you want to establish real causality, short of the possibility of an experimental method, you have to figure out what is the causal mechanism, what relates the two phenomena together, which are statistically correlated to each other."
984,sociology,socy-151,lecture-2,"An examination of Hobbes’s lifetime reveals that the uncertainty of the British monarchy during his life (1588-1679) inspires Hobbes’s social and political thought, especially regarding the role of the sovereign to provide for the security of his subjects. We consider the major elements of Hobbes’s political and social thought including the state of nature, equality of men, the social contract, the strong sovereign, and legitimate rule. Hobbes’s work privileges security of individuals through a strong sovereign but also asserts the right of subjects to transfer their allegiance to a new sovereign if the ruler does not provide for their security; this element of his work in particular and others made him a controversial thinker who was forced into exile for a time. His work has been rediscovered in recent years by economists and other social scientists who see him as the first rational choice theorist.","And I do something what probably not everybody does in a kind of history of ideas course: I give you an overview of the individual whom you were reading from, and around some sense of the historic times they lived in. To give those of you who are interested in the historical context, at least briefly; and those who are not particularly interested, not to bore them with it. But you can go back to the internet and get even more detail. Anyway there are a number of very important issues that Thomas Hobbes framed, and which have a great deal of impact on later social scientists–of course, on Locke, but also on Adam Smith, on Nietzsche, on Freud, on Max Weber and others. She was trying to establish Roman Catholicism but had to resign. Well whether she was a virgin or not is unclear, but she clearly had a lot of very close friendships with various men in her life. James I was already a disaster, and Charles I was a real disaster. Because in ‘51, Hobbes–and we will talk about this in great detail–was considering that probably people should be allowed to transfer their loyalty to a new authority which offers safety. Again, I would think probably half of the people in this classroom, when really think hard about it, do believe Hobbes’s argument; half of them would be violently opposed to the argument. This is the First Edition of , which came out in 1651, in two big volumes. And then the second point is we will seek power. Again an issue, a very good issue to discuss at the discussion section. Others will say we are much more benevolent. Namely, he said what comes from this equality is this unending fight; that because we desire the same thing– and he operates with the scarcity assumption, that what is desirable is actually scarce–that we’ll fight each other. And this is something who believes in equality do not want to hear; that, in fact, equality can be interpreted as the reason for social conflict, rather than the solution for social conflict. Well then we have–this is, I won’t read it; save it, this is the page you want to print, because for the rest of your life, if you ever want to cite Hobbes, this is the citation. Now about the question of social contract. And it’s controversial whether this is a useful concept at all, the state of nature. Well there are really two basic laws of nature. One law of nature is that you are forbidden what is harmful to you. Okay, now what is important in his time, to find out who the sovereign is. Montesquieu is the one which defined that checks and balances which entered the American Constitution."
985,sociology,socy-151,lecture-3,"John Locke, a liberal thinker and near-contemporary of the conservative Hobbes, disputes Hobbes’s thinking in some keys ways and builds on it in others. Locke starts his political theory with a notion of individuals in the state of nature being free, equal and reasonable; the state of nature is not synonymous with the state of war for Locke as it is for Hobbes. Locke argues that states should protect the property of individuals and must govern with the consent of subjects. Unlike Hobbes’s strong, unitary sovereign, Locke envisions a separation of the powers of the state into executive, legislative, and federative powers. We examine how Locke’s political and social thought assumes an abundance of resources while Hobbes’s thought is predicated on an assumption of scarcity.","If so, then let’s go on to John Locke, another major scientist and another major founder of political and social philosophy and theory. And this is a very important address because this is when we can learn the views of young John Locke. Well there is a New Haven connection to all of this. And I’m sure those of you who’ve visited London know exactly where the Strand is; that’s still where sort of the legal establishment can be found in London. But, you know, at that time it was kind of a defense against the Vatican and the role of the Pope. If I had to be exiled, I would prefer to be in Amsterdam, of all places. So he was actually overthrown, and then the Republicans and Democrats–I’m sorry, the Tories and Whigs–came together and they invited William to become King of England. Well I will talk about this later; the may actually be a reflection of the change to the House of Orange, which is a change from absolutism to constitutional monarchy. The is really the big text everybody reads and cites. So this inequality of power is coming from God. It actually engages him on the theological level, and he said, “Well, it’s untrue that Adam received land as a grant. And we are his property; a kind of theological argument. You see, this is a very different argument than what we have seen from Hobbes, on Tuesday. And that’s why we will have to join civil society and accept an authority. Now Locke is very interested how the sovereign, the source of power to pass legislation, is being constituted. Labor belongs to the laborer, as such, because it was created by what is yours; the only thing what certainly is yours, and this is your own body, and your laboring capacity. Well I don’t know if we can base it on–well what that really means and why on earth he makes that claim. And this becomes again very important for liberal theory. That should be prohibited and the government should step in, when they sense injury against somebody else. And it has to be the same to all parties. And, of course, in the United States you can sue the government. And it was the executive branch which  declared war and conducts war, occasionally without the consent–occasionally against the will of the House and the Senate."
986,sociology,socy-151,lecture-4,"We shift from seventeenth-century England to eighteenth-century France and from the methodological individualism of Hobbes and Locke to the methodological collectivism of Montesquieu and Rousseau. Working from a perspective that there is a general will apart and above the sum of the opinions of individuals, Montesquieu’s work focuses primarily on the law and on manners of governing rather than the question of who governs. Like Locke, Montesquieu argues that the powers of government should be separated. Montesquieu’s plan of separation between executive, legislative, and judicial powers is what the United States Constitution follows. Montesquieu asserts that the climate and environment affect men as individuals as well as society. Although many of his specific ideas seem quite silly now, we must give credit to Montesquieu for being perhaps the first social and political thinker to seriously consider the environment.","Okay, I have a lot to talk about today, and we move one century, and we move into another culture. He pretended to be more powerful than he actually was. And, of course, this is the American version with Glenn Close. He writes, publishes in 1721 already the –I talked about this before–and then he was elected on the basis of this to Académie Française, the French Academy of Sciences and Art–a very big accomplishment at this very early age. I will very briefly talk about this, law and religion, and I will skip this section all together; and law and history I’ll also skip. Montesquieu changes somewhat the discourse. This is the issue what they will call the question of legitimacy. But he said, but there is also a general spirit, a spirit which is above the individuals. Or to put it with Durkheim, the collective conscience becomes more and more important. We will see Durkheim does the same thing; this is why the legal system is so important for him. A despotic state, there are no fundamental rules. Well he’s not talking about elections, but by lot. And despotism, as we have seen, the one who governs can do whatever it wants to do, is above the law. And there is the last power, the power of judging, which has to be separated from both the legislative and executive power. So therefore you have to separate legislative and executive powers. These executive orders kind of substitute for laws or legal regulations. Well the executive power should be stable–that’s why he believes it better be in the hands of a monarch–because the government needs immediate action. Well he elaborates a number of limits of legislative power. Doesn’t give her much power, but nevertheless the idea, the Montesquieuian idea, is present in a number of Western democracies. There is a clear check of the executive over the legislature. So you are more courageous, more active and smarter if you live in cold climates, like in France or in England."
987,sociology,socy-151,lecture-5,"Jean-Jacques Rousseau had a colorful early life. Orphaned at ten, he moved in with a woman ten years his senior at sixteen. Their probable love affair is the subject of Stendhal’s book . Rousseau was friends and sometimes enemies with many major figures in the French Enlightenment. Although he did not live to see the French Revolution, many of Rousseau’s path-breaking and controversial ideas about universal suffrage, the general will, consent of the governed, and the need for a popularly elected legislature unquestionably shaped the Revolution. The general will, the idea that the interest of the collective must sometimes have precedence over individual will, is a complex idea in social and political thought; it has proven both fruitful and dangerous. Rousseau’s ideas have been respected and used by both liberals and repressive Communist and totalitarian leaders.","So today is Jean Jacques Rousseau–I mean, one of the most fascinating people in terms of his life and his ideas and the way how he reasons. But there are few people who turn my mind on so much than Jean Jacques. Here you can see, you know, Madame Warens and Jean Jacques, meeting in 1728. That’s what he really believed in, unlike Rameau who was much more analytical and emphasized harmony. And the idea is–this is the origins of inequality; we are jealous, right? Did you have occasionally a little sense of jealousy in you, and thinking no, this other one should not have the one I do have? is really a culmination of the contractarian argument. Now Rousseau, as we will see, adds a new, interesting element. General will that you–and I will quote Jean Jacques for you when he said, “the individuals will have to be forced to be free”; that follows from the idea of general will. But Durkheim loved him too, and he was a liberal. Robespierre, the major disciple and believer of general will, his head was also chopped off. First he went back to Geneva, but figured out he doesn’t like Geneva any longer. Book I is a description how you move from natural right–from the state of nature–to political right. That is a bit of a tricky argument which has been abused in history. And the executive is still by an aristocracy, by the wise man–that’s what he really means by aristocracy, an intellectual aristocracy who is elected. It does happen to some people in their life. We will see this also in .Well, the second theme is about the question of diluted justice."
988,sociology,socy-151,lecture-6,"The general will – dangerous if taken too far – operates in many elements of our social and civic life. Immunizations that are compulsory for living in dorms serve the common good – the general will – regardless of individual will. The general will operates in society when individuals develop not only , selfish love, but also , love of self in relation to others. Rousseau distinguished between bourgeois individuals who have  and citizens who exemplify . In addition to being a political and social thinker, Rousseau is an early and influential education theorist. In his book , Rousseau argues that individuals are born good but are corrupted by society. He advocates “negative education” which aims at reducing mental errors that students may pick up in society. Negative education, Rousseau argues, is accomplished by focusing on educating students on how to think rather than training them in what to think.","Then let’s go on to Jean Jacques Rousseau and . Yeah, before I go–so I have to come back because there is one more chore, household chore. I talked about this as a good example of methodological collectivism; that Rousseau, unlike Hobbes or Locke, or we will see later on Mill or Adam Smith, does not believe that studying the individual actions we can understand what is society and what the need of the society is. And this idea carried on in social theory among those whom we will discuss, particularly by Émile Durkheim. And, in fact, he argues that not the government but we, the wise philosophers–we, the intellectuals–we know better what people’s interests are. “ And the big question is can we be citizens without being bourgeois? It is erotic love, which is in your mind as much as in your sexual drives. When we are thirteen or fourteen, and we suddenly realize that there is romantic stuff but we don’t have the object of our romantic feelings, we have to find this out. Right?Okay, then he says love brings different people together on the basis of differences. This is very much a Durkheimian idea of what binds people together can be their differences. And he makes a very provocative argument: men and women are different. And then he gives–though he was not much of a believer–he gives a bit of theological argument: “Everything is good as it leaves the hands of the author of things  and everything degenerates in the hands of man.” “ Well whether it is true or not, that’s another question. The words  and  will be proscribed from the Lexicon. So the argument, , is the wrong way to approach. But, on the other hand, tell people what is necessary, what are the limitations of your action. That’s when we will have .And the third maxim is, well: “The pity one has for another’s misfortune is measured not by the quantity of that misfortune but the sentiment one attributes to those who suffer it.” I think really ironic but a very deep idea. This is one of my favorite sentences in Rousseau. Well I will suspect that most of you will see him as a sexist. But some of you may actually see the points what he’s making in this last set of quotations."
989,sociology,socy-151,lecture-7,"Adam Smith’s ideas about self-interest should be understood as a precursor in some ways to John Stuart Mill’s thinking on utilitarianism. Professor Szelényi discusses, but does not resolve, the complexities of Adam Smith’s moral and ethical positions staked out in including a focus on sympathy – and the most widespread economic interpretation of Smith and  that he is the economist of self-interest. One way to reconcile these so-called “two Smiths” is that, as social beings, it is in our self-interest to express benevolence and sympathy toward others. Mill, the student of Bentham since a very young age, humanizes the theory of utilitarianism. Perhaps he should be best remembered for his staunch views on liberty: liberty must never be compromised for the sake of expediency.","Well I made some adjustment today to the syllabus, and I hope you don’t mind. I do make this adjustment to make the test more enjoyable for you. Now let me also, before I get into Adam Smith, very briefly do some household chores. He meets Voltaire and Quesnay, a major economist of his time, and other representatives of French Enlightenment. Regularly, normally today, if you take economics classes, he is presented as the person who is advocating the self-interested individual and a committed theorist of the self-regulating markets, of the invisible hand– as little government as possible, pursue just your self-interest, and your self-interest will lead to the common good. I’m not sufficiently a Smith scholar to be able to do so. But Adam Smith already here asked this question, and he said, well “what’s the solution?”That inside you there is an inner person. There are some people who always blame others if things go wrong. And this, I think, is the way how he is being read. In fact, I will talk about this later on. The term, the word, invisible hand, the term, comes up three times in his work. And this is the context in which he’s using the invisible hand, as it is being interpreted mostly today by Adam Smith theorists. Watch yourself when you are coining a term because a term occasionally can stick and then it will be always attributed to you, even if you use it once in your life. Few people accept today the labor theory of value; Smith or Marx, no matter what. So what is fun, that three instances where the notion of the invisible hand is used, in each case a different meaning, and in none of the cases exactly the same meaning as we normally understand it. Okay, well and this can be actually quantified. If he would have been a real feminist, he probably should have put on his work Harriet Taylor as a co-author; she probably co-authored this work. And he said–and nobody argues it more forcefully than him–“Individual liberty is the ultimate value, and expediency”–and you know what he means by expediency, that you get there by using the least means and you maximize the return–“expediency cannot justify intervention against individual liberty.” He is for the sanctity of the liberty of the individual, and he’s the ultimate of British individualism and the sacredness of British individualism. And he argues that in a very articulate way. But he believes that in marriage they can create a friendship bond with males."
990,sociology,socy-151,lecture-8,"John Stuart Mill made important and influential amendments to Bentham’s ideas of utilitarianism. Perhaps most influentially, Mill states that there are not only different quantities of happiness but also qualitative differences in happiness. Humans are capable of higher forms of happiness, and therefore utility must be judged by taking into account quantitative amounts as well as qualitative differences in forms of happiness. Mill also drew a distinction between legality and justice; what is just is not always written in law, and what is written in law is not always just. Justice is a higher principle than the law. Mill’s ideas have been incorporated into the laws of the United States and many people who live here subscribe to his ideas; the United States has some of the most permissive laws ensuring the freedom of speech of all liberal, free democracies. However, Mill’s argument that liberty must never be sacrificed for expediency has been subject to debate in the United States since 9/11/01. In keeping with his views on liberty, Mill held radical views on women for his time; he believed in educational, political (voting), and marital equality for women. Mill believed women are not inferior by nature. Professor Szelényi ends class by going over how he would answer the questions for the first exam with the students.","Let me just one more time to say John Stuart Mill is formidably influential, very influential on our days. These are the main themes of his book on utilitarianism, the way how he departs from Bentham–a very important change that he’s beginning to emphasize there are higher happinesses we can seek. So we have imagination, what animals don’t have. Now you can see–I mentioned that about Adam Smith, that Adam Smith might have had this theory of sympathetic humans, which in a way pointed this direction. There are many people who disagree with it. Well the pleasure of the beast might be felt as degrading by a human being. And if you are in comparative literature or English, of course the aesthetic theories of Schiller, the German poet, who emphasized how important actually imagination and play is in figuring out what beauty is. And I think this is a very powerful point. But you can argue it’s necessary to defend other people’s freedom. You may want to have a legislation which eliminates the death penalty. He said we have actually a sense that justice is somehow related to equality–that we occasionally feel that some degree of inequality is already unjust. We just heard this debate the last couple of weeks. Well how far you go with this argument–it again can be very controversial. And what follows from this, individualism and liberty; these are the major values, rather than just satisfying our needs. Well this is an extremely important idea, and very much an idea of John Stuart Mill. Denying the Holocaust and you end up in jail in Germany. And therefore we do need law and order, we do need some intervention. The law is there, and then it enters the individuals. Where does it come from, if it is not in any individual consciousness, right? And you can say, “Well this opens up the door to totalitarianism.” Let’s have free, unregulated markets, and then it will end up with the collective good. You can add the footnote there is a controversy about this, but most people today in the twenty-first century interpret Adam Smith as the person of the invisible hand and small government. We need regulation, and just see what George W. Bush did. And this is what I would like to hear from you."
991,sociology,socy-151,lecture-9,"Marx begins his intellectual life as a Young Hegelian, in the company of Bruno Bauer and others. The Young Hegelians, a radical group of scholars, intended to subject Hegel’s theories to critical scrutiny. Eventually, Marx breaks with this tradition altogether by saying that alienation does not come from thoughts and therefore cannot be solved by ideas alone. Alienation comes from material conditions and can only be addressed by changing those conditions. Due to his radical, revolutionary ideas, Marx was forced to move around Europe quite a bit. In his lifetime, he saw his predictions about the uprising of the working classes come to fruition in some places, but he also saw these revolutions fail, including the short-lived Commune in France. Next time, we see how the young Marx who is occupied with Hegelian thought and the concept of alienation transitions to a more mature Marx with the concept of the capitalist mode of production.","Okay, so now we move into the nineteenth century. But Karl Marx did get into the middle of it; he was born in 1818 and died in ‘83.And I tried to find a picture of Marx, what you may not have seen, when he was still quite a good-looking guy. He attended, of course, high school in Trier. They were the radicals of their time, and Marx already wanted to be a radical; he just did not know what kind of radical he will be or should be. That is really the fundamental line of argument that greatly influenced Marx. Now Feuerbach’s most important book–I don’t think it is in English–, he also suggested that rather than God creating man, man created the idea of God, and they created the idea of God–this is actually not all that far from Bruno Bauer, just a more radical position. This is the materialist’s approach, when you explain ideas from the material conditions, versus the other way around. And what he’s writing is just liberal journalism. But there are some very important things in ; just the price you have to pay to find the jewel is very high. Well there is–to continue the work–a big change in Marx in 1945 –as some people say, the epistemological break. But even if you hate it or love it, you better read it, and you pay attention to some of the very important statements. Paris, Vienna, Buda and Pest, Berlin, whole Europe is on fire. In two weeks it is suppressed and overthrown. He believes in the ordinary people and he wants to get rid of the state, rather than doing stuff by the state. Queen Victoria–right?–ethical conservativism. But there is a kind of intellectual project for the young Marx. It is a critique of the French Revolution and the bourgeois society in which Hegel felt the workers and the capitalists are representing particularistic interests, and order can be brought into this only by civil servants, by the government, who represents the universal point of view. As I said, he does not have the notion of capitalism. So the first point is there is in–you know, we are talking about commodity producing commercial societies, to put it with Adam Smith. Under these conditions, this realization of labor appears as the loss of realization of the worker. And this is why, you know, in the act of production you have alienation. There are animals which kind of work, like bees, but they don’t work with a plan. So we are alienated from our very human essence. And he said this is the worst alienation."
992,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-10,"González Echevarría starts by commenting on three of the returns and repetitions (characters who reappear and incidents that, if not repeated, recall previous incidents) that take place at the end of part one of the  and which give density to the fiction: the galley slaves, Andrés, and the postprandial speech or the speech on arms and letters. Don Quixote’s insanity not only gives him a certain transcendence, but also shows the arbitrariness of laws, which causes their rejection by society and other characters’ insane behavior. González Echevarría comments on the intersection between literature and history before moving on to the captive’s tale, the culmination of those intertwined stories, in which religious conversion overcomes social barriers and transcends the neo-platonic convergence of opposites in Renaissance plots. With his creation of Don Quixote, the first hero-fugitive from justice in the Western tradition–a “highway robber,” as the officer of the Holy Brotherhood calls him–Cervantes has created the first important novelistic protagonist drawn from the legal archives. His is the case of the insane hidalgo who set out to act out chivalric fantasies and in the process committed a series of crimes. And yet, he is the agent of Providence.",": We are moving towards the end of Part I, that is, the 1605 , and as we move towards the end, I’m sure you will have noticed that there are a number of returns and repetitions which give density to the fiction by being cross-referenced, as it were, within itself, meaning that there are characters who reappear and incidents that are, if not repeated exactly as before, recall previous incidents. It was a set topic, arms against letters. It is a book in which these modes of behavior are codified, these ideal modes of behavior. You remember the word  from one of the earlier classes, ‘wit’ — remember the book by Huarte de San Juan, the doctor, and remember, ‘’ is in the title,  —  meant that Cervantes was an unlearned wit, a natural. Well, in that book Américo Castro writes, .Absorb that, the intellectual arm with theoretical reason is getting ready to intervene in the fate of Europe. He says:“We are, again, faced with the essentially Cervantean dualism, epic heroic fantasy versus reason and reflexive criticism. However, Don Quixote does favor arms over letters, as he says, and the fact is that he has just won the battle with the giant, of which the speech is a kind of celebration, so he opts for arms over letters, perhaps with Cervantes himself, who always had a fondness for his life as a soldier, as you, no doubt, noticed in reading the tale of the captive. Here man tastes the world, introduces it into his body, makes it part of himself. So the truth has prevailed in the resolution of all of the conflicts, and Don Quixote celebrates with his speech, and he, the mad man, has been the vehicle of that resolution. Of course, we might add here that Cervantes’s self as author has been presented as a sort of thin, ambiguous and shifting fiction, and that what stand behind it are these snippets of autobiographical revelation underlined by these self allusions, like those to his pastoral romance , in the scrutiny of the boos episode, and to  as Don Quixote leaves the inn — This is the story you’re reading for next Thursday, everything is made to be coordinated in this course. The tale, I maintain, could be seen as the counterpart of sixteenth century Spanish mystical poetry in which courtly love, about which I’ve spoken at length here, and Petrarchan conventions are adapted to express religious fervor and union, not merely with the beloved, but with God. I’m mentioning it just so as not to leave any of these stories unmentioned. So Ciriaco observes that this has been very closely followed in the book. I have maintained in that book that the picaresque and hence Cervantes’s novel reflects the importance of the elaboration of a dense and complicated legal system in sixteenth century Spain. So the archive was a form of state control containing many stories from which the picaresque novel derived or drew its cases, like the one involved in  and . Lazarillo’s story is like a deposition given to a judge to justify his present predicament. His is the case of the insane  who set out to act out chivalric fantasies and in the process committed a series of crimes."
993,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-11,"The lecture focuses on the ending of the first part of the , which for the seventeenth-century reader was, simply, the end because no second part existed yet or was envisioned. Probably because it represents a difficult process (since the  is not an ordinary story with a clear beginning) the end is already contained in the prologue, which also works as an epilogue echoing the characteristics of the meta-novel. With this in mind, González Echevarría comments on episodes that constitute partial endings: the caging of Don Quixote, and the prophecy contrived by the barber foretelling a possible ending for Don Quixote’s fantasies. The conversation among Don Quixote, the priest and the canon of Toledo, who ironically is the “idle reader” from the prologue and a critic of chivalric romances, explores the multiple possibilities of the romances of chivalry, which Cervantes follows in his novel, with the Poetics of Aristotle in the background. The episode is also a critique of Lope de Vega and his innovative plays. Here is one of the great ironies in literary history: that Cervantes, while being wildly original in narrative fiction, was exceedingly conservative in the theater. Don Quixote’s arrival at his village has made him madder; it is now the space of the uncanny and the unfamiliar.",": I have been speaking in the last lectures about the ending of Part I of the, and today we finally get to the end of the novel. Because second parts were often written in the sixteenth century, second parts of chivalric romances had many parts. Now, Don Quixote is an outlaw, as we saw in the arrest order read by the Holy Brotherhood trooper — remember, the one who can’t read very well — who apprehends him after the fracas at the inn. Alonso Quixano, the , the modest  from that place in la Mancha, can be arrested or apprehended, but not Don Quixote, who is an invented literary character, unless it is within the world of his fiction; hence the make-believe. Forgiven them, allowing them the freedom to cage him in a way. Like the priest, the barber is an author, but also an actor besides. So, you see, this is the projected ending within the fictions, or beyond even the fictions Don Quixote has invented. So this is yet another level, those levels that the novel shows throughout created by characters. is a book in which el Pinciano expounds literary theory mostly derived from Aristotle’s . That is, when we talked about incest, and the prisoner of sex, who would determine what is incest and what is not, whom you can marry and whom you cannot marry, and what is a sin, and not a sin, and so forth. That is to say, the novel does not comply with the theory propounded by the Canon of Toledo, but flows from within its own practice. A little background on Aristotelian theory, although I think that the best thing to approach this passage of the Canon of Toledo which, of course, has generated a lot of criticism, because all you have to do is give a scholar a set of rules that were being propounded and a novel, and scholars think that art is written following rules; it is delusion of scholars and critics. You cannot really pinpoint him as to what Cervantes’s preference is in all of this, but I think that the point to remember is that the canon is a slightly ridiculous figure, that we cannot take him as a figure of authority who has given us the poetics of the by any means, that he himself has tried to write a romance of chivalry. You will see that religious figures appear in the, well, the priest has been around the whole first part. It is, again, a way of lending substance to the book by these inner references. Perhaps the circularity of the event, coming back again has made him dizzy to the point that he cannot recognize even his own bed. It is not that they go to the galleys or that they are nabbed or they have to write a story because they are married to the mistress of an archpriest and so forth — I’m alluding to .I think the other very significant element here is Monipodio’s brotherhood, Monipodio is the chief criminal here, who runs the whole brotherhood in very well organized fashion."
994,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-12,"González Echevarría talks about the transition that we, as present-day readers undergo, between Part I, published in 1605, and Part II of the , published in 1615. He first reviews the grand themes of part one: 1) ambiguity and perspectivism, 2) the idea that the self can impose its will but only to a certain point and the ontological doubt, 3) reading, 4) characters that are relational and not static, and 5) improvisation. He then moves on to Part II of the book: Cervantes’ moment as a writer, the cultural context, the titles of both parts and the spurious Avellaneda’s  are commented upon. The second half of the lecture talks about the writing of the second part of the novel and its main characteristics in relation to Part I.",": Today, I’m going to talk about the transition from Part I to Part II of the; our transition, not Cervantes’s transition. In other words, perspectivism suggests an Archimedean principle outside of the plot — and the Archimedes must be Cervantes himself ”Spitzer adds: “And we may see in Cervantes’ two-fold treatment of the problem of nicknames  toward language. Self-doubt is the precondition to inventiveness, to the play of the imagination. The is a book about reading, and its protagonist is first and foremost a reader. Are these lapses on the part of Cervantes or part of the aesthetics of the book? I would like to think that it is part of the aesthetics of the book, and that the air of improvisation is very much inline with the book’s informal tone, with the fact that its origin is presumably a found manuscript whose discovery is episodic, and whose redaction seems to be concomitant with the action, and the reading, most notoriously, the prologue. Cervantes was an instant success with Don Quixote, and he moved to Madrid in 1616. Miguel’s last years in Madrid were relatively serene. You will be meeting them, as I said, at the beginning of Part II, when the characters discuss them and discus some of this advice to the — and Don Quixote himself act as an  by giving some advice on how to take care of the threat of the Turks, coming down again after the defeat in Lepanto. From evidence and documents and statements by Cervantes and others and so forth about how the novel was developed; you will see that Part II is quite long. You have a treat in store because, in my view, Part II is better than Part I, if that is possible, although scholars argue back and forth about this, but I think there’s no question Part II is a superior book and is even much more complicated, and complicated by the fact that characters in Part II have read Part I, adding to the game of mirrors, and you will find this in the very early chapters of Part II. Nothing that occurs in their travels is entirely finished. Even worse, after chapter XXXVI  after chapters XXXVI, they have to fight off another image of themselves, the bogus image in the crooked mirror of Avellaneda’s fake second part, the false . ”The allusion here is to Luigi Pirandello, a great Italian playwright of the twentieth century who wrote a famous play called ; so Cervantes’ characters are disputing other characters, their reality or fictionality."
995,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-13,"The modern novel that develops from the  is essentially a political novel and an urban genre dealing with cities. In Part II there is a sense of the text being written and performed in the present because it incorporates current events, such as the expulsion of the , a critic of the  and a satire of the aristocracy. In part two of the Part I plays the role that the romances of chivalry played in Part I: the characters have read the first part and so a new larger mirror has been added to the play of mirrors that was already present. Characters evolve within a social context, which is consonant with the political character of the novel and has much to do with the development and evolution of realism in literature in the representation of everyday life and of common people. An explanation of the Baroque aspects that appear in the second part of the novel helps to understand the  as a whole and its relation with the first part.",": I want to begin today by mentioning a virtual literary fact, a story that does not happen; one that only exists in the ‘as if’ of literature. You will have the village of El Toboso and Barcelona. It is being improvised on the go; in addition, and as already remarked, many characters have read Part I, which serves as the background, as a model, as it were, for Part II. We already had had intimations of this in Part I, the novel being scripted and written as the novel takes place: in the episode of the dead body, when Sancho gives Don Quixote the moniker the Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance, the hidalgo remarks that the writer must have put the idea in Sancho’s head, suggesting that the novel is being written as they perform it. The priest was the graduate of a lesser university, not quite Salamanca. He is called Sansón, to begin the part of the satire is that he is called Sansón but he is quite small; he is not a giant like the Samson of the Bible. To judge by comments he makes, he was also a reader of Boiardo and Ariosto, so Sansón spent his time at Salamanca reading literature, not studying theology, which is what he was supposed to do. In Part II, Sansón is the main author within the book. Sansón and others, like the duke’s steward, whom you will meet soon enough, will be authors within the fiction we read and will script the action and watch it unfold, most of the time not like they intended it to. As author figures they are, but particularly Sansón, quite complex and modern, their intentions rarely match their results. Part II is a text in the making; we learn this quite early in chapter V, in the episode when Sancho goes home to convince his wife that he must accompany Don Quixote again. It is a text that is erased as it is being written and that should disappear as we read it. This is hilarious, which is why he corrects her mistakes when she misspeaks. So if you have a chance read that obituary note but I’ll give you a thumbnail sketch of Auerbach and his theories. The next quote is from René Wellek — whom I mentioned before, a great professor of comparative literature here, of Czech origin — the concept of Baroque and literary scholarship; this is a little denser because it has to do with the critical concept of the Baroque but I want you to have an idea of it. But Part I still contains many elements of what could still be called Renaissance aesthetics. There is a  quality to it, and the  as I have been saying, is typical of the Baroque. I am going to leave it there, except to point out that I have given you in the handout with a map of Spain behind you will see a quote from Gracián, , which is the definition of  that I am going to begin the next lecture with, as I apply it to the evolution, the unfolding of the plot of the."
996,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-14,"Commentary of the key concepts of Spanish Baroque, , introduces González Echevarría’s suggestion that the plot of the  follows a Baroque unfolding from deceit () to disillusionment (). The discussion of Don Quixote and Sancho about knight-errants and saints is not only about arms and letters, but about good actions for their own sake and for the sake of glory (or deceit). This discussion echoes the religious debates of the time and shows Don Quixote’s broad knowledge of them, anticipating Part II’s projection beyond Spain. The episode in El Toboso announces much of the mood of Part II with the darkness and the urban scenario. The lie of the enchanted Dulcinea is important because it will leave a deep imprint in the knight’s subconscious and because it is the first episode in which the roles of Don Quixote and Sancho are reversed. The lecture ends with the comment on the episode of the cart carrying actors and all its baroque connotations.",": Something that I will be charting as we move through the episodes that make up Part II is how they are reminiscent of others in Part I; how, in many cases, these episodes in Part II are rewritings of episodes in Part I. This is an issue that doesn’t have to be just stated, but also pondered. ’This concept is fundamental to Part II because the whole plot of the novel seems to be moving towards disillusionment. So let me give you some definitions of  and comment on them so that we can have as clear a concept, as clear an idea of this concept as possible. Now I am more convinced than ever that all is upside down in this world. As you can see, the plot of the play, which I have simplified, goes from deceit, the first visit to the palace, to disillusionment, when Segismundo awakens back in the tower, and wisdom, when he comes to know that life is like a dream, as are political power, the trappings of government, and everything else. I suppose that he refers to Saint George particularly, and adds that not everyone can be a monk, he says. Now, one can see, of course, that because Sancho has been influenced by Don Quixote, their arguments are like discussions the knight could be having within himself, or with himself. Now, of course, this is a very profound philosophical statement, a suggestion, but it also crucial in the development of modern fiction. In Part II, we are beginning to enlarge Don Quixote’s library, we cannot reduce it to the romances of chivalry that we found with the barber and priest in the scrutiny of the books, but he had read other things. There’s less of this in Part II and more of shelter, more of architecture, and this is why the discussion on roman architecture is important, above all, in the context of humanism, and the Renaissance, and the copying of Rome’s architecture and the, of course, the development of what will become Baroque architecture, and that scheme that I gave you about Beinecke Plaza, Sterling Memorial; you blend them, force them together and you get the Baroque. The farmhand they meet is singing a song about a great defeat which adds to the omens, the bad omens. These sounds here are scary by virtue of the fact that you cannot see their source, you can only hear. Here, El Toboso appears as a haunted city with blind allies and peopled by strangers, the farmhand, who do not know anything about it. The farmhand is an outsider who cannot give them directions. It recalls seeing the depths of the soul in the darkness of night. He will be, in this sense, like Sansón Carrasco and like the Duke’s steward who will appear later. He is the inventor of the Don Juan figure, a great legacy then, in literature and music and so forth — At least two of Don Juan’s conquests in Tirso de Molina’s play,  are from the lower classes, one a peasant and the other a fisher woman. They usually have plots drawn from scripture, but also plots drawn from classical mythology. They were surrounded by a troop of men on horses, well, armed and carrying banners."
997,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-15,"González Echevarría starts by reviewing the Spanish baroque concept of . He proposes that the plot of the and some of the stories in part two unfold from deceit () to disillusionment (). He then turns his attention to Auerbach and Spitzer’s essays included in the  (“Enchanted Dulcinea” and “Linguistic Perspectivism” respectively) that try to describe what González Echevarría calls the “Cervantean,” the particularities that define Cervantes’ mind and style. In the second part of the lecture he comments on the episodes assigned for this week trying to explain their main characteristics and correspondence with part one. Doubting is common in Part II of the, suggesting that the characters meet with themselves to find meaning and identity. The lecture ends with the comments on one of Cervantes’ , “The Glass Graduate.”",": I want to return briefly to “,” because there may be some confusion caused by “disillusionment,” the English word used to translate the term, which is an approximation as all translations are. “ Besides, we are not familiar in the modern period any more with this separation of styles, of high and low styles or anything like that, and it’s very instructive to read Auerbach, who was steeped in that, even when he goes astray, in my view. You have these words in your essays, so I don’t have to put them on the board, I know that they are jawbreakers: polynomasia, multiple names; and polyetymology, multiple origins of words, meaning multiplicity of names and multiplicity of word origins that are present in the scenes that he analyzes. Spitzer equates the multiplicity implicit in these — in the words — to the perspectivism inherent in the interplay of varied views in the novel by various characters. The differences of opinion among the characters is evinced through the use of language. Joyce uses them in funny ways, a passenger in Joyce is the “,” which in French means “not yet. Behind Cervantes, the creator, there is God, whom Cervantes never denies. So Middle Ages, Renaissance and Baroque; correspondence: word things, words to words and then words who are deceitful and purveyors of , and then leading to .Now, I am very interested, because I think it is useful for us as readers and as students of literature in the Cervantean, according to Auerbach and Spitzer — to me the most interesting part of Auerbach’s essay is ultimately when he tries to define the Cervantean, “,” which can be compared with Spitzer’s effort to come to a similar overall view. ”I think he’s right, when he says something like that. Moreover, Cervantes plays so much with the author’s lack of authority that one has finally to take him at face value and agree that not even he has the final authority of the book that we read. We will talk about that, when we talk about the puppet play that Ginés de Pasamonte puts on, here in Part II. Now we turn to the assigned episodes in the. A great number of green, yellow, and white feathers waved about his helmet.”. The size, the color, the carbuncles, and the crookedness, so disfigured his face, that Sancho, at sight thereof, began to tremble hand and foot, like a child in a fit, and resolved within himself to take two hundred cuffs before his choler should awaken to encounter that hobgoblin. Notice the exaggerated dimensions and utter hideousness of the nose, which together with its being artificial and new features of Part II. Sancho seems to be saying that it is the upper classes that start wars, a very deep critique. He is reasonably well off, reads devotional books, hunts, and lives an honest peaceful life at home. The plot is circular, and circularity is expressed through Tomás’s very last name. He is found lying down under some trees by the young gentlemen who take him to Salamanca; he is their servant for eight years, but also acquires an education showing a remarkable intelligence, though this is only reported, not dramatized, until he’s ill; he is always in a second plane as it were. This is how she lures him into eating it, but there is no hint of what makes him attractive to her, other than perhaps his fame as a brilliant scholar."
998,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-16,"The loose format of the  allows for the incorporation of different stories and texts, such as the Camacho’s wedding, which was going to be a play. The episode, a form of epithalamium based on the myth of Pyramus and Thisbe, states one of the main themes of part two, that art corrects nature. As a way of turning deceit, which would normally lead to disillusionment, into a happy ending, in Camacho’s wedding episode art helps nature to attain good ending. González Echevarría claims that in this episode there is a subtext in which marriage is not only a legal institution but also a transcendental metamorphosis of matter, or transubstantiation. The literal blending of bloods that makes marriage indivisible is echoed here through what González Echevarría calls ‘the itinerary of blood.’ In the interpretation of the myth Cervantes resembles Velázquez in that they both show the inner recesses of representation: they show creation as a layered process that ultimately involves the real.",": As we approach the episode of Camacho’s wedding it should be readily apparent that it was — the story was going to be a play. Given that it has a happy ending its safe to assume that it was going to be a comedy. It is a feature that the novel will continue to have and that in the modern period, of course, will be exploited to the very limits. Compare this with the very frugal meal that Don Quixote had at that very first inn, when he ate fish because it was Friday. Abundance, contrasted with the starkest want is typical of the aesthetics of the Baroque, this clash, and abundance ties in with the notion of sensuality, the sensuality of Cervantes’s art that Auerbach spoke about in the essay that you have all read, and that he says is the hallmark of Cervantes’ work. The sensual, the tangible, in all its abundance, turns into a simulacrum and reveals its opposite, which is quite literary death. One could also see in that impaled calf a scapegoat, which is typical of feasts and of celebrations. Now, the episode is a prose epithalamium, and I think better write this — a poem or song in praise of the bride or groom or both from the Greek “,” “at,” and “,” “nuptial chamber” — and a verse epithalamium is actually performed as part of the wedding celebration, if you remember, quite an elaborate one at that. So the myth of  hangs heavily over this episode. It is a way of turning deceit, which would normally lead to disillusionment, into a positive force that leads to a happy ending. The story is a rewriting of the love stories of Part I that turn on unequal marriage and that involve the issue of secret marriages, which, as I said, were the hot topic of the day which was taken up by the Council of Trent. Then he has both Quiteria and himself utter the words about free consent that would legitimize the marriage before church and society. To consume and to consummate go together in a wedding celebration, as I said earlier. And “componerse” means to dress up, of course, but also to recover from an illness. And then we turn off the lights and I have to let my eyes adjust so that I can read my notes. With his brush he banishes the gods as if smacking them with a broom  in his  [which is this painting, known in Spanish as , ] there is not only no Baccus but a rascal impersonating Baccus. ”This marvelous painting hangs at the Prado Museum, and if you remember the words by Auerbach about the subtle plastic nature of Cervantes’ art, of his depiction of things and of sensuous, you can see that there is, besides the connection I’m trying to establish here, a kinship between Cervantes’ art and that of Velázquez, and you can imagine these characters as appearing in episodes of the, I’m sure. It is a woven copy of Tizian’s   — Could you give me that painting? We see the contemporary weavers in relation to the classical fable, and we see at the center of Velázquez’s painting a quotation from a masterpiece."
999,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-17,"This lecture covers two of the most important episodes of Part II of the : the descent into Montesinos cave and Master Peter’s puppet show. The first one, on the one hand, engages the main literary topics and sources of the novel. Cervantes, by submitting Don Quixote’s fantasies to natural law, questions the belief in the authenticity of the romances of chivalry and the reality of what his protagonist sees. The episode also provides a glimpse into the inner workings of Don Quixote’s subconscious: his descent is a harsh look onto himself which, while not completely destroying his beliefs, weakens them seriously, and from now on he will act saner. Master Peter’s puppet show introduces again Ginés de Pasamonte, the character who represents the figure of the modern author in both parts of the novel. With Ginés now disguised as a master puppeteer, Cervantes criticizes his contemporary playwright Lope de Vega, but most importantly, through the complex  that the puppet show constitutes, Cervantes analyzes the act of mimesis.",": So we are going to talk today about two of the most significant episodes of Part II of the, episodes that mark a transition to — that begin the sort of the down slope of the novel as it moves towards its conclusion. Although there are also sources in chivalric romances, this is an adventure on a higher literary level, this is not just going back to episodes in the chivalric romances but Homer, Virgil, Dante. If you have read your American literature you see that in Tom Sawyer, and Huckleberry Finn, and so forth, there are episodes where the characters go into caves, but here, I think, the sources are those that I mentioned. Nothing, not even art, is immune from death in this world of the cave. It is a topic of Renaissance literature as the most pleasant of place, and this is where he lands, and presumably where he has his dream. , Is this a , an atavistic return to the womb? It is said that need or necessity is everywhere in passing; the world of magic is invaded by needs and physical laws and what ensues are grotesque images. Now, there are many literary antecedents to the cave of Montesinos episode, and I have already mentioned: Homer, Virgil and Dante, but the originality of the episode is not so much the descent into the cave as that it reveals Don Quixote’s subconscious. Anthony Cascardi, an American hispanist, links the episode to the dream argument in Descartes and makes quite a few valuable observations about Don Quixote as a whole, particularly about the entire debate about the relationship between reality and fantasy. Cervantes shows that we relate to the world, including the world of our own experiences, in ways other than what the epistemologists call knowledge, and that all we know of the world cannot be characterized in terms of certainty. Now, I have made a crude drawing on the blackboard that will help me explain the episode; it is sketchy, I understand; it is more Picasso than Velázquez, let’s put it that way, but you can recognize some of the figures: that, of course is Ginés de Pasamonte, that is the speaker, the boy who speaks; that is Don Quixote; that is Sancho, and then the rest of the audience, and, of course, the puppet show as best as I could render it. Like the imagined friend of the 1605 prologue — remember the imagined friend whom Cervantes says comes to visit him and helps him write that prologue — this modern author does not have a conventional or a deep classical education and has to rely on compendia and books of familiar quotations for his erudition. Before, Ginés converging side access distorted reality — we have gone over this. Ironically, by eliminating one eye, Ginés is overcoming the problem of non-converging sidelines; it is a radical way of doing so but now he lacks perspective. Remember the episode with the Canon of Toledo where there was a protracted discussion and critique of Lope for just grabbing historical elements pell-mell without being very faithful to history. I care not if I represent more improprieties than there are motes in the sun. That is, this is the straight line from the spectators to the show as they look at it, and I’m relating that to the straight line in the story that Don Quixote refers to when he admonishes the boy. The narrator goes through “curves and transversals,” as Don Quixote calls them, to achieve the illusion of simultaneous action taking place, and to hold the spectators attention and approval in the same way that the theater has to abuse the rules of geometry to stage the action — abuses the rules of geometry to stage the action in what is presumably a greater territory, but it is compressed on the stage, and the proportion between the various elements, the various — the actors and the horses and all of that, are not followed. As he had already done in the galley slaves episode in Part I, to not overlook that Cervantes was also maimed, like Ginés is cross-eyed and Cervantes, as you remember, had a lesion on his left arm that he couldn’t use. His reading of literary tradition is also askew, like the tilt of his head."
1000,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-18,"The fact that the second part of the  is the first political novel is manifested in several ways. The second part adds (taken from the picaresque novel) geographic concreteness to its realistic portrayal of Spanish life and sociopolitical background to the novel: the episode of the boat shows the contrast between Don Quixote’s Ptolemaic obsolete notions of geography and the new Copernican conception of an infinite universe. The duke and duchess represent the Spanish idle upper classes in debt and kept financially afloat through loans, like the Spanish Crown. Don Quixote’s debate with the ecclesiastic is a critique of the Church, not of religion. The hunt in the wood was a reproduction of a leisure activity, a sport. The pageant in the forest is a baroque perversion of Dante’s  (XXVIII-XXX). Dulcinea as a transvestite seems to represent a burlesque manifestation of Don Quixote’s repressed inner desire.",": I said at the start of the last lecture that after the episodes that I will be discussing then, the cave of Montesinos and Master Peter’s puppet show, three significant new developments take place in the; I want to go over them again. The third is that Don Quixote and Sancho will be surrounded by many more characters than before. Now, I have given you a handout with the scene of Don Quixote’s exchange with Sancho on the issue of the distance they have traveled in — and as this exchange appears in various English translations, so that we can be amused by the efforts that the translators make to render it into English the puns that are involved, which are a little bit obscene in the Spanish, if you have your handout, if not, I have copies. ’”I think I explained in the last class the ugly word in Spanish to say to urinate is “,” equivalent in English of “to piss,” and, of course, in the word, in Ptolemy, in Spanish, “Ptolomeo,” there seems to be included the first person singular of the indicative of the word “,” “,” this is what Sancho hears in Ptolomeo’s name; And “,” computation, of course, to him what he hears is “,” which is the masculine of “,” which is whore and it means homosexual. The point is that, of course, Cervantes is making fun of the whole Ptolemaic system, which by this time is obsolete, but Don Quixote, of course, is invoking it, as his authority to tell where it is that they’re going as they ride on the boat. In addition, and this is a detail that I hope you pick up when you get to this part, if you haven’t gotten there yet, the duke and duchess’s expensive pleasures are underwritten by the peasant whose son does not want to marry Dueña Rodriguez’s daughter, which is the reason why no pressure is put on him by his master. The significance of all of this, apart from its baroque character, is that Cervantes is speculating, as usual, about his own position vis-à-vis his own fiction, this fiction that seems to be always getting away from him, and this is what the presence of these internal authors, who are beset by these problems of distance and control, reveals, which is the same kind of situation in which Master Peter finds himself with his puppet theater with catastrophic results. So we have, again, another instance here of this social and political criticism that appears in the novel. Think of it as that, a telescope, and as you pull it out you are pulling things from within it, and that is the way that these episodes that I’m going to discuss now appear in Part II. In baseball, the metaphor is more — it’s baroque, actually, it’s that convoluted and distant. It doesn’t have to be a goat, of course, it can be a turkey, at Thanksgiving, and so forth, or it could be a pig in many celebrations, but it seems to be an atavistic need of the human race to have these scapegoats. The episode gathers elements of the cave of Montesinos and the wagon of the parliament of death; it is a kind of synthesis of both. Think about this, think about the difference between Beatrice and this Dulcinea. The day was soon spent, and night came on not so clear nor so calm as the season of the year, which was the midst of summer, required, but a kind of  [, this is what Jarvis is trying to get at], which contributed very much to help forward the duke and duchess’s design. The voices, “” horrible; the devil is sounding a “,” an outrageous horn. Now, but why lashes on his butt and not his back? But, of course, it is an allusion to Sancho’s being so dependent on his digestive system, as it were. And, of course, the debate has raged over the centuries as to whether it was written by Cervantes or not."
1001,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-19,"The developments of Part II of the  are based and measured against Part I. In the episode of the afflicted matron, the story about Countess Trifaldi, and Clavileño, we see these expansions (the presence of love and death, the black color, the monsters, the clashing elements, the cross-dressing, the grotesque, the inclusiveness) which reach the limits of representation, in consonance with baroque aesthetics. The increasing presence of Virgil and to the  seem to point out that Don Quixote’s task is somewhat equivalent to that of Aeneas, but Don Quixote’s pursuit is not to found Rome, but to conquer himself. In part one we learned to look for the story behind the story, now, with all the pranks and stories made up by the duke’s steward, we learn how a story is made.",": I learned over the weekend of the death of Claude Lévi-Strauss; I don’t know if you read it in the paper or if you know who Claude Lévi-Strauss was. Don Quixote cannot aspire to such a grand design, but Cervantes has given him a different, no less serious one, and one that is consonant with the age in which he lives, which is no longer the heroic age of Virgil’s characters, and that design is to conquer himself. Modern fiction will expand on this device. Now, Sancho’s letter, if we want to also look for the antecedent in Part I, is an echo of the one Don Quixote wrote to Dulcinea and that Sancho, of course, forgot to take with him and then memorized, and we have all of those funny episodes in which he tries to retell it. He is as versatile as Ginés de Pasamonte, and even more. Thus he came, with the state and appearance aforesaid, and kneeled down before the duke, who, with the rest, received him standing. The monstrous spectre did so, and, as soon as he was upon his feet, he lifted up his veil, and exposed to view the horridest, the longest, whitest and best furnished beard, that human eyes until then had ever beheld; and straight he sent forth is broad and ample breast, a voice grave and sonorous; and, fixing his eyes on the duke, he said…”Of course, notice the preponderance of black, and notice that, as in the pageant in the forest, there are many superlatives. Their mock affliction seems to be an excess of testosterone that provokes a wild growth of facial hair. They are a bit like the , the female counterpart of the , but they cannot quite go out and start a career out at sea, or the church, so they are involved in providing or facilitating sexual encounters; they’re go-betweens, they tend to be go-betweens, as happens in the story concocted by the steward. The name of the seduced young woman is Antonomasia. Remember the etymology I gave you when discussing the cave of Montesinos episode, “” in Greek, “flesh,” and “,” “to eat,” so the sarcophagus eats the flesh of the dead body. Sarcophagi were common among the ancient Greeks and Romans, you have some here. Here the ensemble could allude to lust, the croc eats the monkey, as it were, but both animals are, the monkey and the crocodile, are supposed to be demonic and symbols of dissimulation, of fakery. What I mean by that is that there is something grotesque about the go between, the older woman falling in love with the young man, and that the same kind of grotesqueness is involved in the pregnancy. And this is, I think, the effect here of the pregnancy. It was a way of delving into their psychology. if so, I swear I think the world is the same everywhere. ”Sancho thinks that the world is the same everywhere, and this I what the view from above suggests. Appropriately giving his increasing importance, it is now Sancho who tells the story like the one Don Quixote told after emerging from the cave. I think this sums up, it seems to me, Cervantes’ attitude towards the protagonist."
1002,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-1,"The professor introduces himself and the course. He starts by explaining the reasons why  is a masterpiece and its place and relevance in the history of Western literature. He then comments on the proper pronunciation of the word “Quixote” and the reasons for the mispronunciations in French and English. A full explanation of the real title of the work () follows, along with some key clarifications about the language of the book and a few basic notes on historical and cultural background. González Echevarría then moves on to the present, commenting on ’s legacy in the Western world, proved by the use of words such as “quixotic,” and the success of its myth up to the present. He finishes his lecture by going back to its beginning, referring to the reasons for the endurance of this work, which relies on its deep questioning of the human self. The session ends with an overview of the syllabus.",": So this is the course on Cervantes’ Don Quixote. You will be getting tidbits about Spanish culture such as the one I’ve just given you throughout the course, even if this is not a culture class or a language class, but it is important for you to know them. Don Quixote’s serene passing reflects this understanding. Well, first of all, the, if it is a novel, is two novels. One published in 1605 and the other in 1615. Now, be careful also with the translations of titles. All right, so let us go over those words one by one. Now, the ‘–’ ending, O-T-E, suffix is a suffix that in Spanish always refers to something base or grotesque and sounds it: ‘,’ from ‘’ is a fatso; ‘’ from ‘’ is a hulking big guy, a lummox; ‘’ from ‘,’ is an ugly cuss, so ‘,’ then, was meant to sound abasing and ridiculous, particularly when paired with ‘,’ with which it forms a kind of oxymoronic pair, ‘.’ ‘’ This is a novel that is very rooted in a given geography. Now, what about the language of the, what language did Cervantes write? You will find as you read the book that the characters move through areas that are really depopulated, and this reflects this demographic reality. In poetry, the sixteenth century saw Garcilaso de la Vega, a name you will see in the book many times, and his many followers, the late great blossoming of the Petrarchan tradition, you know Petrarch, and the development from that Petrarchan tradition of a powerful strain of mystical poetry, particularly in the verse of St. John of the Cross. So the sixteenth century and seventeenth centuries are what are called in Spanish literary history as the Golden Age. But they were there for eight centuries, and one could say that the Arabic component in the broader sense is the main difference between Spain and the rest of Europe. Now, you can also glean from what I have said that the was translated very early into other European languages which, as already mentioned, 1611 for the English and it went on to be translated in France and so forth. This new, however, simpler arrangement together with the motif of bad literature influencing life constitutes a primal and influential glory for Cervantes. This is at the core of the book, at the core of much of the humor in the book; this idea of the various perspectives. The syllabus, as you know, is on the website. I will give you the topics of the paper for which you can devise your own particular topic but so you don’t have to begin: ‘the, the novel written by Miguel de Cervantes…’ No, you’re writing for me. You can buy both if you want to play around with them. I’m not happy with any of the translations. Because I know it’s very complicated so I’m giving you some time."
1003,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-20,"According to González Echevarría, Don Quixote’s epic task within the novel is to control his madness by accepting the vanity of his dreams and the futility of his quest. The protagonist’s change started with Sancho’s enchantment of Dulcinea, and peaked in the cave of Montesinos. Now, he displays his deepened wisdom in the counsel to his squire on how to govern the island of Barataria. The good government of Sancho, together with the fact that the cleverest character in the second part is the steward, reflects a crumbling society: Barataria is related to the breakdown of aristocratic authority and the emergence of the common man as potential ruler. The island, too, like a mock Utopia, is a laboratory of fiction making, in which the steward, who is the author, ironically gets trapped. In a very baroque like inversion, Sancho and Don Quixote endure all the pranks from the duke and duchess with their dignity untouched, proving that the mockers are the ones finally mocked.",": What is the significance of the real date on Sancho’s letter, one wonders? Literature is made of specific concrete details, not of abstractions, like philosophy, and this is why it is important to remember, to notice details, and to base your interpretations on the details. This, I think, is what the novel shows as the hero begins his return home, and this is why I’m asking you to try to finish it. It is cheap then also in the sense that the island is not real. He doesn’t know exactly — he doesn’t know at all what it means, but this is what it means, “.”Now, let us begin by pointing out the sources of the steward’s invention, the practice of making someone king for a day was common in carnival celebrations throughout Europe since the Middle Ages, and further back to saturnalias. The Inquisition and Spanish law had classified fornication. Now, then he has to — he is presented with a very complicated case about Clara Perlerina, “,” clear, “Perlerina” derived from “pearl,” “clear pearl”; she’s quite a pearl. I say nothing of her lips…’”And so on… Sancho sees through all of this, as something made up, and refuses to grant this, but this is a very interesting figure, because, I have mentioned in the last class, the figure of the monster who’s made up of contrasting features, of opposing features. But every day produces new things; jests turn into earnest, and jokers are joked upon. Sancho became a good governor; this is this the ironic result, a counter intuitive resolution that thwarts the designs of the duke and duchess and that undermines the authorial intentions of the steward who obviously wanted Sancho to provide the humor by acting stupid, and this is, in part, and this is something that I have not mentioned before, but that is easy to figure out, these are misreadings of Part I, on the part of characters in Part II. The concept goes back, of course, to Plato’s , and to all of the treatises that begin to appear in the Renaissance about the art of government, including, of course, Machiavelli’s , that I have mentioned several times here.is also in the background here, because Sancho is trying to act like the perfect prince, like the perfect ruler, and hence Machiavelli’s  is in the background of this episode. So see how many important Renaissance thinkers are behind in this episode. So, if you can see, the depth of this episode in the by dint of the many sources, ideas and books that it has behind it. To Freud, this is played out chiefly in the hilarious scene where Sancho is denied food. Actually, it is the punishment for their elevation, the revenge which their subjects take upon them. Now, Barataria is also like a laboratory experience on fiction, on fiction making."
1004,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-21,"Three issues related to the impending end of the novel define this lecture. The first one is improvisation, as we see it in the confluence of actual geography with current historical events: the expulsion of the , and the Turkish and Huguenots menaces. With the story of Ricote, a kind of  novel in a nutshell, Cervantes provides a smorgasbord of narrative possibilities, and presents the consequences that political decisions have on common people. The second issue is the international dimension that the novel acquires with the episode of Roque Guinard and the entrance in Barcelona. The third issue is the influence that art or literature has on reality: the prank organized by the duke and duchess makes possible the marriage of dueña Rodríguez’s daughter. Fiction, Cervantes seems to be suggesting, affects reality and improves it. Finally, Sancho’s fall into the pit, a parody of the episode of his master in the cave of Montesinos, makes the squire an equal to Don Quixote as the novel progresses.",": There are three issues that I want to bring up as I begin today’s lecture that will determine my general themes today: improvisation, the international dimension that the fiction of the novel acquires, and the influence of art or of literature on reality; those are the general topics. We have today, Elena Pellús and I, produced a slightly primitive map of Spain, but I think that it is clear enough to give you a notion of what I’m talking about. One could say that this story is a rewriting of the captive’s tale from Part I with Ricota, whose name is Ana Félix — I’ll be talking about this name in a minute — Ricota is the name given to his daughter; her name is Ana Félix. This accumulation of narratives is also a sort of closure by accumulation, one could say. Now, with Ricote, Cervantes passes judgment on a current event, one that is taking place as he writes the book. So this is a theoretical issue that, I’m sure, was in Cervantes’ mind, and if you remember, in Part I, the very last of the stories is also left unfinished. It is possible, and it has been mentioned, that he was also worried about himself, if he expressed an opinion obviously opposed to that of the crown. A fifth column is where you say about a group of individuals who are against a government but living within the state, within the nation. This is the drama that Ricote and his family is living through, and that Cervantes is mentioning here. So, so much for Ricote and Ana Felix for the time being. Now, we also noticed now, having abandoned McCurdy and Rodríguez, that this episode involves a , which makes Sancho even more reflective, and he no longer yearns for the island. Here, as with the actors in the wagon of death episode, Don Quixote makes no mistakes. But the point is that reality, here, appears to have turned into art; what he finds on the road are already representations of these saints, are artistic images of the saints. The second episode, which I find most charming, is when Don Quixote is caught in a net, in a green net that was set there among the trees to capture birds, by these young ladies playing at being shepherdesses, and getting ready to perform an eclogue by Garcilaso, that poet I have mentioned so man times in the semester, that I hope you remember his name — eclogue, these pastoral poems. Guinart is a kind of Catalan Robin Hood, who robs the rich and helps those in need. Is goodness possible within an outlaw society? Goodness always appears possible in Cervantes. Tragedies in the Golden Age Spanish literature tend to happen after marriage, and we don’t know if it is just another instance of Cervantes taking episodes from Part I, or even within Part II, and taking them one step further."
1005,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-22,"As we approach the end of the novel, Cervantes compresses and combines elements from different types of romances (, Greek, pastoral) in what seems to be an attempt to create a new literary genre; the modern novel. In the episodes in Barcelona, the prank with the talking head makes literal the figure of prosopopeia; Don Quixote’s visit to the printing shop explores the very origin of the book; the sign the boys hang on Don Quixote’s back also reduces him to language. Avellaneda’s misreading of the  coincides with that of the dueñas who punish Sancho, and is also ironically represented in Altisidora’s dream. By taking literature to its limits, by incorporating Avellaneda’s book into the Quixote, by rejecting bookish knowledge in favor of experience, Cervantes seems to point to the idea that there is no position from which to stand outside of the world of fiction. The only way out would be through a voluntary act of the will, equivalent to the one Don Quixote makes after being defeated by the Knight of the White Moon.",": To me, the most evocative moment in the, as we reach the beautiful city of Barcelona, is the appearance of the sea. We are not told if they had, but one, I think, should assume so. It is significant that, in contrast, to a history, I’ll repeat this, a history of the novel which is mainly urban, this is the only urban setting in , but it is urban with a vengeance, even with its party, its own party, which is a party very much something of the city, and I’m thinking here of  which is the last volume in Marcel Proust’s , which I hope you get to read some day, in which there are many parties in that novel, and dances, and stuff. Remember that, to me, the most interesting aspect of this mini Byzantine romance is when Gaspar Gregorio is dressed as a woman so as to be less attractive to his Turkish captors. They bespeak of a past that Cervantes chose not to fill out. We are not given any details about this past of Don Quixote; we could imagine it. I mean, here, these bored  have parties, and suddenly a literary character emerges among them; it is a godsend to them. It is a visit to the origin of all reflections and representations. Later, he will borrow a character from the false  and make him swear that he had never seen him and Sancho, seen Don Quixote and Sancho. The play of illusion, the blurring of the border between fantasy and fiction is emphasized by these various layers of fiction involved, and by the brilliant move by which Cervantes, by not allowing Don Quixote to go to Saragossa, intends to correct history, but, of course, it’s a history that is a fiction. Avellaneda’s  presents a character that is essentially ridiculous and funny, and a Sancho who is a glutton and a drunk, so it is the vision of the as essentially a funny book, a misreading that has been repeated in recent times by the so called “hard school” of critics of Cervantes in England, that I said that the only hard thing about it is the hardening of the critical arteries: Peter Russell and company, Anthony Close… In a way, Cervantes preempts all of them by doing what he does with Avellaneda’s , but the misreading is interesting in itself. This is what is profound about this scene. This is a description of this Arcadia, of the pastoral. Cervantes inserts here a statement by Cide Hamete to underline the questionable state of mind of these frivolous aristocrats. The famous deaths are of those Beatrice ; these are three ladies. Sancho’s body, is again, the object, or better, the vehicle for expiation, and the  are his executioners; that is, they are going to slap him around and pinch him, and stick pins in his butt, and so forth, and this is what will allow Altisidora to be revived. It seems that Sancho has been cast in the role of the fool who must suffer all of the physical shenanigans, meaning the fool drawn from the carnival tradition."
1006,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-23,"González Echevarría focuses on the end of the . He starts referring to Cervantes’ humor, which allows us to see humanity in contrast to the mad hero and thus appreciate everyone’s folly. The novel’s plot, with Don Quixote’s repeated returns home, suggests that life consists of going and coming back, and this is probably why we approach the end by returning to the beginning. In his last return home Don Quixote has conquered himself. By accepting his defeat by the Knight of the White Moon, who is a reflection of himself, he accepts himself for what he is. In the process of returning, Cervantes has underlined that reality has become fictionalized in Part II independently of Don Quixote. Cervantes is aware that his hero, as we see in Sancho’s comments at the last inn, belongs to the great fictions of the ages. The closes in three ways, corresponding to a three-part conception of the worlds in which Don Quixote lives: Don Quixote is defeated; he regains his sanity; and he dies. Death is necessary in the novel, as it is a form of closure that everyone understands. A reference to Unamuno’s, Borges’ and Picasso’s visions of Don Quixote ends this lecture.",": As we approach the end of the semester we also, naturally, approach the end of the, and we move on to the consideration of other works of his, as well as reactions to his works by two major writers, Kafka and Borges. Sancho’s wisdom is another measure by which to judge other characters, presumably better educated. Cervantes is, of course, again, poking fun at Avellaneda, but the way he does is full of other suggestions, as I mentioned in a previous class, and I referred to the work by Stephen Gilman. This is enormously funny at a very sophisticated level. Remember that I mentioned several times, the picaresque begins as a deposition, a legal document of a criminal addressing a judge, and so this is not the end of Avellaneda, because, as you remember, after Don Quixote regains his sanity, he asks to be forgiven by Avellaneda for having induced him, enticed him to write such a bad book. He observed, in the two history-pieces, that Helen went away with no very ill will, for she was slyly laughing to herself; but the beauteous Dido seemed to let fall from her eyes tears as big as walnuts. Such has been the identification of the with Spain. By this fiction we humanize it, making it talk our language. The prophetic would extend that world for closing and ending. It is as if Cervantes himself were, here, wavering about how to end the novel. Third, Don Quixote dies, and presumably reaches the true reality, that is, the afterlife. This makes the entire series of episodes that make up the whole book his madness like a bubble, or a dream all the more so. There is no total closure in the possible. I think Cervantes plays with it ironically; he knows that no matter how may times he says Don Quixote is dead, and that Cide Hamete is hanging his pen and addressing his pen, that any writer can still come up as Juan Montalvo did — I think I may have mentioned him before — an Ecuatorian writer, who wrote a wonderful book called ; and it’s a , meaning it’s imitating Cervantes’s style. One answer would be to say that only by making him die can Cervantes blur the distinction between our daily lives and the invented lives of literature, both have endings with significance. So Don Quixote’s death as Don Quixote and his rebirth as Alonso Quijano is not enough to close the book; he also had to die, but only if the theme of the book is, and I believe that it is, the unreality of worldly life, and our hope for a real life after death. She and Sancho keep alive, according to Unamuno, the religion of Don Quixote, which is on the wane in Spain, as he writes his book in 1905. So the Spanish fleet came out, and it was a turkey shoot. Cervera was later sued by the Spanish government for losing the fleet; so that was a quixotic moment of the kind Unamuno would have applauded. The windmills in the background are Don Quixote’s signature, and the bright sun beating down on him is Castile’s hot sun, which is present through much of the novel, but what is not so evident, it seems to me, until you look for a while, is that Don Quixote’s figure is like an interrogation mark; the figure of Don Quixote is like an interrogation mark, a question mark, in English, I’m sorry, I’m translating from Spanish, “,” question mark."
1007,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-24,"Would have Cervantes deserved such recognition, had he not written the ? The answer is no. However, he would probably be remembered for some of his other works. Two of , significantly connected together, are commented in this lecture. “The Deceitful Marriage” deconstructs marriage both as a social institution and as a narrative tool: Cervantes manipulates literary conventions by beginning with what is normally the end of a story, a marriage, and works backwards to undue a union that never took place legitimately. In “The Dogs Colloquy” we skirt the supernatural idea that dogs can talk. The story is a picaresque autobiography in which the  pretends to be a dog. Perhaps Scipio’s life, not told here, could have been another Quixote. The author of a story, it is suggested, does not control the text while it is being read. A short comment on Kafka’s parable “The Truth about Sancho Panza” and Borges’ story  precede the end of this last lecture that refers to Cervantes’ death. Drawing a parallel between Cervantes’ death and that of Don Quixote and Alonso Quijano, González Echevarría reads the dedication to  and Cervantes’, and also his own, farewell to this course.",": Miguel de Cervantes died in Madrid on April 23rd, 1616. Part II of the appeared in 1615, and also, in that year, his volume of theater, called . Let me repeat a quotation from the , specifically from the biographical essay by Manual Durán that opens the . A writer cannot hope for a greater source of consolation. ”Later, constructions and reconstructions of that building by the way led to the disappearance of Cervantes bones. The answer has to be no, the answer has to be no; not by far, though. It’s very funny that way; it has moments like that. This is why you cannot just list authors; you have works, you have to list works, when you are making a hit parade like the one Harold Bloom makes in .So the high point of Cervantes’ production other than the was , or , as they’re called in the translation that you are using. This is a terminological problem that I have explained before. On the contrary, he or she, because there are feminine picaresques, and we’re going to be talking about one today, is a minor criminal in trouble with the law, and, in fact, the center conceit of novels like  and  is that the text is a confession or deposition addressed by the accused delinquent to a figure in authority. That is, sociology and criminology find their source in these kinds of novels, these kinds of picaresque novels that depict the lower strata of society in great detail. The story begins with a marriage, virtually, that is, it begins where stories normally end, and works backwards, to undue a union that never took place legitimately; it is a marriage into which they enter presumably without pretense or illusions. As we have seen, and I have said many times, perhaps too many times throughout the semester, and it’s not a warning to you, everything that happens before marriage is the stuff of comedy in Cervantes, everything that happens after marriage is the stuff of tragedy. It is in the house that they spend a brief period of matrimonial bliss. This is why I find it such a disturbing story. Historically, there were two Scipios, the one who took and destroyed Carthage, and his son, who destroyed the Spanish town of Numancia, an event on which Cervantes based perhaps his most successful play. He wants to live in an ambiguous state, the origin of his literary creation. I think that this brief text, it’s just a paragraph shows to what extent Kafka, I think, connected with the core of Cervantes’ literary imagination, with Cervantes’ notion and feel for literary creativity. Tornéle a abrazar, volvióseme a ofrecer, picó a su burra, y dejóme tan mal dispuesto como él iba caballero en su burra, a quien había dado gran ocasión a mi pluma para escribir donaires; pero no son todos los tiempos unos: tiempo vendrá, quizá, donde, anudando este roto hilo, diga lo que aquí me falta, y lo que sé convenía. To this, one of my companions replied, ‘It’s the fault of Señor Miguel de Cervantes’ nag, which is somewhat long-stepping.’ ”Here we find the same Cervantes of the prologues. Two, here, as so many times in the, we have another student, with hilarious details about his clothing. Students are seekers of knowledge, readers which are of great interest to Cervantes, as we all know."
1008,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-2,"Why does the  have such common currency today? González Echevarría believes that the  is about the effect that literature has on its readers and about the creation of literature. Its story does not belong to any previous tradition but it is a new story, and this act of invention by a fifty-year old man, Cervantes, is in itself part of modern literature. González Echevarría comments on why the creation of this work was possible in the Spain of the seventeenth century and, after making some important distinctions between the concepts novel and romance, chivalric romances and courtly romance, explains that the  is the first novel because it portrays the clash between the protagonist and his setting for the first time. He then talks about the ’s precursors in the picaresque novel and the beginnings of realism. The lecture ends with a thorough commentary on the prologue, its intentions and meanings, along with the concepts of authorship, the legitimation of literature, and ultimately, self invention.",": I want to begin by taking up some general questions concerning the matters, such as the difference between romance and novel, because I know from the last lecture that you must have been confused, and it’s good to know it. The one that I assume general readers will understand about wanting to be other and so forth, that I spoke about in the last class. Don Quixote goes mad ‘cause he reads too much literature. It is full of what we call factoids, things that are almost true but not quite we call factoids derisively, of course. Yet, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Spain produced Cervantes, Velázquez, the character of Don Juan, the picaresque, all figures authors or kinds of writing that are at the core of the modern western tradition. ”Now, etymologies are fun, but they don’t always clarify what a word means in the present, and, in fact, sometimes the etymologies work against such a clarification. It helps you be pedantic if you tell somebody, or if you bring it up in that party that I always mention here, at which a Yalie can be pedantic by saying, “Candid derives from  in Latin which means white,” or, “That is a very Kafkaesque story that you’ve told me.” They are easy to follow and their moral is clear. The horse was part of the knight’s identity; hence, the whole business about naming his horse at the beginning of the — now you understand that. I’m talking about the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Now, this development of the printing press had a decisive impact on literature because it increased dissemination, on the and the novel, in general, owe their existence to this invention. The night was involved in the most extraordinary adventures against fantastic and frightening wrongdoers; his passionate love for an idealized lady dominated his thoughts. The is a very free adaptation of novels from the Breton cycle; but is a complex network of the most varied and marvelous adventures. But the was much more fun to read, and therefore it surpassed Castiglione’s book as a source of models for deportment for people in the courts. This is so you can see the genealogy within the Spanish tradition. Now, you will see that this is a cliché about Spanish literature of the Golden Age, sixteenth and seventeenth century, what will prevail is a clash between this realistic conception or vision of the world and the idealistic conception that comes through the neo-Platonic tradition and that is, let us say, embodied in . But we soon see that what Cervantes means by entertainment does not preclude consideration of very thorny ethical issues that involve reading and literature in general, these issues emerge immediately in the prologue. I mean Montaigne is still very relevant and speaks to the modern mind. Of course, Shakespeare had read Montaigne. It’s as if I wrote a book and I had a blurb from James Bond to continue with our fictional characters. He is not going outside of fiction and outside of literature for legitimation, but he’s using these literary characters to be those who praise the book. Cervantes has created a hero who is beyond Freud’s family romance. Celestina, but she had as co-protagonists the two young lovers. Because his self invention is an act of will based on nothing."
1009,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-3,"González Echevarría continues from the end of his last lecture by referring to the self invention and self legitimation of Don Quixote, which is the most innovative aspect of the book. The main character is, as it is suggested in the famous first sentence of the book, beyond family and social determinisms, hence literature appears as a realm for wit and a capacity for invention, breaking with the previous literary tradition and with its predecessors. Perspectivism is expressed in the novel through various linguistic fluctuations, regional differences, and spaces such as the inn, which becomes a key place in the novel by providing an archaeology of society. The first episodes of the , from the first sally to the first adventure with Sancho, show the gap between literature and reality by probing into Don Quixote’s very particular madness which refuses to recognize and accept social conventions. Cervantes’ literary techniques, such as dialogue, and the presence of his squire blur the differences between fiction and reality, and ultimately question our beliefs and view of the world.",": Let me begin by repeating my last point in last Tuesday’s lecture. Remember, the Lukács quote about the being the first story of a world that has been abandoned by God. It is a non-place, although many towns in Spain claim to be the town in which Don Quixote was born. If language is so shifty, how can we express the truth in language? So it is clear because it is a hot day and it is the month of July that this is a hot Friday in July. Not the which derived from the picaresque a pension for the particular in everything. Here is another level at which  is going to provide amusement. This is a very important part of Cervantes’ achievement that is lost in the translation, but that the English reader can gage, that is, the differentiation between the characters or among the characters by the way they speak. You can gage it by thinking of a novel that was very much influenced by Cervantes, . Speech marks the characters by providing their social station and even region of origin — We will see that in a minute — I read  as a child in Spanish and, of course, they didn’t translate into the Spanish the dialect differences between Jim and Huck and so forth. This is what Cervantes achieves through this very interesting character. Because in his madness he refuses to abide, to recognize and to accept social conventions. And that way he highlights the arbitrariness of such conventions. So Seville was a teaming port and ports are always full of corruption, and the like, because of all of the exchange of goods and the various peoples who are there. That is Jews, who have been forced to convert. This is the ultimate insult and humiliation, to be beaten by a commoner after having been betrayed by Rocinante. Again, it is conjecture that the end of the library episode would have been the end of the novella of , if indeed, what Cervantes proposed to write was a long short story about this man who goes mad from reading too much, etcetera. Here the Inquisition is represented by the niece who’s nineteen years old, the housekeeper, a village priest, a barber, I mean, these are not exactly high intellects, and the inquisition’s officers were… So, this is a satire in Cervantes, even against menacing institutions like the Inquisition, is always mild. It’s not impossible, but very improbable. He will think of becoming a shepherd too. You see how much Cervantes can suggest without saying it directly?Now, a more significant contradiction is that while the library is walled off and the books burned, the characters continue to speak to Don Quixote from within the fictions of chivalry. I think that a farmer in English would be called Wilbur. I would imagine someone being called Wilbur, I don’t know why, but that’s why I imagine — Sancho is a very, very common name, it gives us — Chalk always eludes me — it gives us the last name ‘’ in Spanish, that many of you have heard, I’m sure. ‘.’ It refers to his eating habits and to his being very much in touch with matter, with the earth. Now, of course, he represents common sense in contrast to Don Quixote’s flights of fancy and I mean common sense, a sense of the common people. And the second sally is where the as we know it, really begins. These are people from the Basque country."
1010,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-4,"González Echevarría starts out by commenting on what he calls the two overarching plots of the : the story about the writing of the novel, and the story about the mad hidalgo. The first is based upon several levels of narratives that distance Cervantes from his own creation. He does so as the painter Diego Velázquez in  which shows multiple incomplete perspectives of the same work, portrays the work behind the scenes of creation, it includes the viewer in the painting as well as the author, as another character, not in a central position, but in an oblique one. With their techniques, both Cervantes and Velázquez present the limitations of human knowledge. The madness of Don Quijote is present in the two episodes that González Echevarría comments upon afterward. The episode with the goatherds connects the ideal world (inside the hidalgo’s mind) and the real world of the goatherds. Their human kindness becomes a human quality in the novel displayed by many regardless of social origin. The story of Marcela and Grisóstomo follows. Here Cervantes portrays their socio-economic world while at the same time he defends their free will above everything else.",": As I said in my last lecture, and as you have already — I’m sure — seen, the has two overarching plots. The one about the insane Don Quixote will acquire coherence after the fight with the Biscainer, as Jarvis calls it in your translation, because he and his squire will now be pursued by the Holy Brotherhood — I’ll explain what the Holy Brotherhood is — and by the priest and the barber. This manuscript of this novel was found in a vault somewhere, it was written by some sage, and so forth, and Cervantes is parodying that. Yes, we have the first one, the second one, the third one; it all remains vague and a mystery, and besides, we know that the whole thing is a joke beginning with the name Cide Hamete Benengeli or . Now, it is as if Cervantes were removing the origin of the text, were leaving it in a sort of cloud of mystery, and that this is part both of the irony and of the joke. Can we improve a little bit on the quality of that? So I have brought both my pointer and, if you will excuse me, this little flashlight so I can look at my notes. Now,  seems to capture a moment, and not a very significant moment, and that is significant in itself. The princess is being offered, I think, a glass of water of something by this maid, and this man in the back is about to leave the room, so it’s an insignificant moment, it’s a moment like those in the, those many moments that are contingent, serendipitous, things just happened, not in a sequence, but just caught, like a snapshot, and that is what is important about this moment in which Velázquez and all of these other people in the painting are caught up. In fact, the first time I saw this painting many years ago in 1969 to be exact — now it’s in a large room and you can barely get to see the painting there are so many tourists looking at it and guides talking about it and so forth — but when I saw it in 1969 at El Prado Museum it was in a room — the painting is much larger than what you see here — it was in a room for itself, and the dimensions of the room and the way that the painting was positioned the moment you walked in, you walked into the painting, you became the model. So, ironically, it is that man who is at that point who has the most complete view. So we move now to the adventure with the goat herds and the speech on the golden age, that is one of the more famous episodes of Part I. Now, this is an episode like others, in which a contrast is established between what Don Quixote has in his head from having read so many books and the real world around him. The one thing that connects the two — and it goes back to one of the points that I’ve made before — is the goatherds’ kindness. And remember that I said that Cervantes likes to depict people from the lowest classes being kind to each other and to Don Quixote. We learn that because his poem is read at the funeral, a typical Petrarchan . So I think that this is the end of the Marcela and Grisóstomo episode."
1011,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-5,"After pointing out the prosaic world depicted in the  with subtle but sharp irony, González Echevarría analyzes the episode at Juan Palomeque’s inn, which may well be seen as a representation of the whole first part of the novel. The episodes at the inn are an instance of the social being subverted by erotic desire and they show the subconscious of literature. Then follows a commentary on the characters that appear in the episode, all drawn from the picaresque and the juridical documents of the period, and many of whom are marked by a physical defect that makes them unique and yet attractive, even if ugly. Don Quixote’s and Sancho’s bodily evacuations dramatize the violent forces behind their basic drives to live; the ramshackle improvised architecture of the inn symbolizes the apparently improvised design of the novel, yet, like the inn, it has cosmic connections.","Now, let us begin today with just some general issues that I think are very pertinent to the reading of the. The prose, it is because it is the prose of the world, of everyday life. Hence the novel, from now on, will be written in prose, with exceptions. And the last general issue that I’d like to bring up is, again, the issue of irony. The inn is in a kind of a  — I’m sure you’ve heard this word, but I guess I’m determined to teach a lot of very pedantic words that you can use in further life, even if you become a lawyer or something, ‘’ in Italian means ‘bright dark’; it’s a combination of darkness and brightness, and it’s normally associated with Baroque art. The point seems to be that even the rather concrete reality, tangible reality of the inn can be transformed by the characters needs, desires, and imaginings, because this inn is as far as possible from a castle and the characters as far as possible from those in the romances of chivalry. ”This episode is the most explicit erotic display by Don Quixote in the entire book, erotic in a sense of explicit sexuality, is the most explicit in the whole book. Remember, I told you to look for details. She takes pride in being reliable in her professional dealings as a whore. Now, going down the list of these characters — and I’m doing this as this had been a play, because, as I said, the inn is very much like a stage — there is an officer from the ancient Holy Brotherhood of Toledo, who represents the law, and he’s the one who hits Don Quixote on the head with a candleholder, and I explained in the last class what the Holy Brotherhood is, or was at the time, and it plays an important role, because it is the police force that is pursuing Don Quixote and Sancho. Each, however, is mental or cerebral or physical, in a particular way. Her defective eyes had a touch of grotesqueness, but also signals limitations in perception that are at the core of what happens at the inn in the dark, when they can’t see each other very well. Her hairs, not unlike those of a horse’s mane, he took for threads of the brightest gold of Arabia, whose splendour obscures that of the sun itself. Spanish literature is full of situations in which a lustful aristocrat tries to ravage a peasant woman; all of European literature is full of this. This suggests that the inn was originally a small house to which additions were made haphazardly, incorporating the stable and it’s hayloft to its living quarters to accommodate more paying guests. After twelve chapters, we started worrying about the lost of recovered donkey, here reappears gradually. The writing in these added passages reads very much like Cervantes’s prose to me, though not to other scholars, who think that this is somebody else writing, so editors have incorporated them into the final version of the model. This is new for a fiction, that their relationship transcends the social differences between them and becomes profound and complicated because of these spats that they occasionally have. The first is the battle with the herds of sheep — that I hope you found as hilarious as I always do when I reread it. Wool was a very important product of Castile, as you have read in the Elliott, and, of course, this sheep at the distance could look like an army. These are the scars of time on his body that I have mentioned before. And I want to ponder about this little episode."
1012,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-6,"Important meditations about the nature of literature and the real take place in the chapters commented on in this lecture. Reality appears strange enough even to Don Quixote in the episode of the corpse, where death becomes a presence. Don Quixote appears aware that his adventures are being written as we read them. His relationship with his squire is further developed in the episode of the fulling hammers. Mambrino’s helmet exemplifies the modern radical doubt about the power of the senses to grasp reality, while the episode of the galley slaves represents a satire of autobiographical writing. Cervantes portrays a society that the sixteenth-century reader recognized as his own, in which Ginés de Pasamonte, a low-class slippery criminal and author, represents the new generation of writers who break with the strictures of Renaissance mimesis. The descent in social status of the author, Ginés, appears to be accompanied by an increase in inventiveness and a rise in the importance of the author. This episode is a meditation on the creation of new genres, such as the picturesque, not derived from the classics but from experience, as well as on the topic of perspectivism.",": I’m going to begin by going over briefly the episodes that I didn’t get to cover in the last lecture because we ran out of time. The episode of the merchants of Toledo, for instance, is one that comes to mind. Now, in addition, in this episode death becomes a presence in the novel. And here I want to bring in two lines from a poem by Wallace Stevens, the great American poet, about whom you will hear a little more in today’s lecture. This is something new that, in a way, Cervantes really invented. Now, we have spoken about Maritornes, who is a prostitute, but there are others, like for instance, the servant who beats up Don Quixote in the episode about the merchants of Toledo, the rowdies, who toss Sancho in the blanket, Andrés, who’s being beaten by his master but who seems to be a pícaro himself, the first innkeeper, who was, I’ve called him, a retired pícaro, and the prostitutes at the first inn. Now, let me anticipate some ideas and redirect others that I have already mentioned before to give a context to what I’m going to be saying. The wild man is an individual lost in the woods or in some cave, who lives in a state of nature, away from civilization. The clash between the two is at the core of Don Quixote, of course, but the point is that except in his imagination Don Quixote never inhabits a world other than that of Spain in the late sixteenth century among people involved in ordinary activities who do not violate the laws of nature. A barber’s basin is this device that the barber would use, and it has an indentation like that to put it under the person’s chin, and for the neck, and then to wash the beard and the water to fall in it, and so I wanted you to have it, a depiction of that, so that you will know what we are talking about here. But there are attenuating circumstances where Don Quixote’s error reality contingency — when I say contingency I mean accidents — conspire to confuse him, as in the case of the dead body."
1013,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-7,"Professor González Echevarría resumes his commentary on the galley slaves episode by talking about Ginés’ cross-eyedness as a metaphor for congenital internal perspectivism. This is a new model of conflictive being, capable of seeing simultaneously in two ways. The character among the galley slaves that he calls “the prisoner of sex” follows. Professor González Echevarría shows how Cervantes can create a complex character in just one paragraph while portraying the historical and legal background of Cervantes’ time. The Sierra Morena episodes, the core of part one of the , take the second half of the lecture. They consist of a set of narrative strands tightly woven around two of the principal drives in the book: Don Quixote’s love quest for Dulcinea, and the series of crimes and misdemeanors perpetrated by the hidalgo and his squire. All the interpolated stories have common elements with the central plot, with the Marcela and Grisóstomo interlude, and with each other: the perpetration of offenses due to passion, honor, body and property, and with the resulting need for restitution, recompense, requital, pardon or revenge. In all of them, marriage looms as the inevitable and most appropriate form of reparation as well as the most effective kind of narrative closure.","We’re going to begin today by going to the end of my previous lecture and taking up, again, the topic of Ginés being cross-eyed, to give you my final thoughts on that. But being cross-eyed means that within each individual there are conflicting views and therefore, conflicting ways of seeing, and this is very much inline with the way that Cervantes’ characters behave, at odds with themselves, often. This condition Cervantes represents, as is usual with him, in a very funny way. They were cousins, brothers and sisters, and so forth and so on, as you can imagine. So the same symbolic topology reappears, that we have seen already between the road and the inn, now, here, it is between the woods and the inn, between the inn and the wilderness, which will be also a good way to translate , the wilderness. And the going back and forth from one to the other is punctuated, often, by interruptions in the narratives, interruptions that we will consider carefully later today. These are things that are seen very, very far from our lives today, but not at the time. What we learn from Don Quixote’s passion for Aldonza, whom he turns into Dulcinea, is that when in love we invent the object of our desire, and that that object depends on the projection of our own inner demons. And as you may have noticed, Sancho is not very interested in discovering who the owner of the bag is, because he doesn’t want to have to return the money. She is the rich farmer’s daughter, and she’s far below Don Fernando’s status, and marrying her would anger Don Fernando’s father because she is his vassal. Now, to explain Don Fernando’s socioeconomic status, I must expound a little bit on a Spanish institution, the , which is that word I have here. By the middle of the twelfth century, the king allowed the establishment of  that comprised entire villages. These possessed no title of their own, and were generally victims of the  system which reserved the bulk of the family wealth to their elder brothers. So restitution takes on a whole new meaning when viewed from this perspective. The economic, social and ultimately judicial context that was the background of the Marcela-Grisóstomo episode is greatly expanded then here, to encompass deep social and economic issues in Castile during the sixteenth century. The source of the conflict in which Don Fernando, Cardenio, Luscinda and Dorotea are entangled is very precise. So this is what is behind the legal, socioeconomic background of these stories, about which we will talk more. In chapter VIII, when the narrator claims to have run out of text — so that is perhaps the most famous interruption in western literature — but there have been many other interruptions; the story of Marcela and Grisóstomo being told by Vivaldo, and Ambrosio, and others, is interrupted several times, but the most — and also we have the proleptic interruption — very funny interruption of Sancho telling his story about Torralba and her boyfriend and the goats having to cross the river and all of that — remember that interruption?But here, we have other interruptions. So he has transformed that story in his fantasy into that paranoid fantasy, that what it reveals truly what is in his subconscious."
1014,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-8,"In this part of the , Cervantes makes a boast of narrative mastery by combining the sequential structure of the chivalric romance with the multiple story design of collections of novellas. The stories invented by the characters, who create meta-characters, lead to the revelation of other stories not being told, or being told obliquely. The relation among all the stories, including the main plot, is predicated on cuts and crisscrossing made possible by traumatic interruptions, which jostle the memory of the tellers and drive them to reveal other stories behind the one they tell, and making them disclose their inner thoughts. Memory is in all cases the key element a repository of recollections from the past and the structuring force of the self in the present. The whole network of stories, itself a superb display of narrative skill and variety, is one of the aims of Renaissance art, announced by the scene in which Dorotea is ogled (in parts) by other characters. As González Echevarría explains, the  leads us again to ask questions that are pertinent and relevant to our lives. Is living the acting out of roles? Are we characters in somebody else’s fiction, and if so, are we bound by ethics?",": We are coming to a part of the, the core of Part I, in which Cervantes makes a display of narrative mastery by combining the sequential structure of the chivalric romance, whose form he is parodying, with the multiple story design of collections of , the long short story favored by Italians from Boccaccio to Bandello. In the last class, we saw how interrupted stories being told by characters led to the revelation of other stories not being told or being told obliquely. It is not just what others did to him, but what he failed to do at the decisive moment, his cowardice, as he refers to it twice. It is like the scar left by a deep wound. Now, connected to all of this, and perhaps the overarching memory lapse of them all is the loss of Sancho’s ass or dapple, as the translation calls him — there’s no name, by the way, for the ass in the Spanish original, but I know that in this translation and the others they call him “dapple” because, I suppose, of his color — So remember that this theft of Sancho’s ass is left out of the first edition and Cervantes hastily restored it in the second printing, a few months later. The representation of all of this of this interplay of memory and narrative is the overall network of interrelated and intertwined stories that take place or are told in the Sierra Morena and resolved at Juan Palomeque’s inn, after Don Quixote’s battle of the wine skins, about which we will speak in the next class. In the last class I focused on Don Fernando — remember when I talked about the  and the  and that whole background. ”Dudley is referring to the episode that I quoted earlier about the meeting of Cardenio and Don Quixote, when the knight seems to remember having seen Cardenio earlier. Dudley goes on to give a context to the figure of the wild man. I mean, these figures assume the role of he-goats and of wolves, two images that suggest respectively the problems of sex and violence that haunted the seventeenth century; I would say that haunted all centuries, but I mean, he knows, because he has studied stories in the seventeenth century. ”And this is a typically Renaissance idea of a cure provoked by the contemplation of beauty. This is the role that Dorotea plays in the cure of Cardenio. Now, Dorotea’s story is as compelling as Cardenio’s, but she is more composed and determined to obtain some sort of restitution. For Cardenio, the crucial piece is the scene of the wedding of Luscinda and Don Fernando, which had appeared proleptically in the chivalric story that he blurted out, when Don Quixote interrupted him, the business about Queen Madasima and the surgeon having had an affair — remember that psychotic version that he had in his mind about the deflowering of Luscinda. This invocation of heaven means that, once rescued from the wilderness, the law, both human and divine will again take effect and their story will have a happy ending, once they have left that wild place of the Sierra Morena, law will again take effect, human and divine law. Sancho, remember, has left to fetch Don Quixote and Cardenio, the priest and the barber, discover the beautiful Dorotea in a shady spot, washing her feet in a brook. This background enhances the figure, it enhances the figure to have her be a version of a classical myth. Indirectly and humorously, the issue of mimesis is brought up here by Cervantes. But Micomicona, here, means that she is from the kingdom of monkeys, of a kingdom of representation, a kingdom of parodies. Some men have been in drag playing various roles, even Sancho is playing the role of the squire of a bogus knight-errant. This is where the leads us, again, to ask questions that are pertinent and relevant to our lives. Perhaps that creation is the flawed product of memory. What is the value of the sub-texts — if we could use that word — that we found beneath the stories being told, like the one about Dorotea’s predicament, and the one that Cardenio is a really telling?"
1015,spanish-and-portuguese,span-300,lecture-9,"The insertion of the Novel of the Curious Impertinent at the end of part one of the  may be explained by Cervantes’ intention of meshing both the forms of the chivalric romance and of the collection of Italian . The result, though awkward, leads to the creation of the modern novel. This short novel seems to have been included by Cervantes as a way to publishing it in the same way. Reading the novel out loud, with all the characters gathered connects with the old tradition of reading literature out loud. The irony, however, is that this perverse love story is heard in the voice of the priest. González Echevarría interprets the novel trough René Girard’s theory of love always mediated by a third person who also works as a motivator. The story gives a contrasting mirror of literature to the young people at the inn who are involved in love stories about to culminate in marriage. Don Quixote’s interruption of the reading allows the court-like scene of reconciliations among the various couples and all restitutions which were made, as a reaffirmation of new social forms. Cervantes’ point is that mental life is made up of levels that mirror and distort each other.",": I want you to ponder, over the next few days, what is commemorated on October 7, the next October 7, which will be next Wednesday. We are going to talk today mostly, but not exclusively, about , as you can anticipate by the various triangles on the board. You could say, is it padding, is Cervantes padding his novel, or does it have something to do with the intercalated stories that we have been discussing and that are about to be resolved?First, let us go over how Cervantes does justify the inclusion of the novel at the most elementary level. But here Cervantes seems to be emphasizing that the romances of chivalry do have a function in society; they furnish relaxation to the common people. So we must not take, I don’t think, Cervantes seriously when he says that he wrote the book simply to do away with the romances of chivalry — Remember, what I said before that by his time, essentially, the fashion of publishing them, anyway, had ended, but they continued to be read, at least, if we take the as evidence of their being read by the common people. In fact,  is actually drawn from Ariosto’s I have mentioned Ariosto several times, but I will mention him again now. And, in fact, Girard will claim that all novels contain, the kernel of all novels, is this kind of mimetic triangular desire, and his book contains analysis of famous novels in the European tradition like , , and so forth. When I was a graduate student this book was the rage, and everyone was interpreting his or her love relationships in terms of triangular desire. It is that presumed desire by the mediator that makes her or him attractive. Jealousy, in other words, is a requirement for desire, for love. That is, you love so much the mediator that you wind up loving the mediator, not loving the person that you thought you began loving. Comedies tend to end in marriage because marriage is a return to stability; and in theater comedy is a return to an order that has been upset, whereas tragedy does not return to order. She is lacking  — Dorotea — nobility, but  is passed on through the male line, not the female line, as we’ve mentioned here before. Luscinda, by the way, in the midst of all of this, had been kidnapped from a convent and brought to the inn in what turns out to be a side story not told in detail. So this is what Herrero writes, and it’s important because he’s bringing in first the Neo-Platonic notions of love derived from the courtly love tradition — that I think I’ve spoken about — against sort of certain movement in Spanish society and in sixteenth-century society, and philosophy in general, towards a more bourgeois sense of marriage — You remember, I think I’ve spoken about the courtly love tradition, the courtly love tradition, which is one of the great — how could I say? ”That’s the end of the quote, which I hope now you can understand given the background that I gave you about. Don Fernando is at one level Pandafilando de la Fosca Vista, a giant. The idea also seems to be that to cure the characters in the real world of the fiction where they live they also have to be cured in their dreams and inventions, which is one of the overall plot strands now being resolved in the, he’s the only one missing here. They too have left normal lives, as Sancho has, he left his wife and children, to engage in an insane quest after an insane man."
