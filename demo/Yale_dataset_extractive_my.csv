0,african-american-studies,afam-162,lecture-16,"In this lecture, Professor Holloway revisits Malcolm X’s life in order to offer a more nuanced interpretation of the black leader than is traditionally taught. Professor Holloway links Malcolm X to a tradition of black intellectuals and political activists like Booker T. Washington, Marcus Garvey, and Robert Williams, and he explores the philosophy of the Nation of Islam (NOI), the organization for which Malcolm X is the national spokesman before his split with Elijah Muhammad in 1964. In the final year of his life, prior to his assassination by NOI members in 1965, Malcolm X makes a religious journey to Mecca, rejects his prior views on race, starts the Organization of Afro-American Unity, and adopts the name El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. In the remainder of the lecture, Professor Holloway backtracks to explore some of the other historical events that frame the civil rights movement, including Freedom Summer, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, and the 1964 Civil Rights Act.",":  Alright, why don’t we go ahead and get started. I’m going to beg your–Welcome back from spring break. I hope you all had a lovely time of it. I have gotten sick right at the end of spring break, so if you can hear me in the back? Is that, is that fine in the back? I don’t have much more than this in the tank. Now, I know you’ve all done the reading for the week already and I know that you remember everything I was saying at the last minute before break, but just for my sake, I’ll just remind you that we were just wrapping up talking about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and the assassination of the four little girls in Birmingham, Alabama, essentially spending the time, much of our last week of lecture, dealing, dealing with these iconographic individuals and moments in Martin Luther King and the March on Washington, and trying to unravel a lot of the more familiar historiography or history around these individuals. What I want to do today is to continue in that work of reframing the Civil Rights Movement iconic figures and spend today’s lecture talking about Malcolm X.Now a couple of caveats, maybe just one caveat, to begin with is that for this week’s, this week’s lectures are going to be overlapping themselves, so that we have today talking about Malcolm X from say, well his, his biography essentially, till his assassination in sixty-five, and then on Wednesday, we’re going to go back over the time period between roughly ‘63 and ‘65. So the chronology’s overlapping.Okay, with that explanation out of the way, let me begin with a sampling of Malcolm X’s famous rhetoric, and this one is following the March on Washington. So we’re talking about now in August of 1963. It was a takeover. They controlled it so tight —— they told those negroes what time to hit town, how to come, where to stop, what signs to carry, what song to sing, what speech they could make, and what speech they couldn’t make; and then told them to get out town by sundown. (Walter Reuther, labor leader) Walter Reuther and those other three devils should get a Academy Award for the best actors because they acted like they really loved negroes and fooled a whole lot of negroes. This is again from , although he would respond to other people that the speech was nothing but a circus on other occasions, it’s delivered shortly before Malcolm X breaks with the Nation of Islam and Elijah Muhammad. The reading for this week, one of the readings, , excerpts, a collection of, of talks edited by George Brightman, are all ex–speeches from  to the end of Malcolm X’s life, a, a time period that’s rather important for reasons you’ll see as the course of the lecture–over the course of this lecture. The first is from–and I’ll let the two speeches run together. You’ll, you’ll notice the break, definitely. America today finds herself in a unique situation. Historically, revolutions are bloody. Oh, yes, they are. They haven’t ever had a blood-less revolution, or a non-violent revolution. That don’t happen even in Hollywood. You don’t have a revolution in which you love your enemy, and you don’t have a revolution in which you are begging the system of exploitation to integrate you into it. Revolution destroys systems. A revolution is bloody, but America is in a unique position. All she’s got to do is give the black man in this country everything that’s due him, everything. If you don’t see it you’re going to be coming–you’re going to become involved in some action in which you don’t have a chance. When two or three different countries have atomic bombs, nobody can use them, so it means that the white man today is without a weapon. If you’re going–if you want some action, you’ve got to come on down to Earth. It’ll be liberty or it’ll be death. And if you’re not ready to pay that price, don’t use the word freedom in your vocabulary.”:  That’s the end of the first clip. And the second clip begins right now.“We should defend ourselves. And when I say we should defend ourselves against the violence of others, that if they use their press skillfully to make the world think that I’m calling on violence period, and I wouldn’t call on anybody to be violent without a cause. :  So it’s important to ask, when thinking about Malcolm X, and these–playing these excerpts, are we hearing a different kind of voice? Are we hearing a different engagement or interpretation with the present moment, 1964? Is this what makes Malcolm X so different from Martin Luther King and other famous African American leaders? Well, you know by now that what he’s asking for in , the excerpt from the speech , he’s asking for civil rights. He says there’s no need for a bloody revolution, certainly. All he’s asking is for that–for the black man what is due him, he says in the quote. Is he doing something new when he’s asking for these things? You can go back to the Niagara Movement in 1905 and hear a lot of the same kinds of things that Malcolm X is seeking.Okay now the Niagara Movement wasn’t calling for violence upon violence, in, in response to violence, self-defense, not that way. So one might say well he was doing something new there. If you look back to Robert Williams in the 1950s, head of the NAACP chapter in North Carolina, something I’ve already brought up before and in your reader, he was calling for black men to, you know, gather up their arms and respond with force. So Malcolm X is talking really in a longer tradition, certainly a long tradition of calling for full civil rights and equality, and, and speaking in a long tradition as well, although much less talked about and much less consistent really, but always there, about violent self-defense, embracing violence, if, if this is–embracing self-defense, and if that means using violence, so be it. But like Martin Luther King, Malcolm X is frozen in time. And, you know, that’s how you kept it real, by walking around town wearing that kind of outfit, wearing Malcolm X, and his belief system, allegedly with an over–overpriced cap you’re wearing or the t-shirt. In fact, by the end of his life, he was not even known as Malcolm X, and he distanced himself in an incremental fashion from a lot of his most famous declarations in the early 1960s.So who is then Malcolm X? Let’s work through the biography. He was born in 1925. He’s assassinated in February 1965, less than a year after he breaks from the Nation of Islam. Both of them were very young men. So Malcolm Little is born in 1925. He’s known over the course of his life as Detroit Red, as Malcolm X most famously, and finally as El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. There’s different versions about Malcolm X’s early life and you know, forgive me, I will, I will often use Malcolm X in this lecture, just out of old habits.There’s not a whole bunch about Malcolm Little’s life. Malcolm Little drops out of school, moves to Boston and then to Harlem, and becomes a hustler. At twenty-one–and I’ve just, and I’ve encapsulated, or sort of put parentheses around the first twenty-one years of his life in just that little biographical sketch–at twenty-one, he’s arrested and sent to prison for burglary and larceny. He’s given an eight to ten year sentence and ultimately serves six and a half years. He’s paroled in 1952, about twenty-seven years old. The X is a reference to a long legacy of African Americans who were in an enslaved past who were given the master’s last name. And X is a, is a decoration that they are wiping out the slave name from their past, and they’re speaking to an unknown past, but claiming it as their own. That’s the full name. It’s a religious sect founded by a rather shadowy person, we really don’t know much about him at all, named Wallace Fard, founded around 1930. Fard disappears under curious circumstances. Now the Nation of Islam is a very unorthodox version of traditional Islam. The Nation of Islam grafts together black nationalism and some Islamic fundamentals. As the messenger of God, Elijah Muhammad would free his followers one day when Allah’s apocalyptic wrath finally destroyed whites. In the meantime, the black Muslims, followers of the Nation of Islam, the black Muslims would offer hope to blacks through self-discipline and self-help. Just as bizarre as any other Creation myth, I suppose, that’s out there. Anyway, this is what it is. This is one of the reasons the Nation of Islam is  traditionally–been so powerful at, or so successful at, converting people who are in prison. This is where the Nation is headquartered. Malcolm X, despite the interesting ways he’s been historicized, one cannot deny the fact that he’s an incredibly charismatic speaker, powerful speaker. And Elijah Muhammad asks, asks Malcolm X to be his–the national spokesman for the Nation of Islam. So very quickly, Malcolm X goes from jail to meeting Elijah Muhammad, to becoming assistant minister at the Detroit temple, to becoming the head of the Harlem temple, to becoming the spokesman for the Nation of Islam, although he’s not the head of the Nation of Islam.Under Malcolm X’s charismatic leadership, the Nation of Islam grows exponentially. It grows from several hundred followers to over ten thousand by the early 1960s. As Malcolm X continues to speak and advocate, the membership grows and new temples are established. Radio stations are purchased. Stores are opened up. The Steel Belt, Steel Belt, thinking along the, the northern, middle west of the United States, Ohio and Pittsburgh, heading across to Michigan, is becoming the Rust Belt, going through a period of deindustrialization. All of these things working together are increasing the numbers in the Nation of Islam, developing a broader support base. It is racially separatist. It’s not embracing any of the integrating logics of, of SNCC at that point, or NAACP, or other groups. Malcolm X, in fact, had represented Elijah Muhammad in the Nation in negotiations with the national heads of the KKK and the American Nazi Party. You have the same kind of mentality being expressed in the Nation of Islam. There are whisperings, as we get into the early 1960s, that Elijah Muhammad and the allegations he’s having affairs with teenage members of the Nation, whisperings he’s actually impregnated several members of the Nation, and then publicly rebuked the same young women for fornication, never naming himself in the process and getting them thrown out of the Nation. There’s also a tension created by the fact that Malcolm X is increasingly popular and although he’s not the leader of the Nation, because he is the spokesperson for the Nation, he is seen as embodying the Nation.So we’re in 1963. And Malcolm X very famously says, “It was merely a case of the chickens coming home to roost.”  That’s a response that Malcolm X meant to use to highlight the fact that JFK lived by the sword, and he was quite a saber-rattler as a President, that he lived by the sword and therefore he was going to die by it. Whether Malcolm X’s comment made any sense or not, it was a comment that horrified the country. He was not allowed to represent the Nation of Islam and not to speak on the Nation’s behalf. But the truth really does lie elsewhere in terms of Elijah Muhammad’s anxiety, growing anxiety about Malcolm X and his popularity, and also because Malcolm X had confronted Muhammad about his affairs, that he’d heard that these things were happening. And if you look back at it, you can see sort of the handwriting on the wall, because peppered throughout Malcolm X’s declarations would be, you know, that he speaks on behalf of the honorable Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm X establishes a religious organization called the Muslim Mosque Incorporated, and a political organization called the Organization of Afro-American Unity, thus reflecting, or creating, this two headed–or maybe these two organizations on, on separate paths. Certainly embodying a belief by Malcolm X that broad social engagement provided blacks the best chance for ending racism, not just a set of personal belief systems, but also engaging the battle on the ground. This was the political aspect of the OAAU, the Organization, Organization of Afro-American Unity that Malcolm X felt was lost–a lost opportunity for the Nation of Islam.Before establishing the OAAU, Malcolm X makes a hajj, a religious journey to Mecca, and during that trip has a stunning change of heart on race relations. Very famously in the autobiography of Malcolm X, written by Alex Haey, you see Malcolm X talking about meeting Muslims who were whiter than the whitest person he’d seen in the United States, blue eyes and blond hair. He had a very sort of immature notion of what traditional Muslim–Islamic faith was like and what Muslims would, quote, look like, even. His outlook, his political, religious, and ethical outlook, which certainly is revolutionary while he’s with the Nation of Islam, becomes increasingly anti-capitalist. Anti-capitalist thinking and rhetoric becomes much more important and is certainly a string that ties a lot of these individuals together, although that linkage is often not talked about.He rejects his prior views on race. He rejects his anti-Semitism. All of these are views that he espoused while in the Nation of Islam. He comes to recognize that women actually did have an important role to play in the political struggle. His prior views on race, race separatism, his, his notion of the role Jews played in the world system, his anti-Semitic views, his opposition to intermarriage, all of those are gone. There could be other organizations blacks could relate to, attach themselves to, as long as they’re working towards revolutionary change. In the end, Malcolm X acknowledged that his political views are rapidly evolving, embodied in the fact that he no longer goes by Malcolm X. El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz is the name he adopts during this last conversion.He admits, El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, that–when asked, that he was hard pressed to give a specific definition of the overall philosophy which he thought was necessary for the liberation of black people in the United States. He didn’t know at this point what the right answer was. There’s been rumor mills running nonstop since then about who was really behind the assassination, I mean, beyond the folks who actually pulled the triggers. Was it the FBI infiltrating the NOI, to find a way to assassinate Malcolm X, El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, although he’s no longer part of the Nation of Islam? Fact of the matter remains that Malcolm X, El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, is murdered February 1965.What does he leave behind? He leaves behind no great leadership legacy, but in terms of, you know, what organization was left, what did he do, he’d broken from the organization that had defined most of his life, his adult life. His views were shifting. Critics have said that his emotionalism, his powerful rhetoric, that he, he relied on it to win his cases and it’s also an emotionalism that, four years down the line, three and four years down the line, lent themselves perfectly well to the orthodoxies of the late 1960s, something we’ll see in next week’s reading, Eldridge Cleaver, .So his ideas were, you know, the, the, you know, the phrase is sort of nonsensical, you know, a person ahead of his time, the ideas that become popularized, that were popular when Malcolm X was alive, become popularized after his death, become the vehicle for establishing sort of a logic, organizational logic, for groups, that really don’t even exist when Malcolm X is alive. Now martyrdom, certainly a major element of the Civil Rights Movement. This is an era of martyrdom, you have Kennedy assassinated, November 22nd, 1963. And Johnson commits himself for the rest of his time in office to fulfilling Kennedy’s legacy on this agen–on this score. This is all happening in Mississippi, an important fact I just left out. I just remembered, sorry. So now again we’re back after King’s assass–Kennedy’s assassination.The goal of the Freedom Summer of sixty-four is to organize a real party, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, to establish freedom schools throughout Mississippi, sites literally of training Mississippi youth the basics of education, literacy being one of the basic elements of freedom schools, but also creating community centers for poor blacks to come to get food, to get clothing, and also to develop a political consciousness about the future–about the present, thinking about the future. In June of sixty-four, June twentieth, first wave of recruits comes down to help make Freedom Summer a reality. Andrew Goodman, a twenty-year-old from New York City, Michael Schwerner, a twenty-five-year-old from Brooklyn, and James Chaney, a twenty-one-year-old black Mississippian. Two white men and one black man.They’re arrested for speeding, a fairly common offense used by the police. The organizers for the meet–Mississippi Freedom Summer had a process that if you, if you get arrested at all, that you check in. This sends out alarms. Compressing a lot of history here, but based on their disappearance, LBJ sends in sailors, Navy divers, to start drag–dredging swamps, looking for Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney. They’ve just go to find them now. It says there’s going to be no discrimination in federally funded programs, something that  becomes important, I mean it’s important immediately, but becomes part of the debate in the–up to our present day, in fact. There are fights within Mississippi’s state delegation, within the state government, about trying to silence the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. Will it be the official delegates of the Democratic Party in Mississippi or will it be the delegates of the Freedom Democratic Party? Philadelphia, Mississippi.The bodies are riddled with thirty-eight caliber bullets. Chaney, sole black man, his head is, I’m sorry, his skull is fractured. He had suffered a savage beating. Eventually, twenty-one whites are arrested, including the deputy sheriff, all released by a state court. Eventually, six put on–into jail for violating federal civil rights laws, are given three to six years. David Dennis, the head of Mississippi’s CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality, when asked to give a eulogy for James Chaney, agrees to do so and to give a calming eulogy. When he gets in front of the crowd, in this moment of profound emotional turmoil and political turmoil, wrestling with the martyrdom of these three men, he snaps and says something quite off the script, and that’s exactly where we’ll pick up on Wednesday."
1,biomedical-engineering,beng-100,lecture-5,"Professor Saltzman reviews the concept of gene therapy, and gives some examples of where this is applied. Methods to help deliver DNA into cells using viruses and cationic lipids are discussed, as a way to overcome some challenges in gene therapy. Next, Professor Saltzman gives a brief introduction into bacterial and mammalian cell physiology. He describes the different tissues in the body, the cell development/differentiation process, the anchorage dependence of mammalian cells that allows them to form an organism, and the extracellular matrix.","There were a few things I didn’t get to finish last time in talking about particularly gene transfer in mammals. I want to finish with that and then start on the topic for this week which is an introduction to cellular physiology. In particular, cell culture technology or how you culture cells outside the body.This is the slide that I left on last time and the idea here was to use plasmids, which I talked about last Thursday, to introduce genes into animals. The cell is a fertilized egg, so you take a fertilized egg and you directly inject plasma DNA into the pronucleus, into one of the pronucleus–pronuclei. This solves a major problem which I’m going to talk about just at the beginning of class here in a slide or two, is ‘how to get DNA into cells?We talked last week, or the week before, about the plasma membrane and something about the chemistry of the plasma membrane: a lipid bilayer that’s stable in water because it’s arranged in such a way that the hydrophilic parts of the lipid molecules are exposed to both the outer and the inner surface of the cell. Because of that they’re barriers, they separate the inside of the cell from the outside of a cell, and only certain kinds of molecules can pass through a cell membrane. It has to be small, and it has to be lipid soluble in order for it to pass through a cell membrane.Well, plasmid DNA is neither of those. We talked about this a little bit in section last week, when you eat vegetables or meat, you’re eating a lot of DNA but that doesn’t enter the cells of your body because of the barrier properties of cell membranes. To get genes and gene transfer vectors into cells is a problem. The second issue is that the gene vector, in this case the plasmid, has to be compatible with the cells that you’re trying to express the gene in. that means that the cells have to be able to replicate the DNA on the plasmids, in order to make many more copies of it. It has to have an origin of replication, which we talked about last time, which is compatible with the cells.It also has to have a promoter for the gene that the cells can recognize. You’re taking advantage of a promoter system, or a gene activation system, that this species knows about because adult animals can make milk. Both of those things have to be correct. You have to be able to get the DNA into the cell, it has to be incorporated into a vector of some sort, and the vector has to be compatible with the species and the cells that you’ve provided the DNA to.In this case, if everything goes right, you inject the DNA into the pronucleus, you implant this fertilized egg into a foster mother, the mother gives birth to offspring, it develops and when it develops this foreign DNA is in the offspring. When this animal makes milk, it makes all the normal milk proteins, but it also activates your gene of interest as well. So you could collect your gene of interest in the milk. This concept of introducing foreign genes, genes that are made of recombinant DNA into animals using this kind of technique is widely used in biomedical research. One of the ways that it’s used is to take the fertilized egg from an animal, a mouse, usually it’s a mouse and inject in a vector that contains a gene that is involved in human disease of some sort.One of the big problems with studying human diseases is that you can study how they occur in people but there’s only a limited amount that you can learn from people. If animals get a similar disease then you can learn about that disease progression in much more detail in the animal. Millions of humans affected by Alzheimer’s disease, other species don’t get Alzheimer’s disease. Those animals that you produce are called transgenic animals because they’re expressing, usually at high levels, a transgene or a gene that’s not normally present in their species.How would you accomplish this kind of - how would you accomplish gene transfer in adult humans? You already have an adult organism and you’d like to get the gene transferred. Cystic fibrosis is a disease that affects many organ systems, but particularly the lung. The idea would be to try to give, usually in the lungs–people have thought about this because that’s where the main manifestations of the disease occur–and introduce a gene vector into the lungs, perhaps by having a patient inhale it or by somehow instilling into the lungs, in such a way that these gene vectors get taken up by lung cells and the gene gets expressed throughout the lung. Special lipids that do this are called cationic lipids. They’re lipids but they also have a charged portion, a positively charged portion which interacts with DNA. One way that that’s done is by introducing genes into cancer cells, genes that aren’t normally expressed in any mammalian cell, but that will cause the cancer cell to die. This is called a suicide gene. Basically, you’re introducing this gene into cells that when you give the right inactive drug that will cause the cell to make chemicals that kill it. The problem is the same, how do I get the gene that I want into only the cells that I want? You can see that it would be problem here if the gene that you were trying to give to the cancer cells also went to normal cells–that would be a problem. This is a common problem in gene therapy. You would like to get the gene that you’re interested in expressed in some population of cells within the body but not in other cells. So, making gene therapy specific is a key problem in making it work.These are two examples I just gave you of introducing genes that affect the life of a cell, either by making it express a protein that it’s not making properly that’s important to its life, or by intentionally killing a cell by having it express a fatal gene. The other examples on the bottom of the slide here are introducing genes that affect neighboring tissues. So one way to do this might be to - if you’re trying to treat a heart that has disease and usually it’s disease in one of the coronary vessels or the blood vessels that serve the heart, that provide blood to the heart. It occurs because blood flow gets reduced in that blood vessel and so the heart muscle, which is actively beating all the time, needs large quantities of oxygen provided by blood can’t get the blood through the vessel.Here, a concept is to introduce a gene that causes the process of new blood vessel growth. If you could introduce that gene you’d make the chemical, in this case it’s a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor. The name of the molecule isn’t important, but it’s a molecule that stimulates the heart to produce new blood vessels around it. This is introducing a gene, it’s a natural gene but it’s not - it’s a natural gene that’s found in humans and is actually expressed all over your body in different levels, but you’re concentrating it or over expressing it in one particular region of tissue in order to have a particular effect. Diabetics whose pancreas does not function properly, so don’t make enough insulin, don’t have enough insulin present for normal glucose metabolism so they can’t handle sugars properly. What if you injected the gene for insulin into their muscle so that their muscle cells in one particular location started making insulin? Then that insulin would accumulate in the muscle, enter the blood, and circulate all over the body and so you’d turn the muscle into an insulin making tissue. If you catch a cold you get exposed to someone who has a virus that’s causing an upper respiratory infection, they cough near you that virus enters your respiratory system, it infects cells of your respiratory system and those viruses replicate. You make a recombinant virus that has all the normal components of the virus but also has a gene that you want. Now, all you have to do is introduce that virus into an organism and the virus will do what it naturally does, which is infect some cells. The kinds of viruses that we get when we have colds are very good at infecting the respiratory system. That is also an advantage of using them as gene therapy vehicles because they will only infect cells that they are - that they have an affinity for or that they’re prone to affect.This picture here, we’re going to come back to this later in two weeks when we start talking about vaccines, and we’re going to talk about how you make vaccines for viruses and so in doing that we’re going to think about the life cycle of a virus. These very small particles are able to specifically recognize certain kinds of cells. They, in some cases, they integrate their DNA into the host chromosome, that’s what retroviruses do and they make viral proteins. That’s another advantage of using viruses as a gene therapy vector. They can reproduce and so you only need to give a few of them in order to make many, many inside the body.Why isn’t that the solution to gene therapy? If you can genetically engineer viruses like this and viruses have all those good properties as gene therapy vehicles that I described. Why isn’t this a solution? Retroviruses, for example, can only insert - can only transduce and express their DNA in cells that are dividing. These are some problems with retro viruses.Because of this people have sought other kinds of viruses to use as vectors and one that’s commonly used is an adenovirus. They can transduce non-dividing cells so that’s a good part. But if you’re trying to use that virus as a gene delivery vector and your body gets rid of it then the therapy has failed, it’s ended. People have tried to produce viruses that are different, adenoviruses for example, that your immune system can’t recognize. Why do we talk about them as the fundamental units? Let’s take a step back and ask are all kinds of cells really the same and start by talking about two cells that I know you know are quite different. Cells that I took from a human and cells that are in a bacterium.What are the differences between a bacterial cell and a human cell? What are some of the differences between a bacterial cell and a human cell?The bacterium doesn’t have a nucleus, and in fact, they don’t have very well formed organelles in general. Human cells have well-described organelles inside of them. Those things are all reviewed in the chapter in the book. Why is that the case? Bacterial cells are small, one to two microns in diameter and this shows a picture of a common bacterium called  This is a bacterium that’s normally present in humans; it colonizes all of our intestinal systems. Movement down a concentration gradient occurs fairly rapidly over short distances like a micron or so, like the size of a bacterium. Diffusion mixes things very well, but as the size gets bigger, diffusion becomes very slow. You’re familiar with this, if I had a jar of acetone or some kind of a volatile liquid, let’s say I have perfume. I have a jar of perfume and I sit it here, if the room was perfectly still the molecules of perfume would diffuse out of this jar and they’d start moving through the room and those of you in the first row would smell it within a few minutes, sometime later you’d smell it one row back, sometime later - and the farther away you get the longer it takes.Because of the physics of diffusion it doesn’t go linearly with distance. That is, it doesn’t take one second to go the first, and then two seconds to go to the second, and three seconds to go to third. These details aren’t important, it is described in your book, but the thing that is important to know is that diffusion occurs fast over short distances, but because of the physics of diffusion it occurs slowly over longer distances. Because of that, in order to efficient function, then you group all the like activities together. It’s - this picture on the bottom shows the cell stuck to plastic. Certainly that’s not what it’s like when it’s inside the body. Well, it’s true that it’s not stuck to plastic but it is stuck to other materials The other materials that it’s stuck to include other cells that surround it and this complex matrix which surrounds all of the cells in our body called extracellular matrix and I’ll get to that in just a few moments. Most of you have probably at some point or another learned about the cell cycle, or the process of a cell going from being a single cell to being two cells. That’s shown schematically here, let me talk about the bottom diagram first, which shows the process of mitosis. Mitosis is an orderly sequence of events by which one parent cell becomes two daughter cells. If this happens correctly, each of the new cells has exactly the same composition as the parent cell.Mitosis is one event that happens during this larger event called the cell cycle. It’s usually shown like a clock is shown here, where time 0, which is at the top here is right at the end of mitosis where you have two new cells that are formed. New cells are formed, they wait a bit, they synthesize DNA, they wait a bit, they divide, and on, and on, and on.Well, not all of the cells in your body are dividing at any one time. Those billions of cells come from successive rounds of cell division. Now, I said before that all cells are the same. So if that was all that was happening then an embryo would just be many, many cells that are all identical and you know that’s not the case. So we’re going to talk about that process more next time. What I want you to remember now is that abundant cell proliferation takes place during development. In fact, some cells are very different from the cells that are proliferating early in development. They’re red because they contain a special protein called hemoglobin which is very concentrated inside the cell. Well, it was not very hard for me to draw this red blood cell here, it’s just an oval, and one reason I draw it like an oval, is that that’s basically what it looks like if you look at it. One of the most obvious things about a red blood cell is it doesn’t have nucleus, it has no nucleus. They have become as different as they can be. That’s just an example of a cell that in its very mature or differentiated form is quite different from other cells inside the body.On the other side of this diagram I show a picture of a neuron. Neurons have these projections because one important property, or one important function of neurons, is to communicate with each other. The way that they communicate with each other is by physically touching each other, and the way that they connect across distances is by having these process that extend from one place to another. That’s obvious when you look at neurons and it will be obvious when we look at other kinds of cells as well.Because of this, often a biologist can discriminate between different kinds of cells that they see in section of a tissue for example, merely by its shape and the characteristics that it has. One could easily, for example, differentiate between a red cell and a neuron, but a skilled biologist who’s looked at many, many different cells could differentiate between different types of neurons. Maybe by the different branching patterns that these processes had, or how many processes were on a different kind of neuron, you’d be able to tell something about its function and probably something about where it came from. One of the important functions of a fibroblast is to allow for healing of wounds. Remember when I showed you that picture of cells attached to plastic a few minutes ago; I said those were fibroblasts that were growing on a culture dish.If I looked within the skin, one of the lower layers of your skin, the connective tissue layer, you’d find many fibroblasts there and they’re just waiting in a more rounded shape than this, just waiting to do their job. First, hopefully your blood clots and so that stops you from dying from loss of blood there, but your body tries to heal this wound that’s created. If you look at this picture of this fibroblast you can imagine that it’s firmly stuck up here. This is another example of how the shape of a cell can tell you something about its function, how you can discriminate between different cells by looking at how they look in their native environment.Humans are collections of cells, all cells are the same in important ways, but cells acquire differences during development, and so we are collections of billions of cells. What holds us together so that when I leave the room most of my cells go with me? What holds all these cells that are doing different things together? This tube, this hollow tube, which food passes through is made up of many, many epithelial cells which directly abut one another and would be a flat sheet except that it’s rolled up into a tube. One can imagine that when they’re inside this tube here, they’re still really outside the body. If it passed directly through the tube and nothing happened to it, it would come out to the outside world again. There’s a continuous path from the outside world right through the intestine. They become part of us, and the rest get - we get rid of and they remain part of the outside world.It’s these cells that are sitting at the surface here that are responsible for determining what becomes part of us and what stays outside. These junctions, these red dots here are actually made up of proteins, some are synthesized by one cell, some are synthesized by each other, and they lock together to form a very tight barrier, to form a tight junction between the two cells. In order for it to get inside the cells and go through them there have to be transporters which specifically allow glucose to pass into the cell and then out into our body. There’s a couple of features of cellular physiology which are shown here. The other is that this kind of adherence gives the tissue a property that’s useful, in this case the property is it can serve as a barrier to nutrients from entering our body.The other reason why cells stay together is that they’re surrounded by a matrix that’s called extracellular matrix. That matrix has properties that vary in different locations in the body, but basically it’s a highly hydrated or water-rich gel. You know what Jell-o is? It’s usually colored because there’s food dye in it, but it wouldn’t be colored in its natural state. Jell-o is just a hydrated solution of collagen and it contains a lot of water. Anybody’s mother make Jell-o with fruit in it? That’s how cells exist in extracellular matrix. The extracellular matrix or the collagen gel gives the tissue integrity, and in part, determines its mechanical properties.Where does the collagen come from? The collagen is excreted by cells themselves, so the matrix is made by cells. In fact, fibroblasts, which I talked about before, are very good producers of collagen, they produce the collagen matrix within which they live. Some cells digest collagen. Okay, I’m going to stop there and we’ll continue on Thursday."
2,political-science,plsc-114,lecture-22,"Three main features that Tocqueville regarded as central to American democracy are discussed: the importance of local government, the concept of “civil association,” and “the spirit of religion.” The book is not simply a celebration of the democratic experience in America; Tocqueville is deeply worried about the potential of a democratic tyranny.Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America, trans. Henry ReeveElectronic edition deposited and marked-up by ASGRP, the  at the University of Virginia, June 1, 1997"," Last time, I believe I said I wanted to discuss three features that Tocqueville regarded as central to American democracy. But of these three features, the first I talked a little bit about on Monday is the importance of local government, the township as it’s translated in this edition, what Tocqueville calls the “commune,” the community, community spirit, local government. He writes that, “in democratic countries,” one of the most famous sentences from the book, “In democratic countries, the science of association,” he says, “is the mother science. “In America,” if I can just quote him again, “In America, I encountered all sorts of associations, of which, I confess, I had no idea and I often admired the infinite art with which the inhabitants of the United States managed to fix a common goal to the efforts of many men to get them to advance it freely.” Struck by the immense variety and multiplicity and sheer number of these various kinds of civic association.It is important to see, perhaps, this is one area in which Tocqueville seems to most clearly depart from Rousseau, at least the Rousseau of the  after having said last time that his account of local democracy, township democracy owes so much to Rousseau’s account of the general will. But remember that Rousseau in the , would inveigh against, warned against what he called “partial associations,” partial associations like interest groups of various kinds that had the tendency to frustrate the general will, that stand, as it were, between the individual and the general will. But Tocqueville, on the other hand, regards these kinds of voluntary associations, associations of all sorts as precisely the place where we learn habits of initiative, cooperation and responsibility with others. “The heart is enlarged and the human mind is developed.” So you can see from a passage like that how much weight he puts on these civic associations. “The heart is enlarged. But they are also, as it were, the locus, the seedbed where citizens learn to become democratic citizens.It is very much important for Tocqueville that these associations, the absence of which he felt very acutely in France, which had already become a highly centralized society. This argument about the importance of civic association–I say it has become, in a way, the most talked about passage or part of the book in recent years–is due in large part to the influence of political scientist, Robert Putnam, a man who teaches at another university, a book called . You’ve probably maybe heard of that. Here, Putnam speaks about what he calls “human capital,” what Tocqueville, in less social scientific jargon, calls “habits of the heart,” mores, habits of the mind and heart. Joining with others in voluntary associations is a learned activity. It is something that requires a certain kind of culture and is a learned activity. His argument is that more and more people are, so to speak, choosing to “bowl alone,” something that shows an alarming tendency towards isolation and the subsequent kind of depletion almost of our civic capacities. The question is, taking Tocqueville to the present, have our capacities for joining with others been eroded by the forces of modern politics and technology? Now, one can say, and using the title “Bowling Alone” that Putnam is just speaking metaphorically, that he doesn’t mean bowling leagues. But let’s take him at his word and let’s find out if bowling leagues are, in fact, the ideal transmitter for democratic mores and values. We’re going to show a couple of clips about the  of men bowling. Again, otherwise, “Smokey” and “The Dude” and “Walter” would be a perfect example of democratic citizens. That is one of Tocqueville’s big questions. “I see the whole destiny of America contained in the first puritan who landed on its shores,” he says, “like the whole human race in the first man.” Our experience was determined in crucial ways by early Puritanism. I suppose in the twentieth century, Max Weber gave voice most prominently to that point of view that would be a process of secularization within modernity and a sort of gradual withering away of religious belief. Tocqueville shows that to be demonstrably false, that religion will not simply disappear as modernity moves forward and that the Enlightenment and its contemporary heirs, theorists of development and modernization and so on have been all together wrong about their confident predictions about the decline and withering away of religious faith.Secondly, Tocqueville takes it to be a terrible mistake to try to eliminate religion or to secularize society all together. This is, in fact, probably a more controversial, a very controversial claim. It was his belief, and again, perhaps here he’s influenced by Rousseau in the chapter on civil religion at the end of the  that free societies rest on public morality and that morality cannot be effective without religion. It may be true that individuals can derive moral guidance from reason alone, but societies can’t. The danger of attempting to eliminate religion from public life is that the need or desire to believe will therefore be transferred to other and far more dangerous outlooks. “Despotism,” he says, “can do without faith, but freedom cannot.” A very arresting sentence. “Despotism can do without faith, but freedom cannot.” “Religion is more necessary in a republic and in a democratic country than any other,” he says.But why is religion necessary to a republic? One persistent theme running throughout his book as a whole is that only religion can resist the tendency toward materialism and a kind of low self-interest that he believes is intrinsic to democratic ages and societies. “When religion is destroyed in a people,” this is Tocqueville. “When religion is destroyed in a people, doubt takes hold of the higher portion of the intellect and half paralyzes all the others.” When religion is destroyed, doubt takes over. It has a kind of a paralyzing effect on the will and our capacity for action. Religion remains a crucial prop for our beliefs about human dignity. He often writes as if religion is only valuable or valuable primarily for the social function it serves. “I view religion,” he says, “only from a purely human point of view,” he says. But I would ask, how accurate is that statement, or does it describe or characterize all of Tocqueville’s views about religion? I think not. Maybe you’ll have an opportunity to write about it at some other time. But remember that Tocqueville was not only a student of Rousseau.As he said in that letter to Louis de Kergolay that I mentioned last time, his other two great sources of inspiration were Montesquieu and a seventeenth-century French philosopher named Blaise Pascal. In one of his most famous statements, Pascal said, “A vapor,” a drop of water is enough to kill him, speaking of us, humans. “A drop of water is enough to kill us. Man is a reed, a reed, the weakest in nature, but he is a thinking reed.” We are weak. We think, but it is our weakness. It is our dependence, sense of dependence that struck Pascal. Tocqueville, you can find this in several passages throughout the . Tocqueville, I think discovered in Pascal a sense of kind of existential emptiness, an incompleteness of life that cannot be explained in terms of reason alone. Let me just read a sentence or two. “The short space of 60 years will never confine the whole imagination of man. The soul exhibits a kind of longing, a desire for eternity and a kind of disgust with the world and the limits of physical existence. “Religion,” he goes on, “is only a particular form of hope and it as natural to the human heart as hope itself. Disbelief is an accident. All is far from being well. Too often, way too often we read  as it if were simply a celebration of the democratic experience in America. It is not. In fact, it might create new forms of tyranny, democratic tyranny of which previous societies had been, perhaps, unaware. This is an issue that he treats twice in two important parts in his work; one in Volume 1, the other in Volume 2. I’m going to talk for a little bit today about his account of tyranny of the majority in Volume 1 and I’m going to save the rest of the discussion for next week when he talks about what he calls “democratic despotism” in the second part of .In Volume 1, he treats what he calls the “tyranny of the majority” largely in terms, you might say, that are derived or inherited from Aristotle and even the authors of . “Rule of the many,” for all kinds of purposes, generally means rule of the poor and rule of the poor for their own interest. The danger with democracy for Aristotle was that it still represented the tyranny of one class of society over the society of a whole, the largest class ruling in its interests over the minority. The greater the number of factions, the less likelihood that any one of them will be able to exercise despotic power over national politics.This is a question that Tocqueville returns to or turns to in that very important chapter from book one called “The omnipotence of the majority in the United States and its Effects,” which is, in many respects, a response or provides his reading and critique of the classical or traditional theory of democratic tyranny. The U.S. constitution, he talks about, has enshrined the majority in its own Preamble–“We, the People.” It has enshrined the majority even as it has sought to limit the powers of the people. Although Tocqueville devotes a great deal of attention in Volume 1– we’re not really reading these sections, I don’t think they’re all that important for our purposes–he spends a great deal of attention simply sort of describing the makeup of the federal constitution, the structure of the Houses of government and so on. Again, the  authors, following Locke and Montesquieu, believed all that was necessary was separation of powers, a system of representation, a system of checks and balances, that this could serve as an effective check on majority rule.But Tocqueville was less certain of that. Legal guarantees of minority rights, he thought, were unlikely to be ineffective in the face of mobilized public opinion. Why does Tocqueville believe that, or what led him to express such skepticism about even American democracy’s inability to check the prospect of democratic tyranny? Jacksonianism, for him, simply looked like an American form of Bonapartism, a military commander riding to political power on the wings of popular support. More than anything else, Tocqueville feared militarism combined with a kind of unlimited patriotic fervor. By having short elections or short cycles every two years in the House of Representatives, it was a way of making sure that the legislatures, the House, the Houses, are very close to public opinion and public control. But the most important and the most memorable aspects of tyranny of the majority have less to do with these institutional forms, you might, say. They do not come from something like that, but they are exercised in more subtle forms of exclusion and ostracism. It is the fear of ostracism, in some sense, the fear of being socially ostracized through which the majority exercises its control. Tocqueville’s statement here is, of course, that persecution can take many forms under a democratic people, from the cruelest to the most mild. He gives various examples of the crueler forms of the way in which the majority have expressed itself. He also uses the example of the way in which black voters in the state of Pennsylvania, and he focuses on this particularly, have been disenfranchised. He mentions Pennsylvania in particular because Pennsylvania is a Quaker state, that is to say a state where one would have thought liberal opinion towards questions of racial justice would have been most advanced. Even there, he says, the majority constrained African American voters from, free blacks, from voting.So these are ways in which, again, some overt and cruel and persecutory, others milder and through the form of ostracism that he wants to say that democratic sovereignty can exercise itself. It leaves the body alone and goes directly for the soul.” Well, there’s a wealth of commentary you might think about when you read that passage that’s implied there. Oh, God. There’s so much more. So that, for Tocqueville, is one of the other sides of the democratic experience. Again, I want to return to a piece of that on Wednesday, next week rather, Monday, because I think you will see in Volume 2, Tocqueville has something of a change of heart. I’ll try to finish whatever I can with Tocqueville on Monday and Wednesday I’m going to try to wrap things up and tell you what you should be thinking about. So anyway, enjoy yourselves and I’ll see you next week."
